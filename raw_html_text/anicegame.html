                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An icebreaker challenge and all the icebreaker games that we used to play.

                    Asks for personal information from one person, then prompts another to guess which of the three statements provided is a lie.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android-studio (XML and Java)
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be easier to put down the challenges we didn't run unto, but the main one was Git. And Android-studio.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an app that ACTUALLY WORKS. Kind of. Also we learned how to develop an Android app, which is useful and amazing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't use branches on Git. Just don't.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being made into a website (probably at some point in the future)
