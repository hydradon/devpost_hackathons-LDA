                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CES2017 - Razer lost a prototype laptop, which was stolen. According to a news article, at least 1,000 government laptops were reported lost and stolen since 2015. Government laptops missing entail possible leakage of sensitive data, which calls for a solution - iTrack.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iTrack is able to locate lost or stolen laptops via installation points using monitoring mode of a WiFi card. It will track the hidden WiFi card that can be installed into the laptops. In this hackathon, we are using a WiFi dongle instead due to constraints.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iTrack is built using Raspberry Pis with an external WiFi dongle. For the sake of the demo, 2 of the Raspberry Pis will be used as monitoring node to triangulate and track the lost device. A central server serves as a user interface to start the tracking service. It will also provide real-time updates to alert the user of the whereabouts of their lost device.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Not enough power supplies to power up our Raspberry Pis. 2. Not enough hardware knowledge to build a wireless card. This demo is a proof of concept.
