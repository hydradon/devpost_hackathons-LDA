                </h2>
                <p>
                    For parties, concerts and silent discos...
The glasses currently cycle through patterns that flash/change when the microphone (or amplified sensor) detects music not only by amplitude, but now by frequency. By using the MSGEQ7 Graphic Equalizer Display Filter IC, I did not have to use an overly complicated and slow FFT done by the Arduino Pro mini. The Glasses can work with not only background music, but can work with headphones as well. The additional loose microphone on the right side of the glasses are intended to go into a pair of over-ear headphones, which make them well suited for silent discos.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Glasses kit (Frame + Arduino Pro Mini + Neopixel LED Matrix), and my MSGEQ7 Graphic Equalizer Display Filter breakout board interfaced with 2 microphones.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Debugging my perfboard circuit for the MSGEQ7. Soldering at 3-4 AM in the morning is not exactly the greatest idea in the world.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At PennApps XIII, I am proud to say that these Glasses are now officially usable with audio and are party worthy.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first PennApps (XII), I did not have the proper hardware and sensors to interface with the glasses. I ended up direct connecting a gigantic battery pack and a audio device to the glasses. There was no microphone and and integrated battery pack, so I could not really pitch it well. Over the course of semester to until now, I have learned not only my limitations, but the Arduino Pro Mini's as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RGB Rave Shades
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I still plan on developing an Android app and even an app for my Motorola 360 smartwatch, to interface and even use the sensor data off of these devices to trigger more patterns and effects on the glasses. If everything works out, I might even go to market with these.
