                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a centralized platform to organize study groups and ultimately improve habits
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to input times, dates, and material for others to join in and study together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a front-end website in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We used multiple pages for login/register and incorporated bootstrap's CSS classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us never created a full application so setting up GitHub and learning how to contribute was a big task. It was also difficult because not all of us knew how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone learned much more about the process to create something useful. After a lot of back and forth for ideas and troubleshooting, we proud that we were able to produce something together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that GitHub has a huge learning curve and it's really difficult to learn Javascript on a four-hour car ride. Ultimately, each member of the team was about to confidently contribute through the skills they learned
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackPro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to create a backend and update much of the front end. We also need to incorporate a full database. Everyone is really excited to make this project the best it can be.
