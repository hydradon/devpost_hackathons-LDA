                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mathematics is beautiful, sometimes it is nice to put on a pair of glasses to help see it! With this project I offer a new type of glasses that will help show you some of the symmetrical mathematical beauty.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For this project, it will be utilized for a beautifully smooth fractal traversal visualization.
This is similar to the idea within the zooming into a fractal, however this only explains one frame of the visualization overall.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Tied together lots of research papers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spent my first few hours at the hackathon asking questions about everything I could to try to discover helpful resources around me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Worked for 21 hours with minimal breaks, what do you want an actual breakdown of my time?

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compiling code against different library versions... tensorflow + tensorflow gpu + tensorflow.js, all just for compiling different sections of code, this was fun to learn about!
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Out of the 5 major goals I set for myself I got to a usable API for two parts. For two more of them I had to compromise and utilize a model that existed online so that I could save time. For one of the ideas it turns out that I went a different direction due to complexity in the minimized model creation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am getting quite good at charting out a project idea for myself, however I need to decrease the final tie together, or potentially drop a part earlier. Overall I learned more about implementation of newer ways to work with machine learning.
