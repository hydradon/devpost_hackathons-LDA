                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Earlier this month, after paying significantly more for a gallon of milk at a grocery store closer to my home than I usually pay at a grocery store that's farther away, I realized that there's no central database of products where we can browse for a product's availability in various stores around us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Boilermake I met 3 like minded people and we decided to fix this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app scans a purchase receipt and then stores the data, such as the product name, its price and the store where it was purchased.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A user can search for a product, for example coffee, in our app, and then he/she will find the cheapest available option.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our iOS app has been coded in Swift3.0 
We have used Microsoft's Computer Vision API to get text from an image of a receipt.
We have used Node.js as our backend.
We have used MongoDB as our data storage solution.
We have used Cocoapods to make JSON parsing in Swift simpler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data that we received from Microsoft Computer Vision API wasn't as precise as we had anticipated so we had to change our approach about midway through the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    None of us had any prior experience with NodeJS, MongoDB and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product that we have created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The value of perseverance.
And the fact that it doesn't hurt to ask for help when we need it.
