                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came when a member of the team mentioned reading a story about a stroke victim who was not able to call emergency services in time as they did not have enough information regarding the incident. Usually, hospitals or other emergency services do not have information on their patients/callers before they get to the hospital, or they come to you. We decided to solve this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app ensures that emergency services near you know all relevant information that might concern you (medical conditions, age, location, etc) all with one text message of your address. You register as a user on the site, and when in a case of an emergency, will notify the closest emergency service to you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project's backend in Node.js with the Express.js framework. The backend made great use of a MongoDB database, using mongoose to model the database objects. The entire backend functioned as a RESTFUL API, in order to let the frontend receive the required information through URL requests with Axios. The front-end was developed with React.js, making use of the popular and versatile Material-UI React framework. In order to deliver the text messages to our backend, we made use of the Twilio API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was getting the data to transfer from the Twilio API to our database. Additionally, it was a difficult task to obtain the closest emergency service near you, and we used complex longitude and latitude formulas in order to complete this task. These two problems took up a lot of our time in the creation of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that our authentication and backend was fully functioning by the end of the project. 
The project is extremely efficient and has nearly no delay in the transfer from the user's SMS message to the changes in our database, which almost immediately updated the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is always important to structure the project before you begin so it doesn't waste your time. Our team has felt that we have developed skills using the frameworks and libraries incorporated in this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quick Alert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Quick Alert would be to add more details about users so services know more about them by including extra input fields, and also adding a more personalized user page to update and edit their information.
