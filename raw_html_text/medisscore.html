                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HealthCare Biopark offered the challenge to create an app which would help doctors to determine and compare the severity of injuries of their patients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Usually, patients coming into hospitals receive a paper wristband with a barcode on it storing their personal data (name, birth etc.). With our application, the user (usually a doctor) can scan the barcode to create a new patient file and can then specify the location and type of injury by selecting the predefined body parts. With this info, the app is able to calculate the so called ISS CODE, which contains the severity of injury (maximum value of 75).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The building process is divided in three parts: we built a  background logic to calculate the ISS score, we parsed the .csv file of data of different injuries (and their degree of severity) into a JSON file so that we can better access it in the ionic app. Furthermore, we created an interactive mockup of the app including a barcode scanner for the patient wristband.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few challenges with parsing the .csv file to JSON and structuring the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the implementation of the barcode scanner as well as the structure of the app concerning its usability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to use the ionic framework and about the challenges the medical sector faces when it comes to categorizing patients&rsquo; injuries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MedISScore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We still need to find a way to parse the data of the .csv file automatically into the application in an efficient way and implement the data of each patient into the patient file. 
Ideally, the app will be optimized in a way which makes it usable for the local hospital in Regensburg.
