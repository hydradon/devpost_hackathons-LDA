                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The time it takes to think of ideas and activities to do for a fun night out takes away from the experience. We want to solve this problem.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives a list of activities to choose from and finds these activities in the nearby locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly relied on google places and map APIs to get the data we need. We told inspiration from GitHub examples of programs that attempted to do similar things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API was really hard to understand to find nearby places. We spent a lot of time finding our own location, which gave us less time to find locations nearby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our idea and how it can have real-life applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google APIs! Also, working within a team on a software project, and how hard a seemingly "simple" app can be to implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NightOut
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal for NightOut is to take the user's budget and preferences to sort out a good itinerary for their night out. We also want to use more accurate cost predicting databases.
