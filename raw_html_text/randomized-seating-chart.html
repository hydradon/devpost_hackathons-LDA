                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My chemistry/ Intro to Engineering teacher mentioned teachers needs of a program that makes randomized seating easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program allows the user to add tables, and  students, who can be randomly assigned to a certain seat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Eclipse as our IDE and Java. We used the Processing library to help integrate graphics into the program as well as provide common features such as moving objects, or using keyboard functions and on screen buttons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it hard to move the objects independently when colliding with other objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main accomplishment that we are proud of is the fact that we were able to make an idea into reality in 24 hours. In addition, we got more experience of how to store files and open them within the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to do input/output storing useful information and reading it back to the program.
                </p>

                    What's next for Randomized Seating chart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would try making a nicer GUI, as well as fixing some bugs.
