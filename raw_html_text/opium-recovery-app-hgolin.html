                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technology is everywhere. What this team constantly argues is the necessity of solutions, specially mobile apps, with social health impact. That is what we strive to do, in fact, other projects that we have worked on are related to suicide prevention, cancer patients therapies and obesity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By being a multi-culture team, we find differences and similarities in our culture backgrounds. One unfortunate similarity is the abuse of illegal drugs and the vast damage they cause in society.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Opium Recovery app helps patients in medication assisted treatment for opiate drugs addiction recovery. With the use of motivations, trigger identification, relapse capture and education materials, this app helps the user persevere in the addiction recovery process.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a distributed team, we used a series of technologies to allow our remote collaboration such as Invision, Github and Slack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One big challenge were the limitations on the competition rules. The fact that certain information is not allowed to be retrieved or managed within the app directly affects the availability of the features that can be offered. For example, it was our team desire to implement wearable technologies for the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel particularly proud of our remote collaboration. Additionally, regardless of the result of this competition we want to promote this app on healthcare centers, government and private drug addiction treatment institutions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the recovery process. Without coming from medical backgrounds, we have a very solid understanding of the medication and treatment options for drug addiction. This is actually another point we are very proud of not only for this projects, but for every project we work on we learn about areas beyond our expertise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Opium Recovery App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really are waiting for a positive outcome on this competition in order to continue with the project. That is, polish our UI, increase the set of features and conduct more user testing. However, as I said before, we will do this regardless of the results of this competition.
