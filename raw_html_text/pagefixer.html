                    You know how your always seeing badly designed websites. This can help
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A constant part of the online experience is encountering websites that are perhaps less than ideal. Browser extensions can fix this but they can be tough and cumbersome to create. I've been making such a plugin for some of our universities pages and so I decided to make a plugin to automate the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Reality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    36 hours is not enough to finish such a project completely especially as a single developer who also needs to sleep occasionally. What I have managed to finish is a class to render a simple file format with support for adding elements, removing element, editing params and attributes, and looping these rules over all the child elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally I have an interface to allow this functionality through a context menu in the browser. A browser action turns the mode on and then elements can be right clicked to add elements
                </p>

                        Context Menus aren't easy or simple to use.

                    <li>
                        Editing based on the file format, but more importantly making a simi-nice looking interface.

                    <li>
                        How context menus work in the browser (why is Firefox the only one to implement the standard.

                    <li>
                        Extracting and reuse of information from tags.
