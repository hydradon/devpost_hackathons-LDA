                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the crazy number of students who are uneducated about their own alcohol tolerance, and as a result get themselves into dangerous situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to keep track of the number of drinks you have consumed, while giving an estimate of your blood alcohol content and a corresponding wait time before drinking another.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one of our teammates had used this software before, so sharing ideas between the various skill sets proved difficult.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emulators are very problematic!
