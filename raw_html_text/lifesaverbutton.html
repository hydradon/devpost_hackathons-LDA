                    A year ago, one of the team member's grandpa had a heart stroke. Although he was in pain, no one was home to help him up. Till now, we do not know how to solve this problem. To prevent this problem from happening to not only the elderly but to anyone who has strokes or you, we created a button in which will alert the caretaker or anyone close.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With just a press of a button, we can save your or a close loved ones life. Have you ever had a family member who you are worried won&rsquo;t be okay by themselves? We have created a solution to this problem. Now with just a press of a button we can send a text message to emergency services, and send help. This is created using a particle board known as Photon that runs on its own IDE.
