                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever people applied for leave in the Payroll portion of Xero we were manually creating a calendar item and inviting people to it - just so they could see when people were on leave. We decided to make an easy way for everyone in the organisation to be able to see leave.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes the leave data from the Xero Payroll API and publishes it to any popular calendar readers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How? Our process extracts approved leave data from Xero every night and puts it into an iCal format. The url to the custom iCal file can be added the end-user calendar (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc) - the calendar tool then makes sure the user always sees the latest leave data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've gone for a completely server-less model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use Node.js running on AWS Lambda for our back-end - it talks to the Xero API to handle the authentication and to talk to the Xero Payroll API (AU).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The front end is React javascript that sits in an AWS S3 bucket (presented through AWS CloudFront so we can make it SSL).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The React code talks to AWS API Gateway to communicate with the Lambda functions, and uses AWS Cognito to handle all of our local authentication and user management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Lambda functions access/store their data in an AWS RDS instance (MySQL).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The finished iCal files sit in another S3 bucket and are access directly by the user's calendar apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The xero-node npm package doesn't yet support the payroll API so we had to create this ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A completely server-less stack means we don't have to worry about capacity or patching our servers - AWS abstracts us away from all of that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also pretty cool that we don't have a GUI for the end user - all they have to do is add the URL to their preferred calendar application and we do the rest behind the scenes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the Xero API is pretty cool and well documented and that AWS has a pretty broad suite of tools that can be pretty powerful when connected together (in the right way!).
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Allow orgs create multiple calendars - allowing them to see leave by department (rather than for everyone)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Leave alerts that let people get alerted to leave in the organisation or just in their department
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Capacity reports so services businesses can get an accurate view of their capacity including leave
