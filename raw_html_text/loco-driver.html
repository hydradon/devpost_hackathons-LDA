                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People tend to be bad drivers sometimes, even including the authors of this project. Therefore, we tried to come up with the way to increase self-awareness about their driving skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application tracks the user's drive manner and tells him how awful he is at driving. (literally, the larger index, the worse driver is).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used deep learning implemented with python (tensorflow) in order to create models of good driving and bad driving. The models were created from images taken with a camera attached to the front of the car. The idea of the app is to have used upload a video of their driving and the python script would generate the driver's score on an online. The app would have been hosted on node server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part was to build a bridge between node.js and python, also we bumped into significant challenges with hardware. Our goal was to have the machine learning algorithm run along the side of the online app.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to say that after our initial project of a remote control car that

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should be careful with our hardware.

                <p>
                    Loco Driver will live on in our hearts.
