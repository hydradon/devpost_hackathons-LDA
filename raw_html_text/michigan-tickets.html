                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hated how difficult and unorganized buying and selling football tickets was on the Facebook Buying and Selling Football Tickets page was, so we decided to make an app that would be able to connect buyers and sellers easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows users to submit ticket offers to other users, and potential buyers can look at all the available tickets and decide the best deal for them.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used firebase as a database to store the offers for each ticket, and Android Studio to build the app
                </p>
