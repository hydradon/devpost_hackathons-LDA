                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us have multiple credit cards and have to make payments for each of them on different dates. It is hard to remember the due date of each credit card and which ones you have already paid and which ones you haven't. Now you can use Credit Card Tracker to do it for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You add your credit cards to this skill by choosing a name for each card, providing the last day of billing cycle and the grace period for that card. Once you have added all your cards, you can ask the Credit Card Tracker to list all your cards or check the status of individual one. 
Once you make the payment, you ask the skill to mark it as paid, so you don't have to worry about missing the payment. You can also delete the cards by saying "Delete my credit card".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used ASK SDK for Java to build this skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first skill I built using Dialog Interface so I had to try couple of times to make it working properly (user's response validation, user's confirmation, ...)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It  is now much easier to build multi-turn conversation between the skill and user using the Dialog Interface feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Credit Card Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next step would be adding settings for each user (i.e.skipping paid cards in list), adding confirmation before deleting card.
