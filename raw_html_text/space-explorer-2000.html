                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've wanted to make a hexagonal grid-based game for a while, and decided that CrimsonHacks would be a good opportunity for it. Throughout my life I have had a passion for video games and drawing, and learning how to develop video games has allowed my passions to come together in interesting ways. I can always get inspired to make video games!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game was designed to be fun to play and visually enjoyable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity and C# to build the game, and drew designs in my sketchbook to help with brainstorming gameplay ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had some difficulty getting the player to turn and look at the mouse, but eventually figured out how to convert the mouse coordinates into world coordinates in the game so as to figure out the correct rotation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I completed this game within 24 hours. I think that this is one of the most complete games that I've made in this short of a timeline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about some neat looking fonts when designing the game. I also gained experience in designing menus which can be enabled and disabled from code in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Space Explorer 2000
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think that I may go back to this project to add items which reduce the risk value seen in the upper left of the game. Having items randomly appear that decrease the risk value would allow for more complex gameplay. Also I would like to add more story through illustrations and captions.
                </p>
