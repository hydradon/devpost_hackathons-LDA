                    Inspiration: I am very much into web design and I decided to test myself to see what I could do in such a short time. I enjoyed this hackathon, and so I decided to use it as my subject material.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It shows the experience of this year's hackathon from a hacker's perspective.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I used html and css and built it from scratch.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: I had some issue with content as I was working with information I was getting from the hackathon.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I was under the impression that we had till 7pm to submit our entries. I am glad that I was able to create a somewhat decent site despite my rushing toward the end.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I refreshed my understanding of the HTML and CSS languages.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for KnightHacks 0.5: I am hoping to beautify it when I go home and add it to my portfolio.
