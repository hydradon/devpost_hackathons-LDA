                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We, as hackers, all know the feeling: we start to work on a project an time just flies. Sadly, after work is done we often feel exhausted, frustrated, dehydrated and sore due to hours and hours of sitting infront of a PC whithout getting up, making breaks, drinking or airing the room. We want to change that. Our goal is create a working environment, which allows us, the people working at home, in front of computers, to finish work feeling satisfied and fresh while also enhancing the productivity during work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does (or rather what it should do)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WRKMD uses the OSRAM Smart+ lights to create a lighting which:
                    <br>
                    a. enhances productivity by exploiting the effect (blue) lighting has on our circadian rythms
                    <br>
                    b. uses subtle light signals to animate the user to stand up or to drink from time to time
                </p>
                <p>
                    Features in Detail:
For our prototype we use two lights, 1 Osram Smart+ LED ZigBee Lamp and 1 Osram Smart+ ZigBee RGB LED Strip. The latter is used for the light signals. Both are used for the productivity enhancing ambient light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feature "ambient light":
The general idea is to that the lighting depends on the daytime, how long the user is already working and optionally some other parameters. This should result in a light which enhances productivity but also does not stress the eyes to much at night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feature "stand up signal":
In certain intervals the user is reminded by a certain light signal (via the strip) that he should stand up and move a little bit.
The software should use the motion sensor to register when the user gets up. After getting up the signal color should slowely fade away and the strip should take on the color of the ambient light again, signaling the user that he can may sit down again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feature "drink signal:"
In certain intervals the user is reminded to drink in a very subtle way using a certain light signal (via the strip). This signal should fade away after a short time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UI:
The goal is a simple, distraction free User Interface. For our prototype we only want a web app which allows the user to start, stop and pause the workmode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WRKMD
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There could be signals for other features such as a reminder to air the room using the "bad air"-sensor.
Pause automatically when user leaves the room.
