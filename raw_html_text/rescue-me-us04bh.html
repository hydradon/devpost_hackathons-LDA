                <p>
                    In the light of recent events in Houston and Florida, we found that when disaster strikes, there are a lot of people who need help and a lot of people who want to offer help. However the system is ridden with inefficiencies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Multiple platforms, organizations, social media create an information overload, where a volunteer feels overwhelmed with the people and areas that need their attention.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Human dispatchers have to answer calls from victims, manually note down their details and again manually direct volunteers to them. Their access to volunteers is limited and the process is overwhelming, stressful and inefficient as brought to light by

                <p>
                    We wanted to eliminate these issues and simplify the way volunteers can reach and rescue those in need, while also ensuring the process is personal and assures human contact.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a web application using Node.js with a PostgresSQL database system. We used Nexmo's SMS API to send text messages to facilitate the rescue mission and MapQuest's Geocoding API to associate a user's co-ordinates with their address to match volunteers and victims. We used React.js and responsive design to create a minimalistic user interface that can be accessed from any device.

                <p>
                    People requiring help are often stressed and in duress. The design of help requests needed to be extremely intuitive and easy to use. Tech used needed to be simple and lightweight so that connectivity is possible even with unreliable network.
