                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people all around the world are leading increasingly sedentary lifestyles. Some of us may be sedentary by choice, but many of us don't have a choice. We just have to spend extended periods of time sitting down, without much physical activity because of our jobs or studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind this idea is my dad who is an academic and researcher by profession. His work requires him to spend large periods of his time sitting down without physical activity and this has been taking a toll on his health. I had recently installed an Echo in his office and I hope this skill will give him some ideas with respect to some physical activities which he can do in his breaks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, being a college student and having to study for extended periods of time, this skill fills a need in my life too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill suggests some simple physical activities that one can do in their study or office breaks. It also logs the number of workouts you do. Here's a break down of the features:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Suggest activity
                    </strong>
                    : Ask Desk Workout to suggest a workout and Alexa will respond with a simple physical activity that you can perform. You can try the activity as she narrates it. Breaks are provided for the same. At the end, Alexa will ask you if you would like to perform the activity. If you respond in the positive she will add 1 to your workout logs. If you respond in the negative, she will suggest another one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Know Your Logs
                    </strong>
                    : As mentioned above, Alexa automatically logs your workout whenever you respond with a yes when she asks you whether you want to perform the activity. You can know your logs any time by simply asking "tell me my logs."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill has been built using the Alexa Skills Kit for Node JS and DynamoDB is used for storing the logs. The skill was hosted on AWS Lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was coming up with the content which should be easy enough to follow along by just hearing the description.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of getting the skill to work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about VUI principles: fresh content requirements, ease of use and a lot more!  Also got the opportunity to hone my JavaScript skills!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Desk Workout
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to update it with visuals so that it works even better on an Echo Show or Echo Spot. Also would like to come up with more content and further improve the VUI!
