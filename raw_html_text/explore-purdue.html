                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We asked some people nearby what kind of program we should make, and someone told us we should make a game like hide and seek that let people guess where others were when given a picture. Although that game would have been nice to make, we wanted to make a game that was a little bit different. We implemented part of the idea so that instead of playing with other people, the player would play in single player and receive a picture and a map on where to guess they were in the picture. And because we wanted to make this program a part of Purdue, we made the locations centered around Purdue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game quizzes the player on where a picture they were given was taken. They have three different choices dictated by the red circles. The goal is to choose the right circles and get to the end without missing anything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a local website using github and created the website using HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we wanted to use a database to store the images in and domain to host the website on, but we couldn't figure out how to work the database and domain, so we ended up just using a local one. As a result, we had very little time to perfect this local version of the game we were originally planning.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the entire site to run smoothly and there are very little bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to pursue a path less time-consuming and difficult when on a time crunch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Explore Purdue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had originally planned for there to be about ten to fifteen easy and medium level difficulty pictures and another "Expert Mode" stage that you could choose in the menu that had about five to ten extremely difficult pictures, but because we didn't have enough time, we couldn't fit everything in. If we had more time, we would include a high score and an index to go back over the places, as well as a hint button for people who are stuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, if time permitted, we would also find a way to use the mouse coordinates as the user's guess and perhaps finally figure out how to use database and domains.
