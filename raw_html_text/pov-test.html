                    Inspiration I wanted to make something simple that could incite the interest of children in 5th grade to middle school level or perhaps anyone to take an interest in technology in a fun engaging, personalized way.

                    What it does it produces a set of lights in binary code based on the letters it is set to produce in a pattern.

                    How I built it using a premade method and adjusted it to arduino 101
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into, was adjusting the code to suit what I built and building my device to do what i wanted

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of learning how to use an arduino board and the different sensors
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned light sensors are really hard to work with when you dont know what you are doing and working with pre existing code
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for POV Test it can be adjusted for students in developing countries to take an interest in technology and since it was simple for a non CSE major to understand it is much easier to explain and fun to play with at the same time.
