                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stemmed from the UW Alerts system and the general abundance of car break-ins and thefts in Seattle. Many people, especially non-Seattleites, assume that certain parts of the city are inherently dangerous, and are nervous about the potential risk of parking their vehicle in an unknown neighborhood. We wanted to break down this misconception by providing information about the safety of a parking spot's area, so that people are either better informed about danger or have their fears assuaged regarding areas they were unsure about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app assists outside visitors to new communities by suggesting recommended parking spots at their destination through data driven analytics based on break-in statistics, parking rates, and several other features in the surrounding area.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first made a prototype of the potential app interface. Then we split up into two groups working on the back-end and the front-end of the app. For the back-end, we used Python and Flask, while for front-end we used HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was tricky implementing the Google Maps API for our intended app functionalities. We have no prior experience in mobile apps so we had to design a web app. We struggled with replicating our initial prototype layout, so our final UI looks different.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideation and prototyping was fun! We also enjoyed implementing the Shine API and a crime dataset from the City of Seattle Open Data portal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained insight into the types of issues surrounding transportation in Seattle. Some of us also got to work with languages and technologies they hadn't used before, such as Bootstrap and Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Parkour
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Turn it into a mobile application as that is the platform that will most likely be used.
Expand the app to other urban areas besides Seattle. Include a function that lets you file a police report if you are the victim of a break-in or theft.
