                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collectible card games like Magic the Gathering sell their cards in packages.  The sum value of the cards in each pack is not known because the pack is sealed.  This adds an element of chance that the end user is willing to pay for.  By obscuring the value of the cards backing the package, more value is created! Using an NFT backed by a prize which is hidden to the owner we can accomplish this same increase in value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates a token backed by an amount of ETH which is unknown to the owner.  The owner can burn their token and retrieve their prize at any time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Burnable ERC 721 token contract along with an Enigma Secret contract.  When the user decides to claim their prize they call the enigma secret contact.  The secret contract grabs the value of the prize and, in an ethereum callback, burns the NFT
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First interaction with Rust, drizzle, and TEE
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stretched our abilities. Learned many new technologies and are excited about future applications
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Great first exposure to Rust and Enigma.

                    What's next for LootBoxToken
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the name of or project suggests, Loot Boxes in a gaming setting is a perfect application of this general idea.
