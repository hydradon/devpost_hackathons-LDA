                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group of double minorities, we were inspired to ease access to resources for students like us, since scholarships and internships for students of color are often difficult to gather.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 7 Sisters Hub offers a convenient resource for students at the colleges to find resources for scholarships, internships, and career planning based on their interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by thinking about ways that we can benefit minority groups. Going to college is an important part of one's life, and it can be rather difficult for people of color, as well as people who come from low-economic status. Thus, we started gathering information of a handful of internships and scholarships that catered specifically towards women, low-economic status, or people of color.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble implementing a search bar feature that would iterate over all of the data and return specific programs based on the user's input of keywords. On the non-technical side, it was a bit difficult to find resources for career planning.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of having created a functional website, with little to no prior experience in web development.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the process of this project, we've learned a lot about the importance of planning and reaching out to resources for assistance.
                </p>

                    What's next for The 7 Sisters Hub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to incorporate a forum that will allow students opportunities to discuss their own experiences with applying to and/or participating in such internships and scholarships. Additionally, we want to implement search bars on the scholarships and internship pages in which students can further narrow their search for programs.
