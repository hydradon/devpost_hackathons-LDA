                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend of ours has a mother who has a prescription in Costa Rica.  During one of her visits in the US, she forgot her medicine back at home.  When in the US, she struggled to find an equivalent version of her prescription.  This friend told us her story when we asked for project ideas.  For the past 24 hours, we have made it a personal goal to help others in her situation.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Eclipse, we built our own custom data base which could store all necessary data.  From there, we adapted this for Android so smartphone users have access to our solution.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues with converting our app to android and issues with scanning our data.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon and the very fact that we built a product is mind blowing.  We are proud of each other, but more importantly, we are proud of what our app can do.
