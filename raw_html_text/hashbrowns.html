                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stereotypical Tumblr content and users.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses neural networks and AI techniques to process a series of text in the form of forum posts in order to generate similar content for a bot-controlled Tumblr blog.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Python browser emulation framework to scrape information of internet subcultures.  We wrote custom cleanup script to sanitize the training data.  The training data was analyzed using a mult-layer recurrent neural network for word-level language models in Python using TensorFlow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Processing training data in time.  It takes a long time to process training data, so it is still going on as I type this.  Scraping data from multiple forum layouts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully extracting forum content from a wide variety of website layouts. Utilization of a recurrent neural network for word level language models, application of amazon web services to run the neural network for efficient processing of training data.
