                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The limited opportunities women have access to because of socio-cultural factors.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Platform to distribute micro-loans to small business owners and provide access to mentorship and resources to help them achieve their goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the WhatsApp interface through Twilio and Python. Then we created a flask web application which will be able to send and receive messages. Then the application was deployed to Heroku for continuous integration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That the platform would have to be accessible in rural areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we are different from other micro-loan platforms in that we provide guidance and mentorship for business and life skills that women may not have access to otherwise.
That we deliver our service through WhatsApp, enabling all women, no matter where they are to access our resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The difficulties that women face and that the core issues preventing them from achieving their potential are education, empowerment, and confidence.
                </p>
