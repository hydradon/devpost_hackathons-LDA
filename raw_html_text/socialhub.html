                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    socialhub was inspired by the typical life of a programmer. We go to many networking events such as hackathons, and we are encouraged to network with other hackers/sponsors. When connecting with other hackers, it's tedious to note down all their social media outlets, especially when the usernames vary, and manually go through each social media website. socialhub solves this issue...

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    socialhub allows users to signup for an account and create a unique page, where they can add all of their social media. Users can choose which social mediums they want to share, if you only want to share your insta bangers...you can!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created socialhub with meteor.js, a full stack platform that performs many under-the-hood tasks to speed up the development process. In particular, I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop the front end while using Meteor's MongoDB for logging user information to the database.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges I ran into this weekend was saving user profiles to MongoDB. At first, I attempted to solve the issue by creating a new collection and limiting it's permissions with meteor's publish and subscribe integrations. I attempted to tackle the database with this method for a couple of hours, but with help from fellow mentors, saw that I could just add a profile object to the Meteor.users collection and retrieve the users information from there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At Massey Hacks II, I definitely got a good crash course of meteor with templates, routing, user accounts, and databases. The hackathon also helped me apply my knowledge of objects and arrays with Javascript.

                    What's next for socialhub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because I was working solo for this project, I was only able to complete the front end, and barely making MongoDB workable. Next steps for socialhub are:
                </p>
                <p>
                    &bull; develop mobile applications (both android and ios)
                </p>
                <p>
                    &bull; integrate unique links for user's so they can share their socialhub profiles
                </p>
                <p>
                    &bull; create some sort of option to have a professional page, and a friends/family page (for example, with the professional page, users will only want to add their email, github, and linkedin instead of facebook, twitter, instagram, etc)
                </p>
