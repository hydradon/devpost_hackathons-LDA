                    Making flash card review interpersonal instead of individual.

                    We have 8 decks (currently) based around Computer Science education keywords.  Players select a deck, and one player puts the phone in front of them/against their forehead so they are not in a position to see the screen.  It is the other player's job to describe the term on the screen.  Players may flip down if the guess the word correct, or flip up to skip.

                    We built this app using Java and Android Studio.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We needed to use the phone's accelerometer to determine when it had been flipped forward or backward, and we struggled to form a coordinate axis that responded to players' movements while not being too sensitive.  We also used multiple screens to describe "Success," "Finished," "Time's Up," and "Skip," and were challenged to figure out how each screen would interact with the others in terms of visibility/disappearance at key moments.

                    To be honest, this was our first hackathon for all of us so we're just glad to have finished!

                    How to integrate various java classes and libraries and use the Sensor class to access and monitor the phone's accelerometer.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    If we continue with Rote, we want to add the capability to allow players to build their own deck.  We definitely see this app as being practical to the education field, so giving teachers/students the ability to create their own review keywords would make us more marketable.
