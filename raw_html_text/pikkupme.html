                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app focusses on connecting students so they can share rides to the grocery store or airport(for examples). There was an actual need for this at the buses went to the grocery store only on weekends and there were no good public transport facilities to the airport. I have seen a lot of students asking to share a ride to the airport on facebook and whatsapp groups. Thats why we set out to develop a reliable and safe solution to the same.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If a student is driving to the grocery store or the airport or any other place, then the student posts that on the webpage. When a students posts a ride request for the same, the algorithm does some magic and matches students with rides and notifies them.
