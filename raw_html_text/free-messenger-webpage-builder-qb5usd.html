                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thousands of family-owned, immigrant-opened small businesses heavily rely on Facebook for advertising, staffing, and marketing to attain a stable revenue stream. For older business owners who are not technologically savvy or whose english is not their first language, they cannot contract someone to build their website or have a hard time using services like Wix or Wordpress.

                    The Messenger bot opens up upon the creation of a new Facebook page and talks to the creator asking if the creator would like to create an external webpage for their business. The chat is very simple and is offered in multiple languages to cater to those whose english is not their first language. The user fills in information which is dynamically added to an external webpage supported by a free Github page, making it free for the user. Upon completion of building the website, the user can open the chat for the option to edit the website.
