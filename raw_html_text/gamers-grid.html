                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired gamers who want to be involved in more interactive activities with gaming. We want to build a stronger local community long with a platform that acts as the central hub for all social media in gaming. We felt that most social networks lacked the fixation on gaming and we wanted to contributed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The platform enables you to advertise your self or your service so that other players can notice you. It's another outlet for gamers to unite, compete and socialize. The website allows you to have your own unique profile that will reflect who you are and what you do. You can list yourself as a free agent looking for a team, or a user looking to enjoy LAN parties. You can also advertise yourself as a host and allow users to compete under your event. By organizing your events/tournaments through the platform you can build prestige to become a reputable host.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javasript/Node.js and HTML5 to build components of a social network such as logging in and registering. From there we built a firebase to control the events and users. We then utilized gaming utilize such as twitch api to stream their video feed and chat room. We organized the framework using bootstrap than gave it flare using Javascript and html5. We utilized w3school for some of their classes and built a structure for some of the images on the dashboard. We basically utilized all these different apis to build a resume/profile for each user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The issue we mainly ran into was utilizing apis that were either broken or discontinued. For example we had an idea using the rift api and then we were told that the api is unfinished and not ready to use. Another challenge we faced was facing the google api- which was relatively new to us. Getting used to the dependencies and how some of the functions worked delayed us. We also lost a member during the night :(.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to accomplish all of our work in 24 hours and make the idea we  had real. The images and streams made the website so much more crisp. We are super proud to be able to utilize the api and learn how it functions for continuous use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is important to have control of version control. We knew how to use github, but at times we didnt communicate when we were controlling the same filed - which caused merging issues. We also learned to remain in the scope and make sure that we focus on the end-user overall.
                </p>
