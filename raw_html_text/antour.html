                    This is a unique solution that has a lot of potential to grow into other industries, including Tourism. It is a platform to consolidate information about traveling. You don't have to jump between different services like Yelp and Google Maps.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    First time using APIs and first time hackathon. It was fun accomplishing a project. We learned that the UI is important in helping guide the idea to a prototype.
