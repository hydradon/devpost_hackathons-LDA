                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In medically under-served areas/countries, there is an extreme shortage of CT scanners which are essential for all sorts of diagnoses and for surgical planning. X-ray machines, however, are already available across almost all areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We therefore address this humongous gap of resources on medical imaging by creating a software which would reconstruct and display the 3D structures from just a few plain film radiographs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Matlab codes, Open Source CT images, medical knowledge, oh, and, with PASSION!
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                    Being able to compress everything into 36 hrs is crazy!

                    We will spin it off as a start-up :)
