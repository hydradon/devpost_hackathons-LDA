                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spotify is a great way to listen to and manage music. We regularly find the tools for creating playlists are lacking. For example cloning playlists, batch adding albums to playlists, removing a song from all of your playlists and many other features.

                    Duckify adds functionality to Spotify, focussing on larger operations on playlists. Features:

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back-end is a Django server, which makes use of
                    <a href="https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.7.0" rel="nofollow">
                        Spotipy
                    </a>
                    - a python wrapper for the Spotify API. It provides JSON endpoints for a Vue.js frontend, which handles the front-end pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking front-end to back-end, and authentication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looks good (mimics Spotify's aesthetic) and the features we were most interested in work. We managed to override Bootstrap's standard colours and styles to make the UI more consistent with Spotify.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Authentication is hard. Django and Vue.js should not be in the same project.
                </p>

                    What's next for Duckify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us are interested in refining and expanding this collection of tools, though this will likely include a re-write from the ground up using what we have learned.
