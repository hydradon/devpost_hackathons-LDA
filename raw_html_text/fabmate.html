                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard for us as none of us were knowing android. But yes we tried our best in 24 hours.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot. Like how to work in group, caring about people around and many more. The best thing I learned is think and try to achieve it.

                    What's next for fabmate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to achieve all the functionality because of time limit. We will be adding popups that will be generated for famous places around and also sound system that will speak name of places. It can easily be used by blind people.
