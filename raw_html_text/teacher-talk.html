                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Talking to people in positions of authority about bullying or mental health problems can be difficult and stressful; anonymity can lessen the difficulty of having such conversations.  By allowing a student to remain anonymous while talking to an adult that they trust, perhaps the student can receive whatever help they need without fear of being stigmatized based upon the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teacher Talk allows students to chat with teachers or other school faculty members anonymously; this anonymity can be removed if a faculty member flags a message as indicating that the student may be a danger to him- or herself or others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the code was written on CodePen and then transferred to files on GitHub; from there, files were rearranged and pages were built using Jekyll.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All but one member had very little experience with writing code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If this project were to go into production, security would be an important issue and privacy concerns would need to be addressed more thoroughly.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Day 2 All Stars placed in the semi-finalist round of cup stacking and wrote almost all of the CSS; they did not expect to be able to write as much code as they did.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Not Day 2 All Stars wrote the majority of the HTML and one did all of the Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CSS is painful.  Jekyll does not like to update from GitHub very quickly.  So many things.
                </p>

                    Full implementation of the features devised so far would be nice.
