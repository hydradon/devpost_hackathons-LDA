                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want an alarm that gets me out of bed to turn it off, simple and effective. What most alarms are: LOUD. Loud doesn't work when I live with two roommates. What wakes me up: my phone. It vibrates and has a soft alarm to wake up to -- perfect! -- except my sleepy self is too clever. Its far too easy to simply turn off such an alarm and go back to sleep. Some apps provide puzzles and mental math challenges to simulate the brain for a good morning -- again, my sleepy self is quite the master at solving puzzles if it means getting more sleep. I needed a solution.

                <p>
                    This is a proof of concept on an app that runs on iOS and Android -- an alarm that can only be turned off by interfacing with a desktop (making you get out of bed!) while keeping the same vibration and soft sounds of a mobile phone.

                <p>
                    Using node.js to host the time server, the app is able to receive when to sound and turn off the alarm. Yet, the app is unable to turn off the alarm itself. Being unable to
