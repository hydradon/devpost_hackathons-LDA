                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all too familiar with the uncertainty that comes with each semester.
Which of my subjects are most useful? Which will be back-breaking? Which textbooks do I really need?
In our experience, these are questions best answered by the students who have taken the course. With RateMyCourse, our goal is to facilitate open, honest and constructive conversations about university courses. This will allow prospective students to make better informed decisions about the courses they take.
                </p>

                    Rate My Course does the following

                        Students can search for their university and courses - then view aggregated statistics from user submitted reviews

                    <li>
                        Students can also contribute their own feedback in a standardised form

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started our project by selecting a target audience we wanted to create a solution for - students.
We brainstormed common problems students face and identified the ones we and our peers related to the most.
Once we selected our idea, we put together a solution and broke down its requirements. Low-fidelity wireframes were created using whiteboards, before high-fidelity wireframes were created using Invisionapp and Photoshop.
To scaffold our project, we used dotnet, built it with Visual Studio Code and used GitHub to enable us to collaborate seamlessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was definitely our largest obstacle during the Hackathon. Our design process was extremely productive, however we soon faced considerable difficulty in selecting the optimal framework and scaffolding solution to get something up and running. 
Dotnet compatibility across older platforms was also certainly an issue which rendered a team member&rsquo;s device unusable for development. This was addressed promptly and effectively by implementing pair programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use dotnet and successfully modifying some of the pre-generated code is something we are proud of.
We are also proud of how we worked as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from learning about dotnet, we learnt more about collaborating on GitHub - the issues we can often come across and how to resolve them.
