                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been to several road trips and came to know there were different laws in different states which we were unaware of. Drive mate is an idea where the driver gets notification of the necessary traffics laws throughout the journey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we travel through different states it provides necessary notifications of traffic laws to the diver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used google map API for location tracking, android studio for app development, and visited different websites for the traffic laws and information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a new experience for all of us. We researched in android development for some ample amount of time and started app development alongside. Came across with a lot of errors and the limited time pressure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build an android app for the first time, we were able to create a general layout of the world map with an option to access the exact GPS location of certain place through their coordinates. User was able to select the state they wanted and get traffic laws of that particular state through push notification.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to work with android studio for the first time. Learn different aspects of app development as this was one of the biggest challenges for our team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Drive Mate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A fully developed app for various mobile platforms like android, IOS, windows. For future versions, we are looking forward to adding features like, live traffic updates, efficient detour options, warnings for hazardous weather/road conditions, and options of carpooling.
