                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use to be a fine arts major and I decided to fuse both worlds
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes pictures from your camera and tries to create a pixel art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Java and OpenCV
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was unable to properly change the hues, tints, and saturation of all the individual pictures that were suppose to mimic pixels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to tackle this assignment. Though I am not finished I enjoyed the experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use OpenCV for Java and a lot more about Java's graphics and color library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pixel Art
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The real vision of this game is for it to be a mobile app that keeps track of memories by making colleges of your vacations and any other sudden burst of camera activity.
