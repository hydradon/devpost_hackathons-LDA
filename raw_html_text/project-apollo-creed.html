                    <strong>
                        The Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    We wanted a fun and engaging way to get people to work out an connect and we immediately thought of one of our favorite movies, Rocky. Boxing is a very athletic sport and sparring helps two people connect with one another but the physical pain is a deterrent to many. That's why we started Project Apollo Creed, named after a famous Rocky opponent, to create a form of boxing that doesn't require contact.

                    <strong>
                        The Technology
                    </strong>
                    The first thing we thought about was how to efficiently mimic a boxer's moves with hardware and we realized that the Myo comes with an on board gyroscope, as well as accelerometer. We wanted to use four myo's, two each for two people, but we found that you can't connect more than three myo's to one computer, which is what led us to our next tech decision, using Node. Node.js is an extremely powerful server language that helps us connect two laptops and Node also has great libraries to interface with the myo's sensors. So we set up a client side node program to be used by any user while we set up a server side to which the users will connect to. As for health, we also used calculations to estimate how many calories a person burns using our product, which will be explained in the next section.

                    <strong>
                        Health
                    </strong>
                    Boxing is a very movement intensive sport so capturing the calories burned was tough so we estimated using common knowledge. When punching with the myo, we calculate the damage dealt using acceleration of the punch so we could understand the kinetic energy spent in one punch, (v^2*m)/2. The v is velocity which we get from the myo, the m is the mass which ask from our user. Using this information, we get the amount of energy expended in joules which we convert into calories but now there is just one missing factor in our equation, the human factor. We needed a benchmark to compare our results with so we used the fact that one push-up is worth one calorie to estimate that a really strong man could do 50 push-ups a minute, therefore he could burn 50 calories in one minute. Since one punch is only moving about one-third of our body's mass, we estimate that a really strong person could lose 15 calories in one minute of boxing. In our tests, the highest score achieved by a high school student was 8000 in our damage scale so we assumed a well built man could get about 15,000. Using these numbers we ended up with an equation that just had one last variable, the human efficiency loss. After calculating for that, we tested my weight against this model and I could theoretically burn 7 calories. There is a rule of thumb in many healthy living site that in a boxing workout, you would lose 2.72 calories per pound per hour of work.With my weight and spending one minute of work, that rule of thumb theoretically yields me burning 7.25 calories, only .25 away from our calculation meaning our efficiency factor is plausible. THAT is how we figured out how many calories are lost using just myo's and common knowledge.
