                    Inspiration I was originally going to make a tower defense game, but my group mates wanted to use Eclipse. So, I decided to make my own tower defense game. However, that was a little too daunting &amp; when I was trying to make the grid for the tower defense game, I forgot to remove gravity from the grids, so they all fell down &amp; I decided to make a fun, simple game.

                    What it does It's supposed to entertain &amp; amuse everyone who plays it, like all video games, while providing a moderate challenge to reaction times.

                    How I built it I used Unity &amp; C# all on my own to make it.

                    Challenges I ran into More than I can think of. One things that sticks out is horribly inefficient way I interact between classes. After hours of trying, I finally found a way to loop through every object in the game &amp; just to pick out one by tag. Too bad I didn't have any group members to help!

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of Doing it all by myself, it's really satisfying to know how everything works &amp; that you did it all. This is also my second game I've ever submitted anywhere, so there's that.

                    What I learned I learned I work best by myself, mostly, &amp; lots of stuff about coding, GUIs, Collision Detection, etc.. For example, I learned that collision between two Rigid Bodies doesn't work when one is translated into the other.

                    What's next for Knocky Down I'm not planning any further development, although there are some things I didn't have time to add. I'll probably show it to some future employers as a record of my attendance here &amp; keep it so I can look back at it when I'm older.
