                    Everybody knows how awefully long car trips without proper entertainment can be.
You're driving past hundreds of cities, but most of the time you don't know anything about
their secret stories - even when they lie on your daily commute!

                    With only one Tap DriveBy starts telling you the most interesting facts about the places
you pass by. Completly hands-free you can get entertaining info about cities, architecture, nature and much more.
Powered with the vast knowledge of Wikipedia you will never hear the same fact twice!
You can even use it in public transport or just for a stroll around a new city.
Enough words - just try it yourself; No Account needed!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've build an Android app which uses only geolocation and an internet connection to orchestrate
information retrieval from wikipedias api, processing the data into fitting chunks of information and
reading them out to the user in the fitting situation via TextToSpeech Technology.
The app also uses Realm Database as persistent storage to reduce mobile data usage via caching. 
There is even an graphical user interface which consists of heads-up notifications while traveling
and a list of all places with corresponding links to Wikipedia is available for checking back after the
ride.
