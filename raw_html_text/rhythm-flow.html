                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I recently got attached to Beat Saber so I thought I'd be fun to build something similar to it.

                    Objective
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The objective of the game is to score higher than your opponent. Points are scored if a player triggers a hitbox when a note is in contact with it.

                    Combos are achieved when a hitbox triggered

                    more than once in a row. Combos add a great amount of bonus to your score and progressively increase in value as the pace of the notes progress.

                        Support for tablets. The game is very much playable on the computer but the mechanics of it can also be ported to tablets where the touch screen size is sufficient enough to use controls.

                        More game modes. Currently, there is only one game mode where two people are directly competing against each other. I have ideas for other games modes where instead of competing, two players would have collaborate together to beat the round.
