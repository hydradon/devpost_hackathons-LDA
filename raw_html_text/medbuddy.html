                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Atleast once in their life, everyone forgets to take their prescribed pills. For people with smartphones, there a plenty of apps, helping you to keep track of your medication&acute;. We needed a special pogram that
                </p>
                <p>
                    Seniors without a smartphone, have a
                    <strong>
                        hard time to keep track of their prescribed drugs
                    </strong>
                    . Especially as they often rake several pills at multiple times a day**. Even for seniors with a good memory, it can be very challenging to take all their pillall at the right time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we aimed to build a device for elderly people, which
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        helps remind people to take their medication
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        it is handicap accessible (voice activation)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        and is intuitive to use.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    To make sure that seniors can use this devices as long as possible, we
                    <strong>
                        avoided any filigree tactile interaction
                    </strong>
                    (shaking hands) and small
                    <strong>
                        displays
                    </strong>
                    (loss of sight),
                    <strong>
                        by using the Amazon Alexa-platform
                    </strong>
                    , which is purely based on verbal interaction. We put a
                    <strong>
                        strong focus on the intuitive interface
                    </strong>
                    of the device. It is a clear step-by-step interface (see image), where in every step you get the possibility to ask for help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa tells you when and what pill you should take, like
                    <strong>
                        an alarm clock for pills
                    </strong>
                    . The information is based on the data you gave to Alexa (speech based). It can also generate a report, about when you forgot to take your pills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interface Workflow (see also picture representation above):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        During the first setup medBuddy asks you for your current prescriptions (name, quantity and frequency) and the next appointment with your doctor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every time you need to take a pill, Alexa reminds you of taking it by speaking to you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You than have the possibility to take your pill right away or postpone the taking for 15 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alexa asks you for a confirmation whether you took your pill.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One day before your appointment with the doctor, Alexa can give you a report of when you took your pills and when you missed it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the appointment Alexa will ask you for your next appointment with your doctor and if there where any changes in your prescription.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Amazon Echo with the Alexa skill kit in combination with AWS lambda function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For triggering the Alexa (see challenges) we used the RaspberryPi connected to a mongodb database. Which we synchronize with the data of the Alexa environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encounter that Alexa does not (yet) support actions triggered by a timer or an external signal. So we had to engineer our own solution to this problem. We used a Rasberry Pi, which talks to Alexa to activate it. This made the project much more complex then expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the first basic interaction (MVP)** with the user for our idea and created a device which tackles a serious problem of elderly people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out how to use the Alexa environment and learned about the (current) limitations.
                </p>

                        Once Amazon introduced the time-triggered-action (already announced), we can
                        <strong>
                            get rid of the additional Raspberry Pi
                        </strong>
                        , which makes the app cheaper and easy to distribute.
