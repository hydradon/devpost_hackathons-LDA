                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have been looking for houses. When I add open houses to my Google Calendar, I am able to request direction to whatever house is open next in time, but I was thinking&hellip;
&ldquo;What if two houses are significantly far apart, open at similar times, and there are other houses in each of their respective neighborhoods that open at different times? Is there a way I can plan my day of house hunting so that I can attend all of the open houses?&rdquo;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app allows the users to search for open houses based on personal preferences and by date and location and optimizes a route that maximizes the amount of open houses that they can visit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML , CSS, and Javascript for the web application. For the route optimization by location and directions, we used the ESRI ArcGIS Javascript API. We also tried to the use the ArcGIS Python API to develop a function that could optimize routes by location and based on open times.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we were unable to get the map to print out directions. However, we were able to find a method that could print out the street names of the route.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of and What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize the ESRI ArcGIS API using both Javascript and Python. We learned a lot about UI principles and concepts.
