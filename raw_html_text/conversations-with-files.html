                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front End in Managed File Transfer Software (MFT) is based in the same operative and same windows, I think that using a bot can be more interactive with the user and including Alexa could be more attractive for the MFT users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NativeChat can call API and MoveIt provides an API which enables you to develop, integrate, and deploy secure file transfer and management applications

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will discover which conversations can be useful to users in order to help them to manage files and operations into Move.It.  The challenges are to change the rules of how now the users are interacted with files and have a nice assistant front-end using a chat bot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had trouble debugging the  APIs for file uploads.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    NativeChat, build conversations, play with Alexa Developer Environment connecting with NativeChat.
