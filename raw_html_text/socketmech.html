                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a game that can be enjoyed no matter how many people want to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SocketMech is a game that is supposed to use a java socket server to connect phones to a master computer. The master computer will be immersed in an oculus rift and is able to destroy towns that the phone users are building.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity3D we developed the game play and client side server handling. In Eclipse we created the framework for a multithreaded java socket server. We also utilized the oculus rift along with x-keys to create an immersive experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first goal was to establish the java socket server, but soon realize it was a more daunting task then we first imagined. We ended up having to push it off to develop gameplay. Later we drew out and started coding a better model for the server, which should work in theory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first game using VR, and it's pretty amazing to see our creation up close and personal. Jeff's 3D modeling ability grew fast from new to experienced, which is shown in the timeline of models created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't bite off more than you can chew, but don't be afraid to try. We also learned a LOT about java socket servers and multithreading. This is also our first time creating a game in VR, and absolutely loved it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SocketMech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finish developing the server! Once the server is responsive, we will go ahead with managing it clientside between the app and desktop. Eventually being the full realized game we initially imagined.
