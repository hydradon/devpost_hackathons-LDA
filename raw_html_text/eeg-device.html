                <p>
                    we were trying to hack the EEG monitor lead wires (used for medical equipment).  We wanted to help out people who were disable people as in they cant use their hands and for people who want to use something else than their hands for games like virtual realities or any 2d games.

                    Determine signals and making a simulation to determine those signals that we are capturing.
