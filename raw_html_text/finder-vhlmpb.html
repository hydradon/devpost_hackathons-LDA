                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have had several friends who have lost things, and because of that, they spent countless days searching the lost and found. With our app, students will know beforehand whether or not their items are in the lost and found, therefore eliminating the need to keep making pointless trips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows the administration to be able to be able to take pictures of items in the lost and found and then upload them. In addition, the administration can also remove images when a student claims a lost item. Finally, our app also provides a way for students and parents to view these images of lost items, which are organized by category.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Android Studio, and used nested layouts in order to create the display. We also added Firebase, which was able to add as well as retrieve and remove images. However we didn't have enough time to connect it with the retrieval of images. We finally also used a camera API for the administration to be able to access the camera-roll and take pictures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges that we ran into were Gradle and Build errors, especially with the Firebase.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishments that I, Swetha, and Neeraja are proud of was getting the login to work, as well as also being able to implement Firebase to hold image uris and other information about the image. Even though we didn't have enough time to add the implement Firebase to our code, through this, we learned a lot about databases. Finally, we are also proud about learning XML, which we used to create nested layouts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with databases, mainly firebase, nested layouts, and Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next for Finder is being able to connect the implemented Firebase with the rest of our code to be able to add and remove an unlimited number of images more efficiently. In addition, we also plan on automating our layout tiles.
