                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Earlier this year, I started learning more about image and video processing which later led me to start developing mobile software that uses computer vision (image &amp; video processing are parts of CV) techniques to place 2D and 3D graphics in real world space through the camera, also know as augmenting reality (AR).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later in June of this year, Apple announced ARKit&ndash;an easy-to-use framework that enables iOS developers to place 3D &amp; 2D objects in the real world space through the phone camera. I decided to start using it since the framework allowed me to be more productive as a developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, there was one big issue developers and I faced while using ARKit, and it was the ability to record videos with augmented reality components (retrieving fully rendered frames/buffers). Developers started using alternatives such as
                    <em>
                        screen recording
                    </em>
                    and
                    <em>
                        screenshots
                    </em>
                    in order to record and capture media content with augmented reality components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I decided to use my backgrounds and knowledge in image &amp; video processing to fix that issue by building an easy-to-use framework that enable developers capture and record ARKit videos, photos, Live Photos and GIFs; and I called it
                    <em>
                        ARVideoKit
                    </em>
                    .

                    has received so much attention and 100s of developers started using it in the iOS community since I published it last week (November 5th, 2017).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The amazing feedback from developers motivated me to build something
                    <strong>

                    Currently Facebook is the best platform for

                    </strong>
                    has even a bigger potential to be a platform that enables mobile gamers to

                        share their gaming experience

                <p>
                    Augmented reality has been a trend recently; yet, we're still in the early stages of developing fully interactive experiences in augmented reality. Furthermore, users LOVE sharing their funny experiences while using augmented reality features
