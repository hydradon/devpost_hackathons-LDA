                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many times, we just don't know what to do! We have free time on our hands, but the only problem we are having is just what exactly what we want to do! So we thought to ourselves, why not develop a program that assists you with that? How can we link you to the possible entertainments that you will be interested in?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this program, "Are You Bored?", it tries to give you all the possible interests that you would like. After inputting their location and selecting a category: food, movies, or entertainment, the program will produce results for points of interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Are you bored?" is built entirely through Python. All the graphics and code are made originally by ourselves. We utilized Photoshop, Google's API base, and Python Dictionary.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to do a hack using Amazon Echo. However, we ran into a number of problems. None of our team members have worked with Amazon Echo before and as a result, we could not understand the coding behind Amazon Echo. Through our inability to grasp the overall code, we were unable to implement the idea that we originally had: a medical program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the first time that our whole group has worked with APIs. However, we ran into many coding issues implementing the Google Places API so that it functioned smoothly in our program. Every process seemed to be a problem for us. From finding the APIs to printing the result, we had to work through each component tirelessly in order to produce a clean program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dictionaries, APIs, modules were all ideas that were very foreign to our group. We've never worked with them before. However, we were determined to use them within our project. And we did! So our whole group is proud of collaborating together to implement these ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For me, (Paul Yang), as a student heading into the major of Business. I had zero experience within coding. It was especially difficult for me to catch up with my group members, who had a lot more experience than me. The workshops seemed very fast for me and it all seemed to have a steep learning curve. However, through the experience of this Hackathon, this is opened my eyes for my interest in coding and how critical it is for the many technologies that we have in our life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bored?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bored has a very simple interface. The user inputs their location and the program will produce results on their interest. It's very easy to expand from our base code. There are a multitude of opportunities for Bored. A rating system for the places they visit, an algorithm based on their interests, and more options for entertainments, are all examples of these.
