                    Many people who have depression have issues with properly addressing it. To ease this burden, we have created ReadMe. ReadMe is an android app that analyzes users' messaging patterns. It parses those messages, and determines the general mood of a user, displaying it to themselves and to their contacts. This allows the users to better determine what to say to each other and when is the most appropriate time to do so. The main purpose of the app is to help seamlessly uncover depression in users who might not be able to admit it to themselves. It is also designed to notify a user's contacts as to when the user might be facing some issues.
