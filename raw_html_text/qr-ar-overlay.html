                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Idea on the fly at half 10 this morning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The camera scans a qr code and embeds an image of the related website over the top of the camera image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OpenCV, Awesomium and lots of coffee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a live browser to be embedded over the top of the camera image. We also wanted the embedded page to have a three 3D effect moving with the user. These became unobtainable due to time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learnt how to install and begin to understand Linux, while another member has now been converted to Linux.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waiting for technology to catch up. Implementation of above ideas and hololens technology.
