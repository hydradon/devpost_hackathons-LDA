                <p>
                    Within the past few months, the United States has been impacted with several natural disasters such as Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and the storm that hit Puerto Rico. In fact, the South Bay was affected by a major flood that resulted in millions of dollars in property damage and several injuries. Many families and individuals in the end suffer the consequences of mother nature looking for a way to rebuild from the storms. Fortunately, the rest of the country shows its support through crowdfunding and relief support services such as the Red cross.

                    However, not all families and individuals know about these services or some might not be able to reach them in time. So how can we resolve this issue and bring attention to the services these victims have the rights to access? We introduce Spartan Package, a native application run by Expo to generate an interpretation of the client&rsquo;s surroundings via Microsoft Azure Computer Vision functions. The analysis with connection to Google Cloud Platform&rsquo;s maps API will provide a list of property damage costs, financial compensation from insurance, and local relief support.

                    A spartan head generated by AR will assist the user with the Cisco Spark chatbot and act as the interface and the services they are entitled to. The spartan will list all of the services depending on where the user points their camera and the computer vision API will interpret the costs from there.
