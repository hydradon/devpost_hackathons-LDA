                    So what's the problem?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Think about the last time you went to a baseball park. How many fans around you were completely focused on the game, pitch after pitch? Odds are, not many. Instead, it's normal to see their attention drawn to food, phones, and friends. And there's nothing wrong with that. We just want to add a bit more excitement to the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea first came about from our frustrations with redeeming rewards at sporting events (e.g. remembering to save your ticket stub for that free quarter pounder at McDonald's). But there are obvious economic reasons why such redemptions are difficult. So we set out to build an experience which engages fans and rewards them for their continued involvement. LiveChoice brings the live ballpark experience to those phones which take away so many fans' attention during the game.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game is a rewards based system where users can guess what the person at-bat will accomplish (Ex. Single, Strikeout, Home Run). For example, Jason Kipnis is on deck. You open LiveChoice and click on Jason Kipnis. You believe he's gonna hit a homer. So you click home run.  Then you wait. Jason Kipnis steps up to plate, and cracks one into deep left field. it's going, going, GONE!! Yay! You were right. You are now rewarded with a certain amount of points based on the odds of a home run happening. If, however, Kipnis gets up there and grounds out to shortstop, then you get nothing. These points can be exchanged for various prizes including discounted food and merchandise to free rewards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Points will be deducted on purchase of an item and the user can redeem their item at a POS system at the event.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using React Native, a universal coding language built by FaceBook, which allows us to code in one language and compile/run the application on both iOS and Android. React Native allows us to write modular code which allows for better collaboration with components and source control. It also gave us the option of developing on multiple platforms with a one codebase. 
For our back end, we are using FireBase. FireBase allowed for us to set up a quick and easy back end environment to accelerate our front end development. 
GitHub is where we are storing our code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are using the same official MLB live feed that their official game day application to update our game statistics.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial challenge was agreeing on a unified design pattern. We also had to learn as a group how to use React Native and its many challenges due to being a work in progress (Ex. Outdated Documentation, limited documentation, etc.). 
Conflicts work schedules and personal lives proved to also be a challenge.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a fully functioning application in 2 weeks while learning a brand new platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React Native and Mobile Development - We improved our knowledge of coding inside of React Native. As we continue to improve coding in React Native, we will be able to develop more complex applications for both iOS and Android.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Team building - We were able to successfully work as a team with little conflict. A lot of great ideas came out of collaboration as a team which ended up making their way into the application.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will continue to polish the application and developing our skills. Hopefully in the future we will have an offer extended to us.
