                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone experiences times of doubt. Before knowledge comes fear fo the unknown. We wanted to help those struggling with mental health by showing them that they can come out on top.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is not limited to its nascent scope. It connects individuals who are doubtful or anxious over some event in the future with those who have already had the experience. We created a platform for people to become mentors, mentees, or both. We enable direct, one-on-one conversations between mentors and mentees, where the mentor shares their experience in getting through a difficult year, in managing a humongous workload, in being forced to eat unique foods, or whatever else the mentee may be mentally struggling over.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the backend using Python, and connected it to the javascript/html/css frontend using Tornado.
