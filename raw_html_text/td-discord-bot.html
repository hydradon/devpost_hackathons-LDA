                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use the Da Vinci TD API, and integrate it into a popular existing platform. One of the challenges with conventional bank apps is their inconvenience and generally bad user experience. Similar to the messaging platform WeChat, we wanted to make sending money as easy as sending a message to a friend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Discord bot that interfaces with the Da Vinci TD API, allowing you to make transfers. You can create an "account" with the bot, which stores your account ID, allowing you to send money to any other member of the server that also has a registered account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bot will DM you to register your account and check your balance, meaning greater privacy.
                </p>
                <p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python exclusively to access the APIs and create command for a Discord bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know how to use APIs, and had to relearn Python. We also had to learn how to use and create a discord bot from scratch. Overall, most of our time was spent learning, understanding and using many different tools and softwares we have never even heard of in order to create the most efficient bot for our program.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Learning how to use bot interactions in the discord client in order to have our bot output and return different responses

                    <li>
                        We accomplished successful usage of the two API's, the discord API and the TD API
