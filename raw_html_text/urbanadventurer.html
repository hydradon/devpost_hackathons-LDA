                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that we as individuals generally dislike going in tour groups over individual exploration. Tour groups and tour guides always feel rushed, and when you're going alone, you can go at your own pace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To solve this problem, we created an app where people are able to create custom tour experiences and share them online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web app using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We implemented the Google Maps API and the Google Directions API with Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a few setbacks because we attempted to use programming languages (cough Swift) and environments we were unfamiliar with at first. Ideally, we want this app to be fully mobile compatible, since people will most likely be using their phones when going on these tours. However, we lacked the development skills in order to implement it on the mobile platform, so we stuck with a web app instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to piece together a workable product on an extremely short time crunch. Although it's not perfect, we're proud of the design of our website on most pages, and we think a new user would be quite drawn in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that if you want to rapidly prototype and start developing immediately, it's best to build off of what you know first. Depth over breadth worked out in this case. We also learned how to implement a few Google APIs in the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UrbanAdventurer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UrbanAdventurer is the kind of app that would work best on mobile device, so we would want to port it over to iOS and Android devices. We would also use PHP to store the information we get from the "Create a Tour" page to a server, so we can make our City pages have a list of online tour submissions. We also want to refine our page designs and section designs so that the app looks better overall. Finally, we want to expand on the features of UrbanAdventurer. We would include features such as rating others' tours, estimated tour times, and estimated prices. To encourage people to continue using our app, we could introduce an Elite UrbanAdventurer title, where the heaviest users/users with the most good tours will get invited to exclusive events for free, much like Elite Yelpers do.
