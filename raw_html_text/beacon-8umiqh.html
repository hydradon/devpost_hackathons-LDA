                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technology has shaped the job market in numerous ways but the most notable impact technology has had on the job market is reliance on technology more than humans which has ultimately led to a loss of job for many people.
Beacon aims at creating jobs by bringing in an ecosystem of never ending supply and demand for job.
