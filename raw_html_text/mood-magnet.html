                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members know Clinical Psychology PhDs who complain about the current state of telemental health and the need for solutions that are built for clinical use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to enter their mood daily in the app and stores in the database and allows the psychologist to access data from their many patients on the computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Firebase for the database, Java/Android Studio for the mobile app, HTML/JavaScript for the web app (psychologist's version).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble getting the database to load on the phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully uploaded data to the database. We are also proud of the animations in the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding is hard
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mood Magnet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want psychologists to be able to change the moods available to their patient based on customization . Once cleaning up the app, it would be interesting to test it out with real patients. We surprisingly even have several clinicians who already agreed to try the device after going to them for brainstorming.
