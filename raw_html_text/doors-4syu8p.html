                    We were trying our best to be a little creative and have an interactive game that's simple enough to make, because all of us are not very experienced when it comes to coding, especially java, but we wanted to learn so we decided to try it out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The gist is the in the game (which we were planning to have in first person point of view), the player is trapped in a maze and needs to get out to live. But the player constantly runs into two doors at a time and needs to choose one door---one riddle---to move on. Each door is accompanied by a riddle and the player is allowed to choose which riddle to answer. If the player answers correctly, they move on in the maze. If not, they meet a certain fate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few challenges we ran into and we're still stuck in is getting the user to simply press 'enter' to move on in the game, but we figured that part out. The current issue is incorporating every option effectively into the program, but we were unable to fix the errors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use 'try and catch' methods, using 'enter' to move on in the game (which we found out was simply "input.nextLine();", and using text files so all the riddles and answers aren't in a single file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for our project is fixing the errors and incorporating the images we drew into our game. We want to make the game visually appealing and interesting as well, so that's another goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game/code itself is not finished, but we are planning to finish it soon.
