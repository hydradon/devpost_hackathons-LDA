                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every project aims to solve a problem, and to solve people's concerns. When we walk into a restaurant, we are so concerned that not many photos are printed on the menu. However, we are always eager to find out what a food looks like. Surprisingly, including a nice-looking picture alongside a food item increases sells by 30% according to Rapp. So it's a big inconvenience for customers if they don't understand the name of a food. This is what we are aiming for! This is where we get into the field! We want to create a better impression on every customer and create a better customer-friendly restaurant society. We want every person to immediately know what they like to eat and the first impression of a specific food in a restaurant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly used ARKit, MVC and various APIs to build this iOS app. We first start with entering an AR session, and then we crop the image programmatically to feed it to OCR from Microsoft Azure Cognitive Service. It recognized the text from the image, though not perfectly. We then feed the recognized text to a Spell Check from Azure to further improve the quality of the text. Next, we used Azure Image Search service to look up the dish image from Bing, and then we used Alamofire and SwiftyJSON for getting the image. We created a virtual card using SceneKit and place it above the menu in ARView. We used Firebase as backend database and for authentication. We built some interactions between the virtual card and users so that users could see more information about the ordered dishes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into various unexpected challenges when developing Augmented Reality and using APIs. First, there are very few documentations about how to use Microsoft APIs on iOS apps. We learned how to use the third-party library for building HTTP request and parsing JSON files. Second, we had a really hard time understanding how Augmented Reality works in general, and how to place virtual card within SceneKit. Last, we were challenged to develop the same project as a team! It was the first time each of us was pushed to use Git and Github and we learned so much from branches and version controls.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only learning swift and ios development for one month, we create our very first wonderful AR app. This is a big challenge for us and we still choose a difficult and high-tech field, which should be most proud of. In addition, we implement lots of API and create a lot of "objects" in AR, and they both work perfectly. We also encountered few bugs during development, but we all try to fix them. We're proud of combining some of the most advanced technologies in software such as AR, cognitive services and computer vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the whole development time, we clearly learned how to create our own AR model, what is the structure of the ARScene, and also how to combine different API to achieve our main goal. First of all, we enhance our ability to coding in swift, especially for AR. Creating the objects in AR world teaches us the tree structure in AR, and the relationships among parent nodes and its children nodes. What's more, we get to learn swift deeper, specifically its MVC model. Last but not least, bugs teach us how to solve a problem in a team and how to minimize the probability of buggy code for next time. Most importantly, this hackathon poses the strength of teamwork.

                    What's next for DishPlay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We desire to build more interactions with ARKit, including displaying a collection of dishes on 3D shelf, or cool animations that people can see how those favorite dishes were made. We also want to build a large-scale database for entering comments, ratings or any other related information about dishes! We are happy that Yelp and OpenTable bring us more closed to the restaurants. We are excited about our project because it will bring us more closed to our favorite food!
