                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enjoy Escape Rooms and virtual reality so we wanted to combine the two and have it be reeeaallllyyy spoookyyyyy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scares you, gives you a little motion sickness and allows you to walk around and interact with a few object in our virtual escape room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Oculus DK2 integration tools within Unity to allow the use of the headset. The rest of the game was just made in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all starters in using Unity as well as the Oculus rift so it took about four hours to just get the rift working in Unity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Unity as well as the nuances of coding for the Oculus.
