                    Inspiration:
Often times, people spend a lot of time copying text from another source into their mobile devices
                </p>
                <p>
                    How it works:
We made a custom keyboard. When you press the "camera" icon, it scans a picture you took of some line of texts and insert the text(s) back into your current text field
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it:
We built our app using Xamarin, C#, and the Google Vision API
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into:
Implementing our own custom keyboard, figuring out how to use Google Vision API, dealing with provisional profiles in iOS
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
To get our app working in time. Plus, the returned text results turns out to be pretty accurate!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned
We learned to that you shouldn't give up. We encountered a lot of unexpected bugs and challenges, and started to doubt that we would able to finish, but it all worked out in the end!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for Pic2Text:
We are going to implement our app on iOS and, potentially on Windows and Mac.
