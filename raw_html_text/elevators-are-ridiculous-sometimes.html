                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The elevator next to our office never comes. It's frustrating not knowing where it is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A IoT device that let you know where the elevator is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SoC or MCU mounted in the elevator without modify the elevator circuitry.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No enough equipment to realize.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few conceptual designs + some validation test.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bluetooth signal level can be used to track location and it is pretty robust.
                </p>

                    What's next for Elevators are ridiculous, sometimes

                <p>
                    "Hack" the elevators without hack the elevators
