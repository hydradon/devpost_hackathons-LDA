                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Suicide is one of the leading unsolvable problems in the world today. While the suicide hotline exists and counselors/therapists are there to help people, as a whole, the world still seems to lack at educating its youth about suicide. Through the recent experience of losing a loved one, we&rsquo;ve realized that now is the time to look for a solution that will make an impact. Today, the concept of death and suicide gets thrown around as a joke, and the reality of it is much more horrifying than it is deemed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web-based and phone-based application provide users with a compelling storyline to simulate the current issues we as a society face regarding suicide. The purpose of this storyline is to make users more aware of the effects depression and suicide can have on oneself and others. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, approximately 44,965 individuals die by suicide each year, making it the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. We want to bring more awareness to this idea by utilizing the power of technology and our coding skills to show people that they ultimately have a choice hopefully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each member started coding in a different programming language, with the idea of merging everything in Javascript. But it turned out to be harder than we expected.  To save time and finish our project, we turned to Episode&rsquo;s create your own game feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges that we had run into throughout this project. With our original idea starting off as a standard HTML website with game functionality, we soon ran into trouble with multiple aspects, including combining languages, making a compelling yet realistic storyline on time, making an HTML website with game functionality from scratch. We realized that formulating a story for each possible outcome would be a very long process, which is why we limited to only three questions per user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working as a team to complete the project. We gave our very best effort. Although we encountered problems at the combining language stage, we learned the invaluable lesson to plan ahead, which we can apply to our everyday lives and our careers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned it's important for everybody on the team to code using the same language. This is because when we tried to translate our C++ source code into Javascript, we weren't able to do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LastDay?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to take our idea further by using Machine Learning to gather data from the selected answers and have the game potentially help users based on their scenarios. We want to simulate as many scenarios as possible to make users feel like they are not alone and that they ultimately have a say in this world. We could also partner with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention advocate for the positive effects this game is intended to have on the users who play it.
