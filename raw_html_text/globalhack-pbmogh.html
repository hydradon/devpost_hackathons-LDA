                    Win and I both live in San Francisco, the intersection of old money, new money, and well, no money; the juxtaposition of google buses, multimillion dollar mansions, and tents under the bridge is nearly unfathomable - except we walk by it
                    <strong>
                        every single day
                    </strong>
                    . And we had to do something about it. We realized that although soup kitchens need (and appreciate) all the volunteer work they can get, our less than regular personal contributions were not scalable - there was simply no &lsquo;K-factor&rsquo; for our efforts. Instead, we strived to find a way we could leverage our skill sets to create a scalable and sustainable way to help solve the homeless crisis. GlobalHack was an incredible catalyst for us to
                    <em>
                        actually do something
                    </em>
                    .  We hope that this hackathon
                    <strong>
                        is
                    </strong>
                    the springboard that propels prototypes into sustainable solutions. We&rsquo;re incredibly excited to be a part of this movement, and we hope that we can and
                    <strong>
                        will
                    </strong>
                    and make a true and lasting impact.

                    Our CRM acts as a primary data aggregator and can scale across all your homeless shelters and partnership programs. Resident information can easily be digitally shared between your organizations, enabling end-to-end client management - and collecting exponentially more information about each resident.

                        HMIS data - simplified:
                    </strong>
                    Our basic report functionality is built directly into the platform, allowing you to easily visualize the data your system is collecting. And because we collect data from multiple sources, and will have some of the top mathematicians building your algorithms, we&rsquo;re able to do more with the data you have.

                        Cross-organization collaboration:
                    </strong>
                    Our platform supports peer-to-peer collaboration. Not only will you be able to leverage a pooled data source, but we&rsquo;re also building functionality to allow you to interact with your counterparts directly through the platform. Our goal is to incorporate external data sources and open the platform to third-party developers, who can build even more advanced tools on top of this pooled data.
