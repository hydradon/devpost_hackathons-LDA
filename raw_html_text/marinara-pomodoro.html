                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many were lacking in producitivity and wasting their time on useless things. So, We integrated ML technology with the application so that it automates the process and alerts the user when it notices the movement.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our App notifies the user whether the task has been completed within the given time or not.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Xamarin platform to create the UI and used C# for the functions (Backend). And, The Azure ML cognitive services helps to detect the focus of the user and alerts when he gets out of the focus.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I challenged myself when I tried to connect Azure ML API with our app.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Azure ML for the first time and successfully integrated it with the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use Azure ML and I explored other services of Azure. And, i am going to use it for my future developments.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We train our ML model with more data set.to so that it finds more accurate of the user movements. Also, We try our best to improve our UI/UX experience of the application.
