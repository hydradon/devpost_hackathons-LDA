                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every human was proved that have the mood as 80% of happiness and 20% of distress of all the time. That is where our inspirations come. We care about human's feelings. There is time we should look back and reflect what we have done to head up stronger. With the improving of technology, we build the AI bot to be your friend. It takes care of your emotional, and becomes one of your besties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It analyzes all your Facebook's posts, pictures and gallery in your iPhone to understand you better. The AI bot comes to cheer or crack you up as much as it can to enhance your emotion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the back end side, we fetch all the client's Facebook posts and photos through Facebook Graph API. We use Clarify API to retrieve the details through the images. We combine the keywords of all the images and the all the client's posts from Facebook to predict the status of the user. Through that, the bot comes up and soothe sorrow with the user or share the happiness with the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, our team just has only 2 people, there are a lot of work between us. But luckily we worked it through. We split up the task so that one person do the front end and one do the back end stuff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to also build a chat-bot on iOS by Facebook API that uses AI to converse with the user.
