                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were approached by the Chandler Christian Community Center, which needed a way to engage volunteers, donors, and aid recipients via their mobile devices.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution was twofold: first, we made an app that would be compatible with every Android phone still in use according to Google's statistics. This app would parallel the already existing website and highlight the most important parts, making it easy for people to find what they need. Second, we wrote a list of instructions on how to use Remind, a service that allows sending text messages to large groups of people all at once. This will allow the Chandler Christian Community Center to use its already existing database of phone numbers to reach out to its volunteers and donors in a more efficient manner than email.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Android Studio. This meant coding both in Java and XML.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were numerous challenges that we ran into during the course of this process. As it was our first Hackathon and our first time making an app in Android, we had very little idea of what to do in the beginning. One of the biggest challenges was getting the notification drawer to work properly. Other problems we faced were formatting and optimizing the app at the end.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of the fact that we overcame many obstacles and gave solving the problem our best shot. Before today, none of us had very much idea of how to make an app, and in a little over a day we all learned a lot about the process.

                <p>
                    The next thing to do would be in-app PayPal integration and increased usability (like a truly functional back button and more intuitive menu controls).
