                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by TD's Da Vinci API which contained a huge list of virtual customer transaction information. We then decided that we wanted to created something beneficial for the nation's economy. Canada's current economy consists of almost 98% of small businesses, and helping more small businesses to succeed in their endeavors was an idea we wanted to tackle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mapa helps inexperienced entrepreneurs by providing useful customer information visually. With our heatmap system, users can see where different purchase tags are made. For example, if our customer wants to start a restaurant business, he can look on the map and see locations where customers often purchase food from restaurants. Using that information, he can then choose whether or not he wants to open up a restaurant near that location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a website using javascript, react, as well as Google Maps API. For backend, we decided to utilize Firebase's database to store the important information we extracted from TD Da Vinci API.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team in general was not too familiar with the programming languages used in this program's creation. We ran through a lot of problems including importing information to our database due to unfamiliarity with the programs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud we made a working product by the end of this hackathon. Although there were times we struggled, we were persistent and never gave up. We are proud that our team cooperated well, despite the fact that it was the first time we were working with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team members were inexperienced, as for most of us this was our first ever hackathon. Although we didn't know much in the beginning, the workshops, mentors were very helpful as they helped solve many of our problems. Hack the North 2019 was a very valuable experience for all of us, as it taught us how to use time efficiently, as we had to build an application in only 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mapa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe Mapa has the potential to impact the economy. With the information it displays, it makes it extremely easy for potential new businesses to find out the density of specific industry categories. Our future plans for this application include providing recommendations to users such as leases, renovation companies, or suppliers. We can also use this to generate revenue by promoting paid ads with third-party companies involved in providing these services. Thus, we strongly believe that Mapa has the potential to shape businesses.
