                    Our team had never before worked in Unity, C#, or with the SteamVR API - so this was a learning experience for all of us, that provided an incredibly fun outlet and built us together stronger as a team, in addition to expanding our skillset.

                    "The largest challenges by far came in that we were all entirely unfamiliar with the tech stack we were using - especially Unity. This came down to a lot of Googling, and a lot of just experimenting our way through the project. In addition, we had to work around not having access to power for a few hours, which was a big problem because we couldn't work off a laptop - so without power, we had to write scripts outside of Unity and without our assets." - Ryder James, Team Lead

                    "My personal largest challenge was the script structure of unity. I am used to seeing all the code I am working with and seeing how all the parts interact. When working with unity there was a lot hidden behind the scenes and I couldn't always see the full scope of how things interact." - Elijah Harris, Lead Programmer

                    "The scariest part of the hack-a-thon was when we couldn't figure out hot to import the 3D models I made into the game we were making" - Carson Sena, Graphics Designer

                <p>
                    "The event as a whole was a great experience, it was challenging but kept me entertained. I had challenges because I've never worked with Unity or any of the other technologies used throughout." - Misha Finley, Level Designer
