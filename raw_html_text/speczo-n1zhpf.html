                    Unconscious bias is becoming more prevalent as we are constantly being bombarded by news feeds and articles that are geared towards our preferences. It is critical that we are self-aware of our own preconceived opinions as we browse through a variety of different articles.

                    SpecZo is a google chrome extension which categorizes the articles and displays your bias on a scale from 0-100 for each subtopic. In addition, it quantifies the number of bias articles read and maps this data on a chart. This gives the users a visualization of their perception on the topics.

                    We were able to embed several APIs and integrate all of them to make a successful application.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We do not have to build things from scratch because there are so many APIs that achieve specific tasks and when implemented together in a project, it produces an efficient solution in a relatively short time frame.
