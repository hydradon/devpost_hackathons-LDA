                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Say your going on a road trip with your friends but everyone wants to have the aux. but only one person can have the aux and really control what music is being played. Our app allows everyone in the car to join a room/session and they can add songs they would like to play to our queue, so that everyone can contribute and play a song of their choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows you and your friends to share the aux. Everyone in the session can add songs to be played as well as delete their entries and re arrange the ordering of which the songs will be played.
                </p>

                    building the queue system is difficult.
