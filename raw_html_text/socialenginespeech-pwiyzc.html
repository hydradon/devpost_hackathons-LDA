                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With so much of web design being visual and blind users having to settle for a second-class experience due to their disability only allowing interaction through screen readers, we thought that we could bring real, considered support for a platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the use of voice commands to interact with the platform, with content being read out to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We grabbed the SocialEngine trial product and started playing about with their SDK and database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The SDK was horrible so we had to rebuild from the database up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to incorporate the correct queries for a rather complex database (154 tables!!)

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    The SocialEngine database structure
                    <em>
                        could
                    </em>
                    be more efficient
