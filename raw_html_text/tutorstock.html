                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students ourselves, we've noticed that there is no surefire way to find and set a meeting with a tutor. One can find out about them by word of mouth or flyers. It is not reliable, consistent, and a waste of paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built TutorStock to try and solve these issues
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TutorStock lets you search for tutors by subject and city. A list of tutors appears with relevant information for each of them. Once the student has found the tutor he or she likes, then they can request a meeting. The tutor can then approve or reject the meeting. Students can review the tutors and the students can also become tutors themselves if they want to
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both designed the flow of how it should work, and then we seperately built the iOS client and webapp client which both share the same firebase database
