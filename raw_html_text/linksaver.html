                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was surfing the web for more ideas on what project to make. I came across a site that said that they wanted to see a site that lets clients save the links they want to look at for later that they can interact with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in the elevator pitch, the user can log into their LinkSaver account and input a title (String" for the website and the website url into 2 field boxes. Then LinkSaver takes those fields and displays the title as a clickable hyperlink that will redirect user to that site when they click on it. Also, to maintain user security, the user is logged out upon 5 minutes of idleness (no mouse movement or keys pressed).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accounts are handled in MySQL databases to allow users to log in. All the appearances of pages that appear were coded with html and css, with a little bit of php. The handling of inputs used POST and was written in PHP. The timeout due to idleness was written in Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a huge challenge of getting the clickable hyperlinks because it was difficult to put variables in
                    <a href="" rel="nofollow">
                        tags since the single and double quotes tended to be confusing to navigate and would often simply print out the text "$url" rather than what was stored in $url. I also had a hard time detecting mousemovement and keys pressed in javascript until I found the right event handler methods to use.

                        Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I am most proud of my idletime part of my project because it was the most difficult to program and required an immense amount of research and learning new php and javascript skills I was unfamiliar with.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        What I learned
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I learned more about how various methods in javascript and php (particularly post) interact with HTML to allow the clients and server side to interact. In addition, I learned that in a .php file, you can actually have html code within the php code, such as putting html code in an if statement in php.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        What's next for LinkSaver
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I see this as a very successful starting point for website building. While by no means is this website fully complete and looks nice, it was a good stepping stone for my website building experience and I could implement this as a nice handy app for my website in the future for clients to use.
