                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simp music playing at Z-Center gym making sad workouts.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Detect workout movement speed and patterns to find tempo and rhythm of your workout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soldered an accelerometer/gyroscope IMU on an Arduino wave shield and wrote software to detect changes in motion that reflect rhythm of motion and plays preloaded .wav files through the onboard 3.5mm audio jack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soldering the entire wave shield took away a lot of time and it was both our first time working with Arduinos. The online IDE had some issues as well as documentation for Arduino code wasn't the most extensive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a functional device from having no prior experience with this kind of electronics and no experience with the Arduino programming language/IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extreme soldering skills and microcontrollers/I2C project working
                </p>
