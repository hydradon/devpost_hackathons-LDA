                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Changing community infrastructure is difficult without policy change, so we wanted to try and put that change into the hands of the people who would really be affected by it; the people of Baltimore City. By giving them an easy interface, that includes fitness, health, and safety recommendations, we hope to raise their self-efficacy in their fitness endeavors and to realize that they can flourish without the need for gyms in the area.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website gives the people of Baltimore City the information and the tools to better their fitness and health, while also allowing them to become active in their communities while maintaining their safety. Users can access three tools:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        a Baltimore Map listing all incidences of crime so they understand safe and unsafe areas around them to walk or exercise as well as the location of recreation centers in the area,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a Fitness Game Plan that uses their zip code and demographic data to give them fitness recommendations and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a Nutritional Game Plan (beta) that uses their zip code and demographic data to give them nutritional data
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used weebly as our primary web platform. This is how we plan to interface with potential users. For backend data sources, we used data from Baltimore City Organizations that provided crime data points and placed them onto an interactive map to allow users to easily inform themselves of potentially unsafe areas around them and learn about safe areas near them to exercise. We used the Google Maps Layering feature to layer numerous data points imported using a CSV format from these databases Google Maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had originally planned on tracking sidewalk locations and streetlight locations in neighborhoods and incorporating that information into our Google map, since the presence of those has been shown to raise fitness levels in areas where they are located. After lots of searching, it became apparent that this information was not open source, or even available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first hackathon that all 3 of us have participated in, so I&rsquo;m sure we are all proud that we have a finished product!
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about amazing tools that are out there in terms of health tools and software, website development and html. We feel like we have a game plan now of tools that we can learn before our next hackathon!
                </p>

                    What's next for SafelyFit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we will be able to expand past just Baltimore City to include other areas with nutrition and fitness deserts. We also hope to be able to incorporate grocery delivery to compensate for food swamps/deserts. Also, the inclusion of sidewalk and street light locations would be great to include into our SafelyFit map when/if that information were to become available.

                <p>
                    With this being our first hackathon we had to learn, and we were so glad to have so many hackers who were willing to lend their time and suggestions to our first project! We not only learned a lot about user interaction and widget integration, but also cool tools and tips to use at future hackathons. Specifically big shout out to Aviral Srivastava and Saurabh Khandelwal who provided us with a lot of feedback!
