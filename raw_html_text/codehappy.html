                    As I'm sure you all know, when coding a project it is all too easy to get stuck into a problem, and often block out your surroundings; this can make developers unaware of how much time they are spending on a task. When coding doesn't go well, many developers find it hard to take a step backwards and either come back to the task later, or approach the task from a new angle.

                    We decided to tackle this problem by tracking a developers' sentiment whilst coding, using face recognition. We chose to use Microsoft's Face API, as it provides an easy-to-use REST API, with one request to get all the information we need.
                </p>

                    CodeHappy uses Electron and Vue on the frontend, and a Python Flask server on the backend. The Flask server exposes a REST API to get the emotions detected by the webcam of the user. The frontend makes a request to this API endpoint every 5 seconds in order to show live statistics regarding the developers sentiment over time, in an intuitive dashboard.
