                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was tired of seeing a blank space where there was supposed to be an emoji because my phone did not support the emoji.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app displays a notification which gives users a shortcut to view and send all emojis supported by Unicode 8.0.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the user taps "render" the app takes the last item from the phones clipboard and renders it using iOS 9 emojis.
When the user taps "keyboard" the app opens up a dialog which the user can use to type emojis and then copy and paste them where ever they wish.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java uses UTF-16 for it's
                    <code>
                        char
                    </code>
                    data type. This means every Unicode character can by represented by one
                    <strong>
                        or
                    </strong>
                    two bytes. I didn't know how to figure out if a character will be one byte or two. I solved this problem by first encoding the
                    <code>
                        String
                    </code>
                    in UTF-32BE, this ensured that every character will be represented as four bytes. Then I used sub arrays of length 4 to recreate a list of characters in a
                    <code>
                        String
                    </code>
                    representation.
                </p>
