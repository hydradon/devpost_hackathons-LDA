                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came into this hackathon without very many ideas, and this was simply the best of what we had at the time. As it evolved, we came up with interesting features to add and improve, ultimately ending up on a slightly different project than we had set out to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project uses Django's templating, Bootstrap's CSS, a bit of magic. It is hosted on a DigitalOcean dropplet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just the normal issues that can be encountered when jumping whole-hog into a project for 24 hours. All-in-all, it went relatively smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all pretty impressed with just how much is actually working, considering the amount of time involved. The project sparked some great discussion, and gave us a chance to play with some fun hardware (Muse brain scanner, etc.), even though they weren't actually related to the end product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A group of four dedicated developers can get a lot done in one day, especially when they are all working toward a common goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bucketeer.me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowing how we all work, we will probably continue making updates to this project, even if no one is actively using it. We just like to have a project to work on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Thanks, BrickHack, for putting on such an awesome event. We look forward to doing it again next year with new ideas and bigger goals.
