                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this app arised from the amount of food waste generated by people when there is leftover food uneaten at events and gatherings. We were inspired by a solution founded by a team of MIT researchers called the

                        FoodCam
                    </a>
                    .
                    <img alt="MIT's food cam in action" data-canonical-url="http://www.media.mit.edu/foodcam/takeout-icon.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--HMyGH5zq--/c_limit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto:eco,w_900/http://www.media.mit.edu/foodcam/takeout-icon.png">
                </p>
                <p>
                    We considered to take a more modern approach to this solution by integrating a mobile app into the solution rather than a fixed camera feed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By introducing machine learning into the architecture, our application removes a lot of the overhead from leftover-food announcements, and uses mobile location data to automatically generate social media posts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When event organizers have leftover food, they can simply launch our app, take a picture of the food, and hit Upload. Our own architecture will then compress that image, save it on our Firebase storage, run the image through a MobileNet TensorFlow Model for image classification, and generate a post description. The system will then submit a post to a pre-configured slack channel.
                </p>
