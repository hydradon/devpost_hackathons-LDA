                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many companies emphasize culture and technical skills as being very important considerations when it comes to hiring a candidate. However, while there are plenty of services that help match candidates to companies based on the candidate's technical skills, there are precious few services that aim to match candidates to companies based on culture fit. That is what we aim to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Watson Personality Insights API, we create a personality profile of candidates, and match them with companies that they would be a good fit for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We create a website with a Flask backend, that uses the Watson Personality Insights API to create a user profile and the Twilio API to call the users with their results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was largely inexperienced on the front end side of the equation. As such, a large part of our time ended up being spent on resolving setup errors and catching up on relevant knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud to create a product that not only has a use in our everyday lives, but has the potential to help many of our peers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained experience in creating a full stack application, especially about the front end. We also learned how to use the Watson API, and the Twilio Voice capability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for culturematch.ai
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going forward we hope to expand the number of companies using the service, and allow them options of matching with the candidates who would be a good fit for their company
