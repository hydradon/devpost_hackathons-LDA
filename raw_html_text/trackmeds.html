                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I sometimes have trouble remembering whether I've taken my medication. I wanted a simple, electronic way to record whether I did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trackmeds lets users sign in and list their medications. A user can select which medication they've taken, and the system will record it with the time and date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trackmeds is a simple Ruby on Rails and Materialize CSS application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had some trouble getting forms to work with both Rails and Materialize CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site works and is deployed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about how Rails handles relationships between different models, and more about how Rails does routing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    SSL encryption and visualizations of medication usage are planned.
