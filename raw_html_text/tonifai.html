                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was Ananth's idea - the concept of not intersecting, but rather converting images and music was a fascinating one.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Via the iOS or Android app, pick a contact who you think would enjoy hearing from you what song they remind you of. Their image gets uploaded to the Clarifai API which returns tags of the user. Finally, those tags are searched in a lyric searcher which return the top song their tags match.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Twilio integration and RESTful API was built by Ananth in Python/Flask. Varun worked on the Android app. Jay worked on the iOS app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was pivoting at the last minute from another idea - we're fighting to get done and have a presentable MVP, and this was certainly our biggest challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pivoting super late and making it work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                    Hack, hack, hack!

                    Not sure yet - we can't wait to find out ourselves!
