                    Sometimes when you book a hotel on Booking.com or a room on Airbnb you don't know is it a good place to stay or not.

                <p>
                    We used

                    </strong>
                    and build the app from scratch during the night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first part of Hackathon probably until 0am in the morning today we were building another solution for trucks, but around 1am we changed our mind and created Lynyo - travel recommendations app for your next trip.
