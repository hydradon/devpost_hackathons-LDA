                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on some Fuzzing talks I watched years ago.
Wanted to have a way of analysing security bugs better, making searchable etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I implemented a GDB plugin which calls back to a webs server to list known testcases, then lets you run them in a docker container using GDB server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meant to make it easier to quickly look at a bug.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Set up static builds for most of the software I wanted to run in this environment so I could drop it only my alpine Linux based container. After that, I wrote a backend to store the data + provide messages queues to spawn up containers on demand.
I then implemented plugins for GDB using GEF, which queried this backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I couldn't Vue-Table to work correctly, so I couldn't get the nice web frontend I wanted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Static builds of GDB are fairly annoying to setup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Correcting the worker-queue took a while.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it to be fairly easy to open new debugger instances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing GEF plugins, Vue.js for when I was writing a the frontend that I scraped,

                    What's next for FuzzServ
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a GDB training site would probably be the best thing to do with the core code, so people can learn how to debug using it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe using it to run triage code remotely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Need to make it handle more inputs than just a single file.
