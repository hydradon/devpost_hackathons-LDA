                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It seems silly to have Infusionsoft and yet leave all of your vital customer helpdesk data hostage in another app! Likewise it seems equally silly to build out an entirely new helpdesk software platform. Our inspiration was to integrate two of the best platforms out there to allow each to do what it does best, but still keep all of our customer data where it belongs - in Infusionsoft.
                </p>

                    Product Overview
MyFusion Notes acts as a bridge connecting Zendesk to Infusionsoft with realtime synchronization of Zendesk tickets to Infusionsoft contact notes. MyFusion Notes also allows you to powerfully enhance Zendesk to fire off custom automation campaigns within Infusionsoft automatically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, this is not only automatic, but "behind the scenes". So you can easily outsource your helpdesk staff and yet still have very robust and sophisticated automation tied to it without them having any specialty knowledge of Infusionsoft or your core business practices.

                    Product Features

Full Contact Demographic Data Access and Sync
Includes several pre-built Plug -n- Play campaigns
Includes sample API and Tag Goal campaign tutorials
Suggested Uses &amp; Examples
MyFusion Notes allows you to automatically kick off Infusionsoft Campaigns via simple Zendesk macros. This is extremely powerful and every day we are learning of more and more creative ways that our clients are using its capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some ideas:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Process Refund Requests
Cancel a Subscription
Resend a report download link, fulfillment email that wasn't received, or other product specific information
Notify sales reps of high priority or urgent tickets their clients are submitting
Send out SMS messages to sales force staff in the field in response to customer issues (would require a SMS provider)
Turn the helpdesk into a marketing mechanism by kicking off a nurture sequence after someone initiates a helpdesk request
Send out surveys from within Infusionsoft
Initiate customer satisfaction campaigns such as NPS campaigns
Much, much more...
A Practical Example
Let's imagine you have a recurring membership product and deal with the normal types of support requests:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Processing refund requests
Now let's take it one step further and assume that you have a refund policy that only is valid during the first 30 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With MyFusion Notes, we can fully automate this type of refund request and your helpdesk staff doesn't have to access Infusionsoft, doesn't have to learn Infusionsoft, doesn't have to have an Infusionsoft user account, and best of all, they don't even have to know that Infusionsoft is even connected!
                </p>
                <p>
                    How?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would create a simple Zendesk macro. Now, for those not familiar with Zendesk macros, they are essentially a "canned response". So, when someone asks for a refund, the helpdesk staff simply selects the Requested Refund macro from the drop down list and a standard form reply is sent to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time, this macro can be setup to initiate a campaign automation inside of Infusionsoft either via a Tag Goal or an API Goal. THIS is where the magic begins!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inside of Infusionsoft we could have some logic that would look at when they purchased, send a note or task to an internal user, or even initiate an Infusionsoft API call to automatically determine if they were eligible for a refund and apply it or instead send them the appropriate email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What you can do is limited only by your imagination and creativity within the Infusionsoft Campaign Builder.

                    We're especially proud of how simple it it and that it generates almost zero helpdesk support issues. It's transparent and requires no end-user interface, so there is really nothing to train or teach on. This simplicity is what our users love.
