                    Inspiration...Coding and/or Web design were the intentions of HackYSU2017. When we found the "EmGreat" bots sitting around we decided that we had to build it and that we had to use the Arduino in doing so.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does... Using an Arduino with a sonar senor, H-bridge and some other flashy things, our little bot travels the halls being sure to avoid the walls with its stylish 180s!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it...The hardware required lots of time, electrical tape, and creative balancing of the chassis. The software was developed on Arduino using C++ which was a labor of hate (I mean love) in which much sleep was lost over. In the end, both hardware and software came together to create this bot reminiscent of a Roomba.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into...It caught on fire. We blew up an LED. The soldering iron went through my knuckle. The H-Bridge was unbalanced in power distribution. After seven hours of writing code and forgetting to save, we deleted it and had to start over.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of...Creating a somewhat attractive robot that is capable of some rudimentary functions using a language that was extremely new to some of us. Additionally, correcting for motor imbalances in the code.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned...You don't really need sleep to creatively code a robot to run into walls and catch on fire.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BeepBoopBot...Continued play using the Arduino platform to continue learning coding in C++. Maybe entry into a state science fair....
