                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was we wanted to improve on our school's Personalized Learning Platform for students. We wanted to expand it to allow for learning, not just for schools, but for additional skills outside of school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to share lessons with practice questions and corresponding answers, along with key terms and definitions for each lesson. This allows students to have an online platform where they can essentially study for that specific piece of content, and use that knowledge in their life, whether during school or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to build this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the front-end, and PHP and MySQL in the backend. We did this because we have the skills for these languages throughout our team, and we all feel comfortable in our programming environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge was coming up with an idea for our project. We all seemed to disagree on all the potential topics we discussed for the theme of our project. We also had some trouble getting started, since this idea of creating a social platform for anyone to learn about any topic seemed to be a big task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we struggled in the beginning, we worked through the night and morning and created our website called Learn It All! We created a working, functional, and aesthetically pleasing website which will allow people to upload their own lessons and share them with their friends!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While styling and creating a good-looking website is a priority, we decided to hold off of the styling until the end of the hackathon. Although we did get all of our functionality working, we learned that design was a bigger task than we thought, so we realized that we need to balance our time better if we were to do this over again. We also learned that, if we put our minds to it, we can create a real project that can affect and improve the lives of others all around the world!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Learn It All
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One thing we'd like to add in the future is to allow for embedded videos and presentations, so lesson creators can develop different types of media for each lesson, which can help with people who like to learn different ways (i.e. visually vs. lecture-style).
