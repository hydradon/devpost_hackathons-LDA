                    Inspiration: We are heartened by stories of how there are seniors who have so much to share in terms of culinary skills. Most of them cook as a hobby or as a way to relief stress. Others cook as a way of life and possess culinary skills that have been past down from generations. Letting it be lost is a huge waste
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Our platform seeks to be the one to match the young adults and youths who wants to learn and those that want to impart culinary skills. We will focus on easy UI/UX such that eventually, the seniors are able to use it with ease as well as the students who want to learn
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used HTML5 and CSS3. However, due to a shortage of time, we used wix for half of the site and half is completed using HTML and CSS.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: It is hard to find seniors who are willing to be interviewed on camera as they are camera shy although most of them showed interest and validated our project.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Getting a better understanding on the views and perspective that the seniors have towards the younger generation. Most of them also are excited and willing to pass down their culinary skills to the younger generation. A lot of the seniors are also happy that our project provided them an avenue to stay active and share their feelings and opinions.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: The elderly just want their voices to be heard most of the time. They actually also have a lot of life stories and not just culinary skills that they wish to pass down to the younger generation.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kampung Bagus : We plan to test our idea/prototype on a small community first. Should it succeed, we have plans to work and partner with programs such as elder homes and also to create culinary programs taught to the masses
