                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to write a program that solves a Rubik's Cube.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program takes in a random pattern of a Rubik's Cube and finds the minimum number of steps needed to turn it into a perfect Rubik's Cube.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the program using common lisp with the pure functional programming style.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    The time complexity and space complexity are very high without using a heuristic. Writing a heuristic is challenging and a lot of people took years to figure out a good heuristic. Richard Korf, a professor at UCLA, figured out a good heuristic for this particular problem at this

                    . Unfortunately, a pattern database takes a few days to compute.
