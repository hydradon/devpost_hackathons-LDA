                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is inspired by Pokemon Go game and feel like accomplishing an real world interactive augmented reality App.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays an virtual scene when the camera detects a specific image target, shooting bubbles to the air.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C# and the platform of Android by Unity and finished basic physical movements based on physical engine of Unity and finished the augmented reality part based on Unity also.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Augmented reality project is hard to debug because there is not regular debug tool being able to interrupt these kind of projects. Therefore, we could only build .apk files and run them on the phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized the basic functionality of AR inside Unity. And we have a virtual scene to display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way to realize AR technology using game engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AR Case
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can add more game play functionalities into this app.
