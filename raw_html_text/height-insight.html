                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted something unique, fun, and educational. Height Insight helps all of us, but particularly young children, learn valuable estimation skills by seeing how tall they are compared to other objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Height Insight is a fun applet that informs you of your height in terms of various objects. The user first enters their height in inches, and each time they press a button, an object is randomly chosen. The program then displays a sentence informing the user of their inputted height compared to the randomly selected object, in addition to a witty catchphrase related to the object. This goes on for a while. Once all the objects have been used, the program will offer to restart, and the whole process starts over again!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript in JGRASP to write the code. We then used HTML to display it in a browser.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is extremely difficult to use javascript with HTML in most browsers because the browsers have elaborate security features that initially blocked out javascript program. Eventually, we managed to sufficiently modify the settings to allow our program to run.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we figured out how to use HTML to put a javascript program in a browser - none of us had ever attempted to do that before! We're also proud that we worked together as a team to share ideas and solve our problems together.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use several features in javascript concurrently. We learned how to use HTML to display javascript in a browser. We learned how to organize large data sets using an ArrayList, which was the best data structure for our purpose. We learned a surprising amount about the size of certain objects compared to the size of humans, thus improving our estimation skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Height Insight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were to continue working on this project, we would want to find a way to display pictures. Perhaps we could even show pictures next to a human to better illustrate the height comparison. We might also add more objects, perhaps based on requests from fans.
