                    <li>
                        Inspiration
a.  Dinner is one of the hardest questions with your significant others or friends. We wanted to create a mobile application which would solve that issue with a food-algorithm which would help generate a list of places to eat pertaining to the likes of food the user clicks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What it does
a.  The mobile app prompts the user with some simple questions to gauge the level of hunger, nutrition, price, and time they would like to have. With these inputted data, images will populate that pertain to the level of food the user desires.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How we built it
a.  We used Android studios to make a mobile application for the android platform. We also used firebase to house the database of our food images, opening times of restaurants, food prices and the healthiness for each restaurant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Challenges we ran into
a.  One of a huge challenge we faced was building the database to populate images and the algorithm which would correlate the user input with suggested images. The implementation of the database was unsure due to the lack of knowledge in API and online database. The meta data to correlate images to the user cravings was also a challenge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of
a.  We are very proud of the mobile app that we have made to every aspect. We tried very hard to make the user experience enjoyable and meet their food needs in all aspects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What we learned
a.  We learned that trying to learn about photo recognition and online database was not a one day kind cram. The more you learn about programming, the less you feel like you know.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What&rsquo;s next
a.  Next will be to see how we can increase the impact of this mobile app so that it can be used to help local business or even home businesses if they choose to sell food and encourage healthy eating.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Built with
a.  We built the website off bootstrap and the mobile application on Android Studios.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Try it out
a.  We hope everyone tries it out and it meets their food need. MisoHungry how about you?
