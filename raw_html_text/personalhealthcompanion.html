                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not everyone has someone to talk to for their problems or someone to take care of them. This app solves that problem and address many key issues for the well being of a human.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By saying "Alexa, Life Companion", the personal life companion turns on and various questions can be asked such as "i'm being bullied". Alexa will then respond with a solution to help you out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript and we used 3 totally new services to us including amazon web services, amazon Alexa console and coding the Alexa itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried used multiple defined intents, but we couldn't figure that out and used one. We also had a hard time learning the syntax of Alexa with limited documentation on this product as the product was relatively new. We also had to learn Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about Alexa, Amazon web services, and the Alexa developer console and we are ready to develop more and continue on with the project.

                <p>
                    We tend to expand on the choices in a more organized manner.
