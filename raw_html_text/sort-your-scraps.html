                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The University of Maryland's dedication and initiative for recycling and composting has inspired us to better educate our peers to also be more conscientious about our trash. An important issue today in our world is our lack of awareness when it comes to throwing things away, and many items will end up in the wrong place. For example, glass bottles ending up in our landfills seriously damage the environment. We wanted to create something fun and effective in combating this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game is a simple falling object game where you control a bin that you can toggle between trash, recycling, and compost. Common daily items will fall from the sky, and the goal is to catch the items with the appropriate bin. While also fun, the fast paced nature of this game trains you to sort the different items instinctively, which would lead you to be more aware of where your scraps belong in real life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this game using Python and Pygame. We self-created all of the images using PixilArt and Paint.net. All the music was composed using SoundTrap and the sound effects were taken from Freesound and edited.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging to work with a new language we had little experience with before. We discovered that certain functionalities we wanted to implement slowed down the game, or were not optimal for playing with. In response, we came up with alternative ideas so that the game was still robust.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the way our sprites and soundtrack turned out as they were self-created. For a prototype of the first game we have ever made, we think that it came out pretty well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about how Python works as a language as well as how to use Pygame. We figured out the functionality of groups with sprites so that we could handle an indefinite amount of sprites at once. We learned how to keep track of high scores through different executions of the game by reading and writing into a text file. We learned the basics of animating and timing different images in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sort Your Scraps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would eventually like to add more functionality, as well as make the game more seamless. Future ideas can entail different game modes, additional items, adaptation to mobile devices.
