                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were constantly sharing recipes between family members and friends but there was no single place where everything could be shared and stored.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this app we bring people together over their love of food by sharing recipes and allowing them to purchase the items for recipes.  We also wanted to incorporate the community as a whole and have provided way to donate to local food banks and charities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the react framework with node.js and git as our versioning.  We split up the jobs between the team members and had a very collaborative environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever used react before so we decided to use that after some of the talks about react yesterday to give a try and challenge ourselves.
                </p>
