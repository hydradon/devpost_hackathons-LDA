                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The increased acceptability and convenience of using technology in the classroom has changed the way students learn. Students are moving further away from paper and pen, but often times it's a challenge for those with disabilities to keep up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ## What it does
We created a OCR program that converts lecture notes from an image to a pdf. It helps students with physical disabilities take notes by simply taking a picture to create an easily searchable document.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works by first using OpenCV to detect the rough shapes of the letters. Azure was then used to convert the image into ACSII characters. The resulting text file was converted to a pdf using python. The GUI was done through the tkinter module.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interfacing Azure cognitive services with our application seemed to be a challenge as the helper method was returning an error so we had to work around by uploading into an image sharing platform like imgur and pass the URL to receive the transcribed text in a HTTP request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to overcome challenges regarding the constraints of the Microsoft Azure API. Additionally, we focused on how to split the workload with an agile work environment to ensure efficiency and productivity.

                    What's next for NoteHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NoteHub is currently limited in processing images of notes into text which can be further expanded into Speech to text services to assist hearing impaired individuals. Further processing of the images can be performed to include diagrams and equations in the processed notes. A simplistic mobile application can add more convenience.
