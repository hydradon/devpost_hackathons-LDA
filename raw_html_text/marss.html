                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this world of advanced technologies, everything needs to be safe, especially the things which matters like medical records. Thus we came up with an idea of storing medical records using blockchain so the privacy of the patients is protected. With the protected privacy this app also makes sharing of medical records easy and safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application stores the patients' medical records using blockchain technology and it also allows those records to be sent easily and safely as it makes sure the records are not tempered before sending and before receiving the medical record.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application currently has a javascript backend and it uses crypto.js for the blockchain hashing and the app has a frontend written using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the team members had any prior knowledge of the blockchain technology so we ran into troubles but with the help of Google, we were able to overcome those challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to learn a new technology in a weekend and were also able to integrate into an app which has potential to change many lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Secord
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, Secord is just proof of concept but in the future, it will have a backend with database and it will be able to scale up. Secord will also have more secure blockchain and will also have ability to react if there is any of the data is compromised.
