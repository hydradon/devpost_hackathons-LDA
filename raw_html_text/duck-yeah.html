                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It begins with you signing up and verifying your phone number. Once that's done, you get assigned a personal Duck trainer/life-coach/guardian-angel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You associate your various services (or use the generic webhook) to trigger "quacks" (actions).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each quack sends you an SMS. "Duck Yeah" learns how you're doing, and offers words of encouragement/congratulations depending on how you're doing. Slacking off with your jogging? The Duck will remind you. Doing really well with the diet? The duck knows, and remembers to congratulate you.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Meteor and the Nexmo REST api.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never used MeteorJS before. On top of that, apparently the Nexmo Verify JS SDK only supports newer version of NodeJS (newer than what's compatible with Meteor). I wasted a ton of my time chasing some cryptic errors before Nexmo support pointed me towards the likely culprit. I ended up doing the verify manually. (using Nexmo REST sms API). HUGE props to Nexmo support for helping out!
