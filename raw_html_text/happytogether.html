                <p>
                    Studies says that women are more likely than men to experience symptoms of stress and, women who are stressed are more likely to experience depression and anxiety. Music can help reduce the stress. HappyTogether makes women feel happy by playing their favorite and popular music.

                    How does it work
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HappyTogether is a Chatbot that helps you feel happy and relaxed after a hard day. It measures heart rate and asks &ldquo;how are you feeling today?&rdquo;. Based on your answer, it will recommend music using Machine Learning Algorithm to cheer up your mood. It will measure the heart rate again and if it&rsquo;s not within normal range,  then recommend some more music.
