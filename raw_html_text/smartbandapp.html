                    Smart band App visual tool
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goal:
Achieve the data visualization for all kinds of bands
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why we do it:
Microsoft Band or Fitbit tracks your heart rate, exercise, calorie burn, and sleep quality, and keeps you connected with email, text, and calendar alerts.
Microsoft features 11 sensors, including a GPS, UV monitor, and barometer. And with the power of Microsoft Health, you have the tools you need to reach your goals. And Fitbit has the similiar features.
Our project is a website-based visual tool for multiple kinds of smart bands. The visualization of Band is not intuitive. Wrapping your brain around data can be challenging and
trying to find related content can also be difficult. But data visualizations can make all of that much easier, allowing you to see the concepts that you&rsquo;re 
learning about in a more interesting, and often more useful manner. Our application is aimed to use multiple cloud API to visulize the data from smart band in order to fulfill more demands of the customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we do it:
We use the Microsoft and Fitbit band as our test products and use Microsoft and Fitbit API obviously. Each member could login with their own accounts.
For now, we work out 4 example graph for specific parameters.
