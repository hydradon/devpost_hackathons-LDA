                    We created this project to help educate people about financial responsibility in an engaging and exciting way! Funancial is a board game inspired website. As you roll the virtual die, opportunities will pop up, prompting you to choose one of two options. The option you choose determines which way you go and shows whether YOU are responsible financially! We tailored our game towards high school students, filling it with opportunities that teenagers may encounter in their personal lives, teaching them how their choices can negatively or positively affect them. It guides them on how they have to problem solve in the future and how they have to make some sacrifices for the greater good. BUT, don't let this stop you from playing Funancial! Anyone of any age can play- Are you as financially responsible as you think you are?
