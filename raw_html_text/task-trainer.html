                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always feel more engaged with interactive apps and websites, so I wanted to use interactivity to motivate myself to complete tasks, which I often leave for months incomplete on my to-do list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows editing and creation of to-do list tasks. Completed tasks are rewarded by new plants in the virtual garden.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Java and XML in Android Studio to build the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building the database was a mostly new experience, as I wasn't experienced with MS SQL or SQLite. I ended up fitting in the graphics at the very end, so they unfortunately are not what I had hoped.
                    <strong>
                        Unfortunately there is still a glitch where a new task is duplicated at first (but it goes away when the next task is created).
                    </strong>

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the editable list of tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That it's really useful to plan out my time and structure the progress of a project, no matter how many people (or how few) are working on the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further updates on graphics and interactivity with the garden, as well as more variety in the plants! Animation is also a possibility.
                </p>
