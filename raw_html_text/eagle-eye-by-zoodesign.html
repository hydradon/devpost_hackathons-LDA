                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problems in wildlife encouraged us to take part in the ZooHackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes images that are scanned by infrared motion sensors and filters them so that the rangers in wildlife preserves get correct alerts when potential threats are detected(e.g. Humans)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, OpenCV, Photoshop
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Noise due to various movements in the background
Pixels isolation amongst photo layers
Differentiation between sharp intensity gradients
Differentiation between a human disturbance and animal disturbance
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    creating our very own original homemade algorithm for preprocessing
being able to actually process images
working as a team
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
