                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students at Bronx Science, we are constantly using the site Pupilpath which has all of our grades and averages. However, most students do not know how Pupilpath calculates their averages. This can make determining the test grades needed to reach a certain goal very difficult. So, we decided to create a website that does just that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can input their current test grades, their weights, the amount of tests left in the marking period, and their goal, and our website will tell them the average they will need on these tests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized sqaurespace, javascript, and html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript is hard.  We tried DigitalOcean, but the login failed.  Debugging is also hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a really long code in a day.  Also, we think our idea is pretty relevant and useful.  Probably the biggest accomplishment is cracking Pupilpath's averaging system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how scary deadlines for codes are.  We learned quite a bit on working as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Grade Manager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to factor in whether or not midyears are dropped.  Potentially, we can do some research on study times v. grades and recommend studying time.  We could even go beyond Pupilpath to incorporate other online grading systems.
