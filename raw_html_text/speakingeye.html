                <p>
                    Alex' girlfriend trains guide dogs for blind people, so he has pretty often contact to blind people and realized the need for a cheap and easy way to participate in everyday activities like going grocery shopping or eating out. There are about 100k blind people in Germany and about 170k profound visually impaired which can not participate in everyday's activities independently. Right now they still rely on social workers who help them to master the daily grind. We do have the technology and the algorithms to provide them significant help and improve their quality of life - let's tackle this problem!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app speakingEye is the personal speech assistant for visually impaired people. speakingEye uses the smartphone camera to capture and detect objects and texts to support visually impaired people in their daily life. It can be completely controlled by voice commands or gestures and uses text to speech to guides and supports the user through the world. It can be used for several use cases. The use case we implement at opencodes is a grocery shopping assistant. One of the biggest struggles of visually impaired people is shopping for groceries. They have no ability to compare prices of products. One workaround for them is, that they use a text to speech engine to "listen" to an online shopping portal (i.e. dm.de, real.de). This is not applicable in an local "offline" store. Using computer vision and machine learning algorithms the app detects the products and their prices in the shelf and communicates them to the user, so the user can compare the prices by themselves.
