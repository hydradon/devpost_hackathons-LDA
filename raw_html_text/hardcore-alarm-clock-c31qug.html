                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have dreams and aspirations that we seemingly never get around to: exercising, learning a new skill, spending more time with the people we care, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built this app as a no-BS approach for people who want to get more out of their days, because the way you live every day is the way you live your life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our alarm clock is still unfinished, but in concept, it would sync with the user's Twitter account and posts a self-berating tweet or image if the user fails to wake up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a SQL database in AWS through Django, which synchronizes to the Android App, which uses the Twitter API to get the user's data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We had issues running the instance and accessing it due to the firewall in ITESM
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating the background service and broadcast receiver have proven to also be quite a challenge (Alarm starts from the moment it is activated)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Linking the Android app and DB
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Getting very positive feedback for the idea and pitch by other developers
                    </li>

                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Never underestimate the time and effort coding new things will take (usually 2x the time and 3x the effort.. ha)

                    <li>
                        The user being able to give the app actual "bullets" - info and images he or she doesn't want the world seeing, thus giving the alarm all it needs to coerce the user into wakefulness
