                    Inspiration:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We often idolize Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and think they are special. However, we fail to look at the opportunities they had to unleash their potential. However, in developing world many such &ldquo;special&rdquo; kids because of lack of resources cannot pursue quality higher education to become future change-makers. Moreover, such students have the greatest potential to make an impact since they have personally faced the hardship and are best equipped in solving the same, if provided with the tools of education. On meeting such a kid such as Sushma, who got masters at age 15 from the university where her father works as a janitor, inspired all of us, and made us work for this mission.

                    FundKnowledge is a crowdfunding platform, which finds outliers in developing countries and funds their college education. We find such students by partnering with grassroot level organizations, and donations given are accountable since one can exactly know to who their money is going. Using features such as built-in Skype and Google street view alongside video pitches, the donors can emphatize with the student and their story. Also, due to integrating twitter and chat features, donors will be in alongside their student and receive updates as the go on to change the world.
