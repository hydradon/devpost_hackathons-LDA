                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our APCS teacher mentioned in class and it sounded interesting. We decided to take it a step further and make a program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simulates cell growth across as many generations as you like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rules:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            A &ldquo;neighbor&rdquo; of a cell is defined as any living cell touching that cell. For example, a cell has 8 possible neighbors, but only the ones that are alive count as neighbors.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Any living cell with one or zero neighbors will die of loneliness, while any living cell with four or more living neighbors will die from overcrowding. These are "deaths".
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Any living cell with two or three neighbors will continue living into the next generation (no change).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Any dead cell with exactly three neighbors will come to life in the next generation. These are "births".
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            All births and deaths occur simultaneously.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used IntelliJ as an IDE and Java as our language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The graphics were a little difficult to create. The logic for determining neighbors took some time and debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Graphics and the efficiency of the algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to write efficient code and turn something simple into a complex structure.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow the user to add individual cells whenever they want.
Add a pause button.
Make the grid infinitely sized.
