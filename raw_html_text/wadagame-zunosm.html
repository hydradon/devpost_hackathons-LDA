                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do you ever wonder what game a stranger play ? Just like Shazam goal for music, we don't often know all video games. Without bother the person, you known already what he play. Take a picture and the application do the job for you.

                <p>
                    It all started for the studenthack V. The idea came originally from Anthony who is interested in big data and image processing/analysis. His intentions were to ease the communication and the search for the name of the games.

                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The user takes a picture by android phone of a video game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The image is processed and the algorithm perform a reverse image search with IncandescentAPI.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The algorithm learns keywords by url names output by the second step.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The most relevant keywords are kept and so do the name of the game.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using Xamarin and openCV to process the photos captured with the phone. The picture is upload via POST request to a server. The server use IncandescentAPI to do reverse image search and gives json file containing url of lookalike pictures in the web. Keywords are learned from the latter. Name is discovered.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Find an API for reverse image search.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finishing the application.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to split our work equally and work while being (very) tired 
We also learned to use better the technologies involved in this project (Xamarin, python, Flask, openCV, Google APIs, Neural Networks, ...)

                    What's next for WaDaGame
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WaDaGame is basically just a proof of concept for video games application but it can actually also be used for many other fields.
Databases already exists but what we need is a way to use all the available informations to get a unified and relevent feed of infomation.
