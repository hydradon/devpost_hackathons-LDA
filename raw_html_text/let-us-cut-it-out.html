                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Who wants to read whole story these days? We daily deal with humungous text and it may be impossible to read every bit of those.  So wouldn't it be nice if we can ask an intelligent machine to summarize it for us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app asks users to provide text which they want to summarize.  Along with that users can also select the scale by which they want to summarize.  Then finally within no time the app will produce the summary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google's cloud service for Natural Language Processing (N.L.P.) and integrated the app in python.  We used the flask framework for running this app on localhost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google's trained N.L.P. algorithm does a good job in analyzing the sentiment of the text.  However, it was challenging for us to decide on what parameters we should summarize the whole text and also preserve the important information that comes along with the text.  We developed our algorithm to efficiently summarize the whole text.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are proud that we have realized our idea in such a short time.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Google Cloud's NLP api as well as Flask and Heroku.

                <p>
                    We want to further do the analysis of essays and their prompts so as to grade those essays according to the need.
