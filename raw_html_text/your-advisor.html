                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the OSAP cuts, as second-year university students, we financially struggled. Since the stock market and investing are some of our biggest interests, we wanted to use our knowledge and help others also gain financial independence and confidence.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It features our favourite 15 stocks of the month and it draws a personalized path regarding risk and duration. It asks for your monthly income and how much risk you are willing to take, in order to prevent you from taking a bigger risk than you can afford. If your monthly income is below $3200 it will suggest low-risk stocks regardless of your preference. After your answers, it shows you the possible stock picks for you. Although, if you choose to invest in low risk, low return, long term stocks, it takes you to a separate page with a built-in compound interest calculator by asking you how much of an initial investment you are going to start with, how long you are planning on investing, and how much you can contribute to your portfolio on a monthly basis. It calculates total invested value, balance and profit. It is also possible to view all our stock picks for each category without providing any personal data.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end with html5 and CSS. We used javascript to create the functions and the calculations. Bootstrap was used to design buttons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript syntax was difficult to work with since we had no prior javascript experience.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a complete product that we are interested in that can help others gain financial health by encouraging them to invest intelligently based on their income.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The planning and design phases were a lot more difficult and time consuming compared to the programming phase.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Better looking interface. Also, we would like to use yahoo finance databases to visually portray live data. We also plan on making a mobile app.
