                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One morning in early september Andy was in the shower, scrubbing when it hit him, what if there was an app out there on the market called "Vortech" that could detect email types and apply actions based on those types. Andy had kept the idea quiet till late February when he came out with Vortech, at HackIllinois.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A better question would be what doesn't it do? Vortech is a fully featured dynamic reactive application that allows users full customizability in everything they would want with email. Vortech will save lives. Vortech is love. Vortech is life.
                </p>
