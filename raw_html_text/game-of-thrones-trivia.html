                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During my internship, I got a chance to familiarize myself with the wonders of Amazon Web Services and while doing so, I stumbled upon the Alexa skill kit. An avid fan of Game of Thrones that I am, I could not think of anything else to base my first skill on; hence the Game of Thrones trivia skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game of Thrones Trivia is a simple trivia that asks the player 5 questions and based on how many questions the player was able to answer correctly, a reference to a horrible death scene from the show is made except of course in the scenario where the player answers all five questions correctly.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build Game of Thrones trivia using the different services provided by AWS and node JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was pretty new to the whole world of AWS. So understanding the functionality of each service was the biggest challenge I faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The very fact that this skill is doing fairly well on the marketplace makes me proud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this experience, I learnt how different AWS services work together with the Echo device.

                    What's next for Game of Thrones Trivia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I intend to upgrade the skill by adding In Skill Purchases and by implementing a leaderboard to keep track of high scores obtained by players.
