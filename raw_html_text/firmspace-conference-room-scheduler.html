                    is an upscale office coworking/executive suites startup with built-in conference room scheduling and other features. Some of our first members are busy executives and prefer not to log into the app for some tasks. Alexa provides an exciting and simple interface our members can use without even touching a computer.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FIRMSPACE Conference Room Scheduler allows members of our community to create conference room reservations without using the app.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js and custom Alexa Skills Kit

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I encountered some difficulties with the GUI Alexa Skills Dashboard and the Lambda management console. It's going to take time to build the interaction model to allow more natural, conversational options.

                <p>
                    I am somewhat surprised that I actually finished a prototype!

                    Too much to say!

                <p>
                    I plan to implement account linking and add user validation of some kind, such as Cognito verification codes. After that, we'll make a skills group and allow guest registration, notifications, etc
