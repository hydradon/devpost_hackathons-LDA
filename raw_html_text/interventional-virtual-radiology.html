                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To better train the residence and fellows for minimally invasive image-guided procedures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps to perform and learn minimally invasive image-guided procedures without compromising patient safety.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity3D editor and Windows Mixed Reality.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D designs and 2D transformation.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working training MR tutorial for residence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is hard, and doable, and takes some experience programmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Interventional Virtual Radiology
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will do touch up and refine until have a fully functional prototype and present it in the Society of Interventional Radiology.
