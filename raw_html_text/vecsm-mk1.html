                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought "It's hard to work with our weekly amount of money"

                    So, we made a program that will help you track everything.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    It was hard to really visualize the project and how it should all work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We finished all the planning and now know how it should all look.
