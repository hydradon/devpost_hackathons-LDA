                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create a network of friends to share knowledge, learn new technologies and take at least one of us to Canada, so he can take us all!!!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It enables the API consumer to create recipes with ingredients and see the nutritional information. It also allows searching for recipes within a range of calories (energy)

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the REST API using the LTS version of Laravel (5.1 LTS). We defined the required endpoints for the backend and split them among the team members.
We don't live near each other, so we used google docs to brainstorm and to write the documentation, skype to communicate and bitbucket/git to version the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took some time to define the initial project architecture and we believe that a little bit more time to plan the whole project would be good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the group's dynamics and that we were all able to discuss ideas and extract the best of them without running into any divergences.
We built a nice API and we were able to learn a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well... We all worked together in all the steps of the project: planning, definitions, implementing and testing...
This hackathon was good to learn from our teammates' experience, since all of us work with PHP since the last decade and we came from PHP 4.
We improved our skills of team work and remote job collaboration and our knowledge of PHP Unit and REST.
