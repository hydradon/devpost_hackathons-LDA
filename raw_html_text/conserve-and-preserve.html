                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People waste water. Why? They have too much freedom. We are restricting their rights to use water in cases of low soil moisture and low water reserve levels to benefit society and give water to who needs it the most (aka us).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a complex mathematical model developed in a research paper at the hackathon (Taylor and Zapote, 2019), we use inputs from a soil moisture sensor and a water depth sensor to automatically restrict water usage of the unworthy.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Raw inputs are fed into the arduino where they are processed and sent to a node.js server over serial. The node server then forwards the data to firebase where it can then be accessed on the water restriction dashboard (as long as we decide not to restrict their internet).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Water and electronics do not mix. 18 volt power supply and 12 volt component do not mix. Software developers and hardware do not mix.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Writing a research paper in a day, making a product with hardware that looks decent.

                    What I learned

                    How to use various sensors with arduinos and how to use firebase.
