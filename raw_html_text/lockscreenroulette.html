                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Home Depot said make something stupid and fun, so we did.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    lockScreenRoulette hijacks your phone's lock screen with a random minigame. To unlock your phone, you need to reach a certain score on that minigame. You can easily switch between games if you're really bad at one of them by just tapping your phone's sleep button. After you win, the game harasses you by telling you how much time you wasted unlocking your phone, then allows you to share that shameful information with all of your friends.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of pain and copy and paste (every Android app ever).

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding games that worked well within our application was very hard. Scouring github for open source games that weren't garbage using eight different third party libraries was a challenge.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    It works!

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Drawing over the Android lock screen. General ways to mitigate Android being Android.
