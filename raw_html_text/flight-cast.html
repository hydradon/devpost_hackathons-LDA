                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used flask as our main framework, and utilized multiple API's(google Maps, OpenWeatherMaps,AAirlines API)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding non-proprietary api  for our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The things we are most proud of is stitching our project together. Each of us worked on a different part of the application and then combined them together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of having modularity between files, that everything doesn't always workout how its supposed to be, and the way to deal with it is to analyze the problem and adapt to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flight Cast
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement way for the User to make accounts, show users their flights purchased while actually implementing a way to show cool historical events/cool things to do in the destination. That way users feel as if the airline really want them to enjoy their stay.
