                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picture this: you're home alone and you have to make yourself a meal, but you don't know what to make. You want something healthy. Perhaps you want to try something new. Above all, you want to make something out of what's already in the fridge. Your solution? SNACC. _ Gone are the days of finding recipes that contain ingredients you don't already have. _
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SNACC allows you to browse through recipe suggestions based off of the ingredients you already have at home. By simply taking a photo of your grocery receipts, SNACC is able to identify and create an "inventory" of the ingredients you purchase and have at home. This inventory can always be accessed, and doubles as a grocery list to remind you of what you may want to purchase in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used firebase functions to listen to firebase firestore writes. The firebase functions queried from 
the Edamam API to populate firestore with detailed food recipes and information. We used firebase ML Kit to parse receipts. We used Flutter as the framework for the mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to create a recommendation engine that would predict items to purchase based on a user's financial and purchase history, but couldn't due to bugs in deployment on Google Cloud Platform; this is proposed for future work. We stumbled into matching errors of food names between receipts from varying vendors, which pushed us to use the Edamam API further to validate keywords representing food items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Things we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had two novices learning the essentials of firebase and flutter. The experienced members had the chance to experiment with firebase functions and serverless computing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Future work
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We propose to partner with large vendors to create the future "UBER EATS" for groceries in order to allow clients to receive personally tailored groceries at the door.
