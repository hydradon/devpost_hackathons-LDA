                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After hitchiking all around Europe and other parts of the world, Diana realized that the hitchiking community is ready to enter the wonderful world of tecnology! After hering about the idea, Albert decide to join immediately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows hitchikers and nice car drivers get in touch. Also, there's a review system that helps build trust between users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learnt Android Studio in one day, and we crazily coded afterwards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google maps api is horrible and it took a while to get used to android studio as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt to never give up. We learnt that even hell is conquerable!
