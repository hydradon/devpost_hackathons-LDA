                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I (Maahi Chowdhury) have volunteered for over 40 nonforprofit organizations cumulatively working over 2000 hours, and raised thousands of dollars for different nonprofits. How did I do this? I never did it alone. I was always a leader of a local community service chapter or a collegiate organization and while I loved the volunteering, I did not enjoy scouring through the internet for different opportunities or keeping track of the hours that my team and I had completed.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seek and Serve is a web-based product that creates a matching process between Nonforprofit organizations and local service chapters that also tracks the volunteer data.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nodered as a server, HTML as a code.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many. Mostly technical but some operational as well. Data management while we figured out how to use mongodb to implement in our tech architecture actually buying usable products were expensive or we just did not have the time to code.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have a strong coding background. And we learned to code. We overcame many education barriers through flowcharting our ideas and implementing them systematically.
