                    QuakeReport helps people become aware of earthquakes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prosper published his QuakeReport Android app that he built to the Google Play Store and Sam ran paid Facebook traffic to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran a likes campaign first to Pakistan, Nigeria, and Thailand so as to get real people to like the app at low cost in order to make the app, whose business page we only created today, look more established, which tends to increase click through rate and make users more comfortable and enthusiastic to install it. We got over a thousand likes from these countries in an hour for $20 and then started to run the install ads to the US and got US consumers to install the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    12 strangers who had no idea who Prosper was, I was, or QuakeReport was, saw our ad on the internet, and with no incentivation, and no ratings on the app yet, decided our app would provide enough value to them that it was worth downloading it onto their phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cost per install, or cost per acquired user (aka CPA, cost per acquisition) was about $15 on Hackday. So, we spent about $180 and got 12 unique users (Google Play purportedly counts a user installing on multiple devices as one install) to install.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next steps for us to get more users could include incentives, ads with different angles, and analytics that look at the users' use of the app in order for us to understand what it is they want and reduce churn (using something like Flurry, for mobile analytics, so we can responsibly observe the users' use of the app).
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that we could maybe find a way to monetize it with in-app purchases of the one most important thing users want so that we can find our CAC (cost per acquired customer) and scale the app with that feature if the CAC is profitable, or, we could just focus on building out an incredible product first and run more traffic to it for the sole reason of improving it with real time user feedback from strangers who click our ad(s). Lastly we could I suppose try to pitch for some 'friends, family, or fools' seed money that could help us attract a team and accelerate all of the above in whichever direction we are heading towards whether that's profitability or going all out on design and usability in attempts to have the initial conditions necessary to attain the mythical 'viral launch' from some sort of incentivation scheme, distribution effort, or as a result of the fabled 'it took off via purely word of mouth'.
