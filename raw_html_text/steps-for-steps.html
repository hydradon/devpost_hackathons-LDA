                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by applications like FreeRice and Ecosia that allow users to improve their world by completing tasks they already perform in their everyday lives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Steps For Steps is a pedometer based app where for every 1000 steps a user walks, 5 cents is donated to a prosthetics organization. This money is generated through the use of small advertisements on every page of our app. All the user has to do is walk around with the mobile application open, and they will be helping those who cannot walk at all. In addition, the user can use the app to track their own daily step counts and compare their step counts to others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We incorporated Apple's accelerometer feature into our app, which was coded with Xcode. All graphics were created with Adobe Photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first Hackathon, and our first time working with iOS development, so just getting everything set up and learning the syntax was a challenge. In addition, we wanted to integrate Intel's Edison into our app, but we could not get the hardware to work, which was disappointing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was our first Hackathon, and we had no experience in app development, everything we learned was new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for steps for steps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to incorporate Intel's Edison into our app, as was our original plan. We were also considering using Google mobile ads in order to create the revenue necessary to achieve our goal. Finally, we would eventually like to link the app to social media.
