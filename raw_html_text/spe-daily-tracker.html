                    We were inspired by multiple applications and advertisements we've seen and used. This program tracks sleep, exercise, and mood patterns and reports it to the user each week. We learned how to code in two languages; Xcode SwiftUI. We built it by watching tutorials and asking mentors for help. The challenges we faced included figuring out how to use Xcode and SwiftUI to make our project function. We are proud of successfully creating a working program. We would like to continue adding features to the app and promoting the app to the school districts for students to use.
