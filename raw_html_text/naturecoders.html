                    When I finished the Girls Who Code summer immersion program in DC I got really inspired to have coding come into the natural world we live in, so I created NatureCoders. NatureCoders are little 3D printed "robots" that teach kids in elementary and middle school how to code with C++ and the Arduino by following along with a story. After the complete the project from the story they can take it outside and interact with the nature that's around them.

                <p>
                    There is a website that will have the lessons on how to program your NatureCoder. The prototype of the bug was the hardest thing to make. The 3D printer did not want to print my template I had so the design had to change. 
NatureCoders is continuing to grow by adding other bugs that will teach kids how to code in a fun atmosphere.
