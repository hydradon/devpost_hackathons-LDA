                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the time cows are dying from an illness which should have been noticed. Or escaping never to be found again. This is not good for dairy farmers as each cow costs upwards from &pound;1200 and with 3.7 million cows lost to non-predatory causes every year. Our system is clearly highly important.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our system uses a LoraWAN gateway in which is connected to an ear tag on each cow. This ear tag is equipped with onboard positioning and temperature &amp; moisture sensors. This not only feeds data back to the farmer but all information is fed directly to the consumer who can see all of the details about their cow all the way from the field directly to their doorstep. Choosing delivery either via traditional milk float, local cyclists similar to Deliveroo or even (soon to come) drone delivery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a moisture sensor and a temperature sensor connected up to an ExpLorer which was then connected to a LoraWAN gateway. All of which feeds back into the Farmer dashboard and customer app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was very complex to intergrate into the remote web server alongside actually getting the front end finished!
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a damn good frontend and an even better business plan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never EVER celebrate early. There is always more work to be done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Where's my Milk?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're looking to expand a trial out to a small handful of farmers in and around Reading in order to distribute custom locally sourced milk.
