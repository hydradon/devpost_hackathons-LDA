                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all live away from home and we realize the importance of staying connected to our loved ones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the Pico pro maker kit from android things to get the patient's heart beat that is displayed in our app for all of the patient's caretakers. If the Caretaker observes any dangers in the value, he/she can immediately call a pharmacy to order drugs to be delivered home, call the emergency number or take a lyft back home. Similarly, a patient can open this app to contact his/her caretaker in times of need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Arduino, Android things and Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android things is relatively new and we did not have much documentation to work off of. This required a lot of low level programming with hardware which we were unfamiliar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the heartbeat sensor connect with our android app and this is something we are really proud of. We also figured out how to use arduino as an ADC for our pico Development Board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The importance of working hard and most importantly keeping at it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Beats by Us:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love for it to give more details about the patients other than the heart rate with the help of Internet Of Things, for example, his diet and exercise routine and whether or not he/she has taken his/her pill.
