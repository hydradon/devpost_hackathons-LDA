                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the need for students to be able to calculate their grades in anticipation of a final exam.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gradinator calculates what you need on a final to get a desired grade in the class.  Gradinator considers test, homework, quiz, and participation grades, along with extra credit.  Simply type in your grades and click the "Grading Magic!" button.  After that, scroll down to view a study tip!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gradinator is a webapplication made with HTML, CSS for design, and JavaScript to calculate grades.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to figure out the alignment and page layout.

                    I finished it. :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to autocomplete forms.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Gradinator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, Gradinator could autocomplete with more classes.  The ones I used are some of the ones I'm taking now.  An API with grade weights for certain classes could also be used.  Additionally, extra grade sources could be added if needed, such as term papers or projects, which don't fit in the available sources.
