                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind this was to help doctors gain more information about their patient's sleep habits. Recent studies have showed that sleep tracking can give insight into diagnoses and medicine. My idea behind this idea was to track EMG with a myo wristband to help diagnose patients that might have sleep disorders or be applicable to track muscle and nerve function of patients who exhibit motor related illnesses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My program pulls data from the myo wristband and sorts the raw data into a more useful form. It takes this organized data and provides statistical analysis such as a hypothesis to provide information to the user if the should become worried about their EMG sleep behavior.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using an existing application to collect the raw data from the myo wristband. I then imported this raw data into my own function where I sorted it and shortened it by allowing the user to determine which set of data variables they want. I then created additional statistical functions that evaluates the data and warns the user if their sleep is indicating something about their illness.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges I ran into were that I had no prior experience to working with myo wristband and gathering data from a device such as this one. I also had trouble writing a system that would not have a set time but rather continue until data stopped being collected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very proud of this project since I created it all on my own and wrote it in many forms of code that I had not known well before. I am also proud that I was able to create a product that not only works in the context of the problem but could help many individuals with certain types of illness. It can also provide more information to diseases that have little research at this point.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned how to use a myo wristband and also how to incorporate my code into other's applications. I also learned how to use different interphases.
                </p>

                    What's next for EMG Sleep Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to continue to improve on and start working on making it more usable for people with mental illnesses and/or epilepsy, I believe this application can benefit individuals with these diseases.
