                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by pop up books. We loved the magic of picking one up and seeing these three dimensional shapes pop into life. However, we didn't just want to just create a pure technology version of a pop up book. Namely, we wanted to keep the experience of turning a page and seeing the structure appear, but simply, augmented. Story Pop combines the new and the old into a truly magical experience.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Story Pop app allows you to read books that use Augmented Reality to create an immersive, one of a kind experience. In turn, the Story Pop website allows parents to create their own books that their children will cherish for years to come.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Ruby on Rails stack with GraphQL and React for the basic website. Then, we created an Augmented Reality app with Vuforia in Unity.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We at first attempted to use iOS and React Native before settling on Unity. We also ran into several permissions issues on iOS.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We basically built 3 applications in parallel between the 2 of us. Also, we had to learn iOS, then Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figure out what needs to be installed sooner. Learn Swift earlier.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Story Pop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to explore the idea with a more robust AR technology, maybe iOS's ARKit.
