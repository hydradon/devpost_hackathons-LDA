                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Pebble is awesome. Punching is awesome. Falcons are awesome. So we decided, using dark arts, to craft the trifecta of awesome: Falcon Punch for Pebble Time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Falcon Punch is meant to make learning about nature super awesome. Punch as fast or as slow as you want, then learn about your Punch Animal. Punch as fast as a running bear? Learn some bear facts. Also, with Force of Nature mode, match the speed of the animal displayed on the Pebble for an added challenge. Can you punch as fast as a running tortoise? How about as fast as a cheetah? Get as close as you can!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Pebble web development platform, CloudPebble, we were able to quickly edit and demo the code as frequently as we needed to make Falcon Punch a reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accelerometers are tricky business. As is remembering how to actually apply high-school physics to punching. These were our most daunting tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It actually works, which is pretty awesome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Punching fast is significantly harder than anticipated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Falcon Punch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More gametypes, more education, and more punching!
