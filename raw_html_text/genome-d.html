                    I also learned that much of the Medical world is transitioning to using Genetic data to find out which genes/genetic insights that causes certain sicknesses and control measures on how to cure thediseases.

                    Medical Research has showned that Alcohol can be both good and bad for your health. By drinking alcohol only in moderation generally one drink a day for women, or two a day for men you can potentially lower your blood pressure by about 4 mm Hg.
                    <br>
                    One drink equals 12 ounces of beer, five ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor.
                    <br>
                    But that protective effect is lost if you drink too much alcohol. Drinking more than moderate amounts of alcohol can actually raise blood pressure by several points. It can also reduce the effectiveness of blood pressure medications.

                    BMI (body mass index) is used to measure the level of obesity. It is the body weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared.
                    <br>
                    According to Medical Experts,
Blood pressure often increases as weight increases. Being overweight also can cause disrupted breathing while you sleep 
(sleep apnea), which further raises your blood pressure.

                    <br>
                    Weight loss is one of the most effective lifestyle changes for controlling blood pressure. 
Losing even a small amount of weight if you are overweight or obese can help reduce your blood pressure. 
In general, you may reduce your blood pressure by about 1 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg) with each kilogram (about 2.2 pounds)
 of weight you lose.

                    According to Medical Experts, The role caffeine plays in blood pressure is still debated. 
Caffeine can raise blood pressure up to 10 mm Hg in people who rarely consume it. 
But people who drink coffee regularly may experience little or no effect on their blood pressure. 
Although the long-term effects of caffeine on blood pressure aren't clear, 
it's possible blood pressure may slightly increase.

                    <br>
                    To see if caffeine raises your blood pressure, check your pressure within 30 minutes of drinking a caffeinated beverage.
 If your blood pressure increases by 5 to 10 mm Hg, you may be sensitive to the blood pressure raising effects of caffeine.
 Talk to your doctor about the effects of caffeine on your blood pressure.

                    Exercise regularly.
According to Medical Experts, Regular physical activity &mdash; such as 150 minutes a week, or about 30 minutes most days of the
 week &mdash; can lower your blood pressure by about 5 to 8 mm Hg if you have high blood pressure. 
Its important to be consistent because if you stop exercising, your blood pressure can rise again.
If you have elevated blood pressure, exercise can help you avoid developing hypertension. If you already have hypertension,
 regular physical activity can bring your blood pressure down to safer levels.

                    According to Medical Experts, Short-Time sleep, Sleeplessness, Stress may contribute to high blood pressure. 
More research is needed to determine the effects of chronic stress on blood pressure. Occasional stress also can contribute 
to high blood pressure if you react to stress by eating unhealthy food, drinking alcohol or smoking.
Take some time to think about what causes you to feel stressed, such as work, family, finances or illness. 
Once you know what's causing your stress, consider how you can eliminate or reduce stress.

Stopping smoking helps your blood pressure return to normal.

                    Acording to Medical Experts, Increase in Blood Sugar/glucose level is a great indication of diabetes.
High blood pressure (hypertension) can lead to many complications of diabetes, including diabetic eye disease and kidney 
disease, or make them worse. Most people with diabetes will eventually have high blood pressure, 
along with other heart and circulation problems. Diabetes damages arteries and makes them targets for hardening, 
called

                        atherosclerosis.

heart attack, and kidney failure.

                    in a terminal or Command prompt. This will 
become a problem when launching the application online because nodejs will go off once you close the termial. To mitigate 
this issue, I have to create an external environment variables files
                    <b>
                        .env
                    </b>
                    and then teweak Genomelink API Nodejs code to integrate the enviroment
 variables thus making it as part of the Genomelinks API.
