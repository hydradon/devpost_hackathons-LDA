                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;History shows us that people often make mistakes, they give wrong decisions, they vote for the wrong persons! And history also shows us that in the end they pay a heavy price for it!&rdquo; 
What inspired us to make this app is the fact that there is a lot of misinformation online about politicians so we decided to make an app that accurately represents their politicians beliefs and voting history on major issues that conners the American people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application acquires data from congress's database and analyzes and displays information about political representatives and also allows politicians to get an accurate feedback of what people's outlooks on critical topics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app by making a request to congress's database and getting voting records of politicians. Then we parsed and analyze given data using SwiftyJSON and Java JSON library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making requests to the API and deciding on the design details to simplify the information for the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a prototype of an app that could potentially revolutionize the way American voters educate themselves about their elected representatives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of data that is not concise for the general American people, and today we have the tools to resolve this issue and make an impact in our society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for We the People
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To continue developing more functionality on the app for Federal and State level politicians and contacting them to start using this app to interact with people.
