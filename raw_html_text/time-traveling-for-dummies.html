                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, I traveled back to 1776 to see Washington cross the Delaware. Bad idea &ndash; I nearly died of hypothermia since I, as a shorts-wearing Californian, was not prepared for the New England winter. Even worse, no shops would accept my $3 to buy Doritos!
                    <em>
                        They didn't even have Doritos!!!
                    </em>
                    Who could have possibly known this would happen?!? If only I had thought of those annoying details beforehand...
                </p>
                <h2>

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fueled by my anger that 1776 Delaware lacked Doritos, I retrieved and displayed historical data on my website with the WolframAlpha API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had difficulty figuring out how to handle and properly display the API data. I also struggled with constantly reminding myself of my humiliation after showing up to the Crossing of the Delaware in shorts and a t-shirt.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with WolframAlpha's API (well, any API) for the first time! Developing a website that solves a real, highly pressing problem!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to work with an API and how to parse through XML files. Also, I realized that Doritos didn't exist in the 1770s.
                </p>
