                    Inspiration - We wanted to build a website for an app we'd like to develop one day, we were inspired by J.P. Morgan's competition prompt to support women entrepreneurs
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - We built a website that promotes an app that will give support and resources to women entrepreneurs by allowing them to connect with each other and host events and share data, etc.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - we programmed a website using HTML and CSS
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - mostly debugging issues and project conception
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - the look of the website is better than we had hoped and we are really proud to have left this hackathon having actually built something
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - we taught ourselves HTML and CSS throughout the day and we learned what is involved in web development and what it is like to build your own website
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FemmeConnect - in the future we'd like to start work on the app itself - for now we're proud to have developed the concept and to have made a website that promotes the ideas behind the app
