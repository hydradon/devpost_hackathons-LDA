                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the likes of Kickstarter and Craigslist, we sought out to make an application that would help facilitate community-driven projects around the world and in our local communities. This app would let organizers create events where other users could browse both local and global efforts to make a difference in our community both near and far.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GoHelpMe is an app for connecting communities together to drive volunteer powered events. You are able to browse events, and click on them to view more information. Users can create an account to keep track of their projects. You can subscribe to any you'd like to participate in. You can also create events for others to participate in. Any user can view their attending and hosting events on their dashboard. They can also browse all the events going on across the world.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a MERN stack, which both hand advantages and weaknesses due to our varied experience with the software stack. However, it made it easy as we did not have to switch between languages when going from front-end to back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a few issues with the backend accepting inputs as well as react state synchronization. There are still a few rough bugs that are tough to track down. Overall the project has some polish, but is missing what would bring it to the professional level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented everything from scratch, using no libraries for user management or anything, which was both a benefit and a burden, since we had to write everything. However, we also had some shining moments, like when we got the map to work, which shows the user's position and the position of the event. Or when we finally got everything hooked up to the backend and could start finally seeing it come together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frameworks are hard, especially in the web development field, where the technology is evolving every day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GoHelpMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to refactor our authentication layer, and handle the user information better. Then we would smooth out our database relations and optimize our API usage. Finally we are going to see about how we can improve the experience on the front-end with our UI framework.
