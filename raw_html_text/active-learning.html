                    Teachers who move too quickly through material and assume everyone is on track because there have been no questions.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used css, javascript, and html to create multiple web pages that are connected. From the front page, one can go to the teachers' view page or the students'.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our most experienced hacker is proficient in java, but our idea meant using html, which none of the team members had experience with.

                <p>
                    I am proud of our team's ability to overcome frustration, learn a language in a few hours, and put together a more visual version of our idea.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned how to code using html and css.

                    What's next for Active Learning
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The plan is to eventually fulfill our original intent for Active Learning, getting it online. This would require implementing a data structure, probably a hashtable, to store usernames, passwords, and class sessions. This would also mean writing a script that takes submitted powerpoints and embeds them into each session.
