                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the Clarifai demonstration at the Opening Ceremony of SwampHacks, where we saw pictures being analyzed to produce recommended tags about them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moody Music suggests a song/ringtone based on your Facebook friends' profile pictures, allowing you to personalize your contacts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Facebook Graph API to retrieve the user's friends and their profile pictures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then used the Clarifai API to get the recommended tags for their picture. We created a list of the most commonly returned tags and assigned numerical values to them that helped us determine the 'mood' of the picture to generate song recommendations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We incorporated the Echo-Nest API and a self-created list of songs to generate a list of recommended songs for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble connecting our front-end with our back-end smoothly. None of us had used express.js before, so we weren't sure how to get it working.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble with AJAX requests initially, but mentors were able to help us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into some hurdles with the Graph API from Facebook as well as the Clarifai API, but we figured those out with some help from the mentors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our initial plan was to put together a multi-platform app using the Ionic Framework, but we weren't able to set it up properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get the functionality of the application working (the API calls and the final song recommendations).
We also created a simple, stylish UI using Bootstrap and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to incorporate multiple APIs within a single project to get our desired results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to retrieve JSON objects from URLs using JQuery and parse the JSON object to get the desired 
results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to customize Bootstrap, adding our own pictures and CSS to suit our purpose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Moody Music
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step would be to create a multi-platform app using Ionic, making our application widely available to users, and allowing us to easily and effectively integrate our back-end with the app's user interface.
