                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made this app for visually-impaired people who have trouble determining whether if a food product is fresh or not without physically analyzing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses object recognition to determine if a food product is fresh or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was made on Android Studio (Java) using Open CV.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app isn't able to run as we made everything from scratch and couldn't make it run at the final time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Object &amp; Image Recognition Android Application
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll be able to make this run and hopefully, upload it to the Play Store with a motive to help visually-impaired people around the world.
