                <p>
                    From the very nature of singaporean 'kiasuness', we help to punish those who dare to break the trust.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SmarTissue will help users to 'chope' their favourite table at a nearby food store. This is done through Telegram bot which will help the user to 'chope' with an easy and noob-friendly telegram bot interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have the input sensor such as PIR motion sensor, and output devices such as LCD screens, piezzo buzzer, etc. These are attached to the Arduino Uno board which then is connected to Espresso Lite v2.0 which has wifi module (ESP8266). The wifi module is then used to talk with our Telegram bot which interfaces with the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges as we have much more interesting ideas that was limited by the design, hardware and connectivity limitations. The raw sensors output were hard to process as it's capabilities are limited. The connections between boards and Telegram was a challenge especially when we have to change the board from what we originally planned. 
Many of us have to learn and pick up new skills/languages just to be able to code the scripts and work with the hardware.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to stay motivated and finish our project, given the ever changing ideas and having to restart over and over again due to change of hardware/ backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we've learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnt to work around tight deadlines especially when a final working product is required at such a short time.
we have learnt to work together, breaking big problems into smaller ones and delegating it to each members according to our forte.

                    What's next for SmarTissue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SmarTissue's future will be include its own application as to give the user more control and friendlier UI to navigate. It will also be able to add more useful features such as counting the amount of tissue left on each box. Whole process of booking seats will be streamlined and enforce rules/punctuality so that the community can benefit from SmarTissue.
We look forward to SmarTissue being adopted in more places.
