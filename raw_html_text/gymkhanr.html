                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes people have a bad time guessing what will be a good present for someone or making funny activities, so we decided to give a tool to make these tasks easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gymkhanr lets people chose between being an organizer or a participant of what we called a Gymkhana. An organizer is able to create a gymkhana and then create as many tests as he wants. There are two kind of tests: Questions and Challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can pass a Challenge introducing the right code, which you can get by doing some funny activities such as going to a certain place, doing some awkward stuff, ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Question is exactly like it sounds, you have to choose the correct answer of many possible given answers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed Gymkhanr using Django framework, which involves the Python language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never done anything neither with django nor python, so we had to learn how to work with these.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to put both types of tests in only one template using Django forms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the syntax of python and how difficult is to work a bunch of people in the same project coordinately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gymkhanr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We planned to add more type of challenges and to improve the interface.
