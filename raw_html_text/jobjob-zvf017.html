                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We we're frustrated with current recruitment processes from both sides: emphatisizing both the recruiter and the applicant. The recruitment process is completely broken: Recruitment agencies bill a humongous 420 billion US$ in sales annually and the avg. time to hire is 12 weeks (25% of a year) from posting the job with finding the candidate pool, interviewing and qualifying eating the lion share of time
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we ran intoMicrosoft's Machine Learning, we saw an opportunity and cheerfully questioned our existence: How would Aliens tackle recruiting, a 100 years from now?
                </p>
                <p>
                    JobJob was born.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JobJob makes job search easygoing. We're building easy, integrable and smart web tools for recruitment agencies, HR managers and CEO's alike, who want to take their recruitment efforts into the 31st century. (yes you read right, 31st century). This is alien recruitment, after all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're building an app that enables job applicants to swipe job posts right and left created by recruiters. For recruiters we enable smart search, ranking, categorization and sorting of applicants through keyword, machine learning and algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to target our tool to Recruitment agencies at first, since our front-end works at one and we have key insight on the industry; we want to enable them to increase their value through us. Plus the business and the industry is big enough.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trello + Coffee + GitHub + coding 12h/day.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For example we ran into questions like:
Where to focus with a limited time-frame?
                    <br>
                    How can we make two systems speak with each other? How can we enable semi open-source integrations?
How to pitch to investors? 
How to validate an idea? You need to validate them all the time.
How to prioritize? How to setup tasks and deadlines? How to stay focused?
How to find your own errors from your code and continuously keep learning?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always be learning is the motto at JobJob.

                <p>
                    Especially the Alien logo and our brand we built during this weekend. It's fun, playful and smart: JobJob. 
Building the grounding structure for our web app

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can easily get stuck in coding. It's important that different systems speak with each other. It never hurts to pitch your idea - you get valuable feedback. Always be testing and always be learning.
