                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A childhood animated TV series based on space themed storyline involving superhuman football players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Football team manager simulator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've split the work into design, front-end, middleware, backend. One of the team members thought of the game mechanics, one came up with the algorithm for the scoring of the matches, another built the databases and then we integrated all our separate components into a final project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking Python to our MySQL database was rather though and learning javascript for the first time was challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making fully randomized teams with players that have completely random stats which impact the game through an algorithm based on character's strength and winning probabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with complex databases and how to tackle a game, by thinking about lots of game mechanics.
                </p>

                    What's next for Galactik Hackball
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a visual representation of each player's profile and expanding the storyline.
