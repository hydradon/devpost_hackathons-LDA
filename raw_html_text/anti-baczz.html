                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love the way antibiotics target and attack bacteria, ultimately protecting our body from any type of diseases. So, on that thought, we developed a game which will illustrate the way our antibiotics stays all the time awake killing the entering bacteria. We have also kept health packs which will increase the potential of the antibiotic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is one -player continuous game. In that a triangular shooting bot is placed in the middle, which is motile, it represents the anti-biots. This shooting antibiotic shoots out certain chemical laser balls that target and attack the green nasty bacteria. We also have intermediate chances of heath pack which will increase the potential of the antibiotic effects on the bacteria. As you succeed, the level becomes harder and more harmful bacteria enters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of two biology students with two IT student. The bio people did the whole concept building while the IT developed the Game part using Visual Studio Code and Language used is HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and JQuery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of error can in while developing in the whole gaming system. The main thing we probably faced was understanding the each-others' field of course. This was faced while doing meet-ups, working and interactive discussion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having to meet different people with various knowledge related to their course fields. The best part is the working, the work explained how important interdisciplinary is, for developing the overall project we have till now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have no words to explain how much we have learned through this whole challenge. The bio people exchanged knowledge with the IT, while the IT with the bio. Widening our knowledge spectrum, making us elaborate with our ideas, the next time this type of challenges come we'll be ever ready to collaborate again with possibly more people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Anti-Baczz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know want this game to become a multi-player game where many players will represent certain antibiotic, like ampicillin, penicillin, etc. Making the game more interactive not only to the game itself but with people who they will meet while playing. So, it becomes a game-collaboration hub.
