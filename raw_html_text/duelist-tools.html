                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My love for all things Yu-Gi-Oh!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a application that keeps track of your life points and your opponent's life points as well as giving you a digital dice and coin for cards that require you to roll a die or flip a coin.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First I spent about two weeks deciding what exactly I wanted in an application for Yu-Gi-Oh! Then I worked out what I could do and what couldn't be done as well as things that would take a long time do. Finally, I just came to the Hackathon at Florida Polytechnic University and just started to work on the code.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java doesn't have global variables and my own typos.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Getting as far as I did in the 24 hours of this hackathon.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That when I do set my mind to something with programming I can do it well.
