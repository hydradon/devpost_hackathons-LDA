                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pokemon GO is a big inspiration, there is a large untapped market for augmented reality games especially with recent advancements in computer vision
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allowed you to take photos of palm trees, fire extinguishers, squirrels and other exotic objects. These photos allow you to check off items in your scavenger hunt checklist. You can share checklists to challenge your friends, and completion is tracked as you find each object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An android app takes the photo and ships the data to Google's Vision API. They return a response with what Google thinks is in the image, and we use that to decide what to check off on your list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having never developed an android app before, we had no idea what we were doing. It was an uphill battle to put together this app but ultimately worked out well. We faced plenty of struggles with merge conflicts especially while working on so many interrelated features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to build our first app in just 24 hours seems like an accomplishment to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create activities, store data using Room, create a camera intent, submit an api request to Google's vision api and many other intricacies of building an android app.
We also learned how to merge things more effectively in git. Using a merge tool like meld really takes the load off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Scavvy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we plan to polish off some of the rough edges and possibly add a few new features. Unfortunately, using google's vision api is a bit too expensive to make this a free app.
