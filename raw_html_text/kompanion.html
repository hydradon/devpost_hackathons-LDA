                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main inspiration was our desire to try new technologies that we had heard of or used before on a smaller scale to create useful, aesthetically-pleasing, and interactive software that can be scalable and applicable for different devices to solve complex technological problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kompanion is a technological solution to a challenge presented by Konfio company. The objective of this project to create an intuitive, user-friendly, on-the-go application that can be reliable for fast, easily-accessible, yet detailed data analysis and visualization for users in the business sphere. It can be presented both on a website and an iOS mobile application solution. It is hosted and connected to Google Cloud Services to restrict and protect access to possibly sensitive data while improving the scalability of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to develop the website's user interface, we used Angular and node.js, and for the iOS application, we used Swift and Objective-C. We used Google Cloud Service to store a MySQL Database with information relevant to the user. We also developed an API to access our databank and make it accessible to other servers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to make our solution more secure, we wanted to use the cloud. While doing so, we failed to publish it on tow different providers until we accomplished it with Google Cloud Platform. Also, the database we were using had some issues at first, such as being able to hook it up to a cloud service, but we accomplished to solve them. Incorporating graphs into our app and webpage turned out to also be a challenge since it was something that we had not really tried doing before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create two different products for two widely different environments, while also managing to preserve Konfio's brand, style and feel within them. We improved the overall security of our products by relying on technology that has prebuilt and tested firewalls and communication protocols, adding additional value to our creations. Another important accomplishment is that we managed to include a touch ID verification to the iOS App, using native functionalities of the devices to complement our design. Also, we successfully managed to set up Azure instances and a CI/CD pipeline for autonomous builds, releases, and deployments of the web application, though because of time constraints we opted to do the demo with Google Cloud Services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is in fact possible to create such complex projects in such a small amount of time given the right technological tools and motivation. Communication, task distribution, and teamwork are essential for projects of this magnitude to be successful. Also, in a more technical note, we got the opportunity to experience and play with a little bit of different cloud and hosting platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Services, so we got a better perspective about the specific benefits that each company offers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kompanion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to implement a dashboard where you could rapidly access your most important tabs in the application, but unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were not able to do it. We would love to continue developing this tool and add even more functionalities and possibilities for data analysis like those offered by PowerBI or by implementing Machine Learning algorithms. Also, since we were not able to develop an app for Android devices, that could be in our future plans to create a more universal experience for users with all types of technology.
