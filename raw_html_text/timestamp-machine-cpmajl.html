                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever needed to review one small portion of an hours-long lecture on YouTube, but can't find the part you're looking for? Use the Timestamp Machine extension to go back in time and retrieve the information you need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Timestamp Machine is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to search through and navigate the content of a video. Using Ctrl+Shift+F (or by simply clicking the extension), you can find all appearances of your keyword and iterate through them in the video as it's playing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension was built using JavaScript, HTML, and the YouTube API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As no one on the team had significant JavaScript experience before, it was definitely a challenge to learn the language and then implement the extension using it. The development process involved a lot of debugging and reading up on documentation to familiarize ourselves with the tools we were using.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though we were unable to finish implementing the full functionality that we had planned, we're proud of the structure that we managed to build. The foundations are definitely there to develop the project into a fully-realized product. We're also proud that we created a concept that we would all genuinely use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of JavaScript and gained a better understanding of the YouTube API and APIs in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Timestamp Machine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we'd like to further develop the Timestamp Machine so that it is not only limited to utilizing user-uploaded subtitles, but can also function using auto-generated captions. We'd also like to expand it to function on other streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+.
