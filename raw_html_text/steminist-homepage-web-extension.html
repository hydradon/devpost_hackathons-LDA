                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted an easily accessible display of updated news and information for women in STEM to stay inspired.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When installed as a Chrome web extension, it sets your new tab page to the women-in-STEM-themed dashboard we designed. This displays the time and date, a twitter feed of daily articles about women in STEM, a randomized inspirational quote from a powerful woman in STEM, and links to resources and organizations for women in STEM.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a manifest.json, html file, css style sheet, and javascript to create the web extension, then tested it by installing it on our own Chrome browsers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us were beginners with web design and HTML, so we had to learn from scratch! Javascript was also unfamiliar to most of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We taught ourselves new skills with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and met some other powerful female hackers from around the country!
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to make it more customizable, so each woman can design it to fit her interests.
