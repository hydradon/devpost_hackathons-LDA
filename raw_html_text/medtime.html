                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personal friend who had a 8" cut on his scalp and had to wait for over 4 hours to get treated, if we knew that was the timeframe we could have went to the next hospital that was 20 minutes down the street and gotten treatment earlier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reduce the workload and wait time when patients are injured, therefore avoiding more damage
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ruby on Rails with a PostgreSQL backend, hosted on Heroku
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiple Hospital systems and operations having different formats, privacy laws and information shared to outsiders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    redistributing the heavy patient load from one hospital and reducing the errors from not overloading the doctors/ surgeons with all these patients, therefore providing a less stressful environment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a need for this type of efficiency incase emergency and additional opportunities'/ inefficiencies that exist in this field that could use additional innovation to better service patients and save additional lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MedTime
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coordinate with hospitals and start developing prototypes of operational system and distribution of patients incase of disastrous events and the growing population
