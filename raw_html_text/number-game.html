                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is based on a french tv show called "des chiffres et des lettres" which has multiple games, but the number one is similar to this Alexa skill. (on the tv show the game is much harder)
Last year wanted to make an Alexa skill and it seemed like a game that could be played on Alexa
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    for an example game, Alexa could say:
-&gt; Your numbers are 3 8 9. And you have to reach 15
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        3 x 8
-&gt; that's 24, what's your next operation?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        24 - 9
-&gt; Well done, you found the answer!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You can use in Skill purchase to buy a mode with harder game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built using the Alexa SDK for node.js, lambda for the endpoint. everything is deployed using the CLI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was written using version one of the node.js SDK. the first phase was to rewrite this skill to use v2.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The random game generator is quite interesting, it creates balanced games that are not too easy or too hard
