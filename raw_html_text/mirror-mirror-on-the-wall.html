                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It bothers me to no end when I need to use a mirror and must resort to my phone, because I know I am about to be humiliated...lol. When my camera is in selfie mode, when it turns on I am often ashamed by what I see. My goal is to end this torture for myself and all of humanity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app shows you a mirror image of yourself, by utilizing the built in  feature of HTML5
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to learn Azure today, so most of my time was spent building a web app through the Azure Portal. Once that was online, I began basic styling with HTML and CSS. Then, I added JavaScript functionality and finished up by fine-tuning the CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, I was doing a speech recognition app, but was unsuccessful with cross-browser compatibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm much more comfortable with Azure now. It was great to be with other developers and to learn from them. This event was well organized and I made some great friends. Also, I think my app is cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like I said, learning the basic ins and outs of Azure was a big accomplishment. I had never auto-initialized the webcam before, so that was fun.
