                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the recent Sonoma Fires, Ryan (our team lead) discovered that volunteers within his Alumni network are willing to help. He sent an email via listserv to 10K alumni with 2 Google forms, returned 230 offers of assistance and 120 offers of temporary housing for 10 displaced alumni

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used API.ai (DialogFlow) to create our conversational flow, presented through Facebook messenger (front end) and Firebase was used to store the volunteer response data (on food and shelter). We also used BetterDoctor API to get a list of doctors around a given zip code.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To create a working prototype in 24 hours (but we did IT)!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a live prototype as well as our super cohesive team that compliment each others skills!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Help Emerge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will integrate pharmacy dispensary features (as many state pharmacy boards instituted a disaster protocol that allows pharmacists to dispense medicines without prescriptions). We hope to expand further to integrate accelerometer data for identification of strokes, AMI, trauma at the site of disaster and elsewhere.
