                    High blood pressure impacts 1 in 3 U.S. adults, costing $46 billion a year in related costs. It is also linked with various other illnesses, including heart disease, which is the number one killer of men and women in the U.S., costing $320 billion in related costs.

                    HeartSense is a real-time, continuous, user friendly heart-rate and blood pressure monitor requiring only a smartphone camera and related app. The related app can then securely store and/or transfer a user&rsquo;s data on the cloud.

                    HeartSense is an ideal technology for elder-care, home-care, telehealth and those who require frequent heart-rate and blood pressure monitoring, but may not have access to or difficulty with traditional technology and care. It also has potential for commercial consumer use for those who wish to monitor their heart-rate and blood pressure for exercise related purposes.

                    HeartSense has 12 patents, 15 peer-reviewed publications and won three innovation awards. It has been used successfully in Singapore and we are in the early stages of piloting our remote monitoring capabilities with a U.S. care provider with 28+ facilities serving 2500+ elders, linking collected data to their existing EHR.
