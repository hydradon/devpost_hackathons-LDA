                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of time extra time is spent in trying to determine if a person is in danger.

                    Pre-Alerts your emergency contact(s) if you do not reach an expected destination in time, or if your phone is not reachable past a certain deadline.

                    <li>
                        Nexmo to send SMS alerts to emergency contacts, rather than expect every emergency contact to install the same or a sister tracking app

                    <li>
                        Collect encrypted data and upon any incident, send it to a trusted contact who has the decryption key and/or law enforcement

                    <li>
                        Could be useful to those who fear their lives might be in danger, e.g. victims of domestic abuse, whistleblowers, and journalists under oppressive regimes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use ArcGIS with spatial data on how "dangerous" areas can be, e.g. low signal strength, or high crime rates, and automatically start collecting data
