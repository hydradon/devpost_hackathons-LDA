                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our aim was to create a tool to aid non-native English speakers in their learning of the English language.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads in a short story - with very simple syntax - and generates comprehension questions for the user to test his/her knowledge and understanding of what he/she read.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We take in a text file and parse it into arrays of arrays of strings, each inner array representing a sentence. We then create a lexicon which uses a non-binary tree, with each node being referenced by a character, to store words efficiently. A word is stored in this tree if you can follow a path down through the tree in the order of the characters in the word. In these trees, we store different types of words. We then parse in a file, and then use the lexicons to generate questions and answers for the sentences.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with parsing, and had trouble with the GUI components.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data structures can support large extensions of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enhanced our ability to parse data trees.
