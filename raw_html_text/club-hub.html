                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a task faced by students in our everyday lives, how our school collects and stores information on events and clubs. For larger schools, it is incredibly inefficient to store all this information on paper or on multiple different platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Club Hub is an easy solution to the problem of easy access and registration for clubs. It allows users to create an admin or student accounts. With an admin account, you can create clubs under their school, and with a student account, you can sign up for different clubs. On Club Hub, students can have access to all the club's information including the email, president, advisor, and description.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a web application using a Python Flask backend, along with HTML and CSS/Javascript to style the webpages. In the Python file, we created each route that returned an HTML file, additionally, we were able to pass variables down into HTML files using the Flask framework which allowed us to create dynamic webpages.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some accomplishments we are proud of include creating an efficient and accessible web application, designing an aesthetic display, and incorporating deep learning with our searchbar function. Our overall web application addressed the problems we sought to solve at the beginning of this project. We were also able to combine CSS and Javascript to create the final displayed webpage. The last unique feature of our project was the searchbar based on deep learning that searched through the list of current clubs and ordered them based on relevance to the keywords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the course of this project, we learned how to use Firebase and Python Flask to create a working web application. We also learned how to effectively train our neural network for the search function, using 5 different hidden layers. Working with CSS to create the website also taught us important designing and layout skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Club Hub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envision Club Hub as not just a platform for clubs, but also for all other school social events such as dances, sports, fundraisers, and more. The design of Club Hub makes it simple to create accounts, accommodate many users, and register for the same shared event. In the future, Club Hub could be used for a variety of different purposes other then just clubs.
