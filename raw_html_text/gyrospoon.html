                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patients with this condition have a difficult time eating with regular utensils and the current products on the market are very expensive. This device provides the service to the user at a much more affordable price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This device uses the gyroscopic sensor and accelerometer to dictate the position of the device after calibration. Using the data received from the sensors, the servo motors move in real time to negate any movement. This allows the spoon to stabilize helping the user enjoy their meal!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Using the Arduino microprocessors connected to the different sensors, information was constantly sent back and forth between the sensors and the motors to negate any movement made by the user to create a stable spoon.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The calibration process was the most challenging as it was time-consuming as well as very complicated to implement.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The world is a very shaky place, with a lot of hurdles, but on the plus side, at least our design can stabilize food and help people at the same time.
