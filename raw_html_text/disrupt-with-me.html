                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've been going to TechCrunch Disrupt nearly ever year since it launched, and presented a new hack at the hackathon. We realized people often need a ride to and from an event but there is no tool to coordinate this. So we thought we'd throw together a tool that takes caree of it almost A to Z.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Disrupt With Me shows all the Disrupt events going on. Browse, see who is going, RSVP, and invite people to go with you. Make a profile. Add people to your contacts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And it also lets you offer rides and request a ride to and from the events. You indicate locations and times and the app does the rest. It intelligently matches people based on how long it would take to pick someone up. It almost gives you the full Uber experience, with a map!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The open source Qbix Platform that our company built over the years (
                    <a href="https://github.com/Qbix/Platform" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/Qbix/Platform
                    </a>
                    ) allows us - and anyone else - to quickly put together a social app like this during a hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Websites can't track geolocation when in the background, so after you're done using GPS you have to manually switch back to the website on your phone. We hope to fix this by releasing a native app in the future, after the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Qbix Platform!! It allows anyone to put together apps like this quickly. Instead of reinventing the wheel it solves thousands of issues for the developer, letting them focus on just the functionality of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Things always take longer as possible

                    What's next for Disrupt With Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would be happy to work with TechCrunch to release a far more customized and branded native app in the store for future TechCrunch Disrupt events! We also want to build stuff like this for other conferences.
