                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a major gap between what people make and how comfortable they live. Naturally, the cost of living is always increasing and the salary rates of most people cannot compete with this change. That's why we decided to tackle the idea head-on by creating an application that helps people find better housing for what they're making.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WCIL is a crowd-sourced, serverless, web application that takes input from a user based on what salary range they are currently receiving, the city they are currently in, the level of comfort they are living in, and how happy they are. Using this, the user can also look at the interactive map and see what areas are good for living in with their set salary from other users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a Node.js serverless cloud architecture to help users find their ideal home based on their income and the rating of comfort and happiness the area has. We used Google Firestore as our non-relational database to store all of the user inputs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Discovering how to work with serverless architecture, asynchronous javascript and google cloud platform navigating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That it works! We completed our idea to the fullest potential that we thought we could and it turned out great!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a whole lot while completing this project. For some of us, it was a new learning experience with Node.js and Google Cloud Serverless Architecture. With that being said, the best skill we could've picked up from this was coordination and teamwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Where can I live?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we are hoping to add upvote features for certain areas, security improvements, and an API for machine learning.
