                    What is the problem?
American teens in the USA today are unaware of police brutality and how it affects them, as well as how often it occurs in their area to people just like them. We plan to create both a game and website to help solve this problem. We are going to raise awareness as to what exactly police brutality is and how it ties into racial profiling. Both the game and website will supply users with facts regarding police brutality along with racial profiling. The game is to engage teens into the topic of police brutality; it is generally viewed as an "overhyped" topic by teens. The website will go more in-depth and better speak on the topic and inform people of what is going on.

                    PITCH:
I want everyone in here to think about whether or not they have ever been brutalized by the police as a result of racial profiling. I personally have not experienced such injustices, but people around me have, and I actually fear the possibility of it happening to me on a daily basis. My group wishes to tackle police brutality based on racial profiling because it does happen often and is not "overhyped" as some people our age would describe it. We want to raise awareness and get people involved in local groups and organizations to help try and solve the problem. So we've created both a game and a website to assist.
At the end: Just think, it could be you next.
