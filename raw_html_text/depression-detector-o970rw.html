                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people in the community are suffering from depression. Unfortunately many of them are not aware of the symptoms which leads to suicidal attempts. Many times, the signals are there, but there is either no one to notice, or people are not paying close enough attention.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding API we analyze text messages for Sentiment, as well as Emotion, using paradigm shifts in lexical patterns as an early warning system, sending an email with this data to a specified person of confidence.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was primarily written in JavaScript, taking advantage of the easy to use node.js,and API provided by IBM for sentiment analysis, as well as its many server-side capabilities to let us run data analytics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably the most challenging aspect of this project was picking a good server-side language that would allow us for much flexibility, a well a forwards compatibility in terms of API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this is first hackathon, we  are excited and created this project. This is our first hackathon project which made us proud and motivate us to do more hackathons like this.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work as a team and collaborate and share ideas to build a project.

                    What's next for Depression Detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would be a daemon on Android that would integrate with various messaging apps, as well as a browser plugin analyzing search parameters.
