                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to development an application for the Myo armband and take advantage of its features. A paint application was a perfect idea as it made use of both arm movement and gestures.

                    Make a

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Myo Connect application to use the Myo as the cursor and register the
                    <strong>
                        fist
                    </strong>
                    gesture as a hold until released left click
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used the java.awt and swing to implement the graphics. The java application tracks the cursor and draws when the fist gesture is selected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we also utilized maven with the Java Myo library as a dependency communicate with the armband to check for other gestures and perform other functionalities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of difficulties trying to implement our custom cursor control using the gyroscope and accelerometer. In the end, we decided to use the Myo Connect application to map the cursor for us and just use the cursor input instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to use the Myo Java library to connect the Myo with our application. We also managed to read the gestures using the library and perform operations with them. Moreover, we created a paint program which allowed us to paint with different brush sizes and colours.

                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how the java graphics library works, how to use the Myo library, and how to multi-thread the program.
