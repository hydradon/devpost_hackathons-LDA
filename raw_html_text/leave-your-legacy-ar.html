                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a way to look back 20, 30, or even 50 years and see what it was like to live in the past. We wanted to view these post overlaying buildings and see the history through the eyes of the people, and most importantly the longevity of these posts must go on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leave your legacy allows user to post a test post only at your current GPS location. The whole map is synchronized across users, allowing for a unique interaction between local Leave Your Legacy users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript and google maps api to develop a simple map interface, and Django/Python for backend requests and SQLite for storing latitude and longitude.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems getting AR to work in a web browser because there's not much library support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we've successfully allowed user to post at their location, and our website is database backed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about friendship, walking in the rain, and that Manny is a terrible father.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Leave Your Legacy AR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Leave Your Legacy is to be able to leave images in addition to text, and also being able to comment of posts of another user.
