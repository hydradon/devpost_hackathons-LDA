                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that would provide users an easy, simple way of reducing their energy and resource waste. We believe that as society continues to develop more and more new technology, we should also be aware of environmental concerns and making our technology more sustainable.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ReHabit lets the user input events such as when they would leave the house for work and send individualized reminders to reduce waste by things such as, turning off the lights, turning off the water, and adjusting the temperature.

                    Android Studio.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to effectively use Android Studio, Java, and XML. We were first time users of Android Studio and most of our team had no prior experience with Java and XML.
