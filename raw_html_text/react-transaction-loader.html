                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no idea what project to make, but then just decided on this
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows the if the transaction is being mined or finished being mined.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Reactjs and CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used websockets and the etherscan api to check if a transaction has been mined, but there was no way to test it easily on the testnet because the websocket etherscan api is only for the mainnet.
                </p>
