                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that ergonomic and aesthetically looking lamps on the market are expensive and relatively hard to use. We decided to change this with "The Orb"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lights up a warm yellow/orange color that doesn't hurt your eyes and is fully portable with wireless charging which allows for little to no wires needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is mostly built with hardware such as Arduino Nano, gyro sensors, led strips, and wireless charging coils.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our LED strips weren't functioning properly and were not turning on automatically unless we physically moved the wires around and improved the connection. However after hard work and research we were able to solve this problem. Another issue we came across figuring out the gyro sensor and allowing the movement of the Z axis of the sensor to increase brightness. We had to go through different problem solving techniques including trial an error in order to understand what was going wrong within our code.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest accomplishment we had was actually solving all the problems we came across and being able to create and program exactly what we planned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use gyro sensors and LED strips and how to integrate programs into hardware applications which are vital for real world applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Orb
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to allow for more RGB capabilities in order to change the lights from warm colors to like full ROYGBIV colours to make it more interesting and cool for a variety of different buyers and age groups.
