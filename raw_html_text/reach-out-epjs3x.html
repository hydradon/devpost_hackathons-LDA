                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We, the team, have had friends who were utterly brilliant, always smiling, being the light in friend groups while sadly silently suffering away and the only time we got to know about their suffering was when it was already too late for us to act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we have experienced in our lives has pushed us to participate in this very challenge because people should know that there is help out there for them, that they deserve the help, that they are not a burden to society and that they are deeply loved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is this big stigma in society about mental health issues and people, specially students like us, are scared or not aware of how to reach out for help.
This invisible disability,
                    <strong>
                        Depression
                    </strong>
                    , is one that keeps taking people away from us without us being able to do much about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We think we are fine, we think that it is just a phase but in reality a huge percentage of students are silently suffering from Depression without anyone in their surroundings knowing about it. These people live with a mask in society while they are silently dying inside. Depression affects their lives massively without them realising it. Their studies, their relationships with friends and families, their mental and physical health are heavily impacted from it and people are still afraid of reaching out and talking about it because they are so scared of being categorised as weak or of being treated as an outcast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you google around about suicide attempts, you'll notice that the most common thoughts of those people before attempting it is that they feel that nobody cares.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where we step in.
We want to tackle this mental illness by helping people before they are driven to a point of no return.
We want to use the idea of frequent positive reinforcements through an app to keep up with a users' emotions and to keep up with their mental health and to encourage them to reach out when matters are getting too tough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are in no way creating an app to replace professional help, but rather an app that acts as a bridge towards getting help.
For the moment, we are just writing this app to help students because this is what we are.
The app uses the idea of positive reinforcements on a regular basis to help the user feel a bit better.
At the very beginning we use a short normal survey to find out a bit about the user and then we follow up with bigger questions to go a bit more in depth and all this info is fed up into a mini database on which the APIs from the cognitive services from Azure act on to get a very clear idea of how the situation is and we base that on a scale of 0-10.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app has default settings of sending a small notification every 4 hours to the person to check if they are doing okay and it also send a small positive message to hopefully improve their mood.
The user can go into settings and change a lot of things such as, they can change the time interval at which they get those messages.
We also added a special feature where the user can select some of his favorite animals and choose if they want to get pictures and videos. What this exactly does is that, whenever the user taps on the notification message, they are greeted into the app with a cute image of a small animal or a short funny video of the animal. 
We all love small fuzzy dogs or cats doing funny, innocent things. So our plan with this feature was to just bring a little smile on the person's face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also implemented some more serious features- voice recording and notes.
We encourage the user to write a little note about how they felt recently, but as we all know- writing on a smartphone can be very draining sometimes and for a depressed person, this might feel too big of a step to take.
So we added the ability to record short voice notes of their feelings.
Here, we implemented an API provided by the cognitive services by Azure which is Speech-to-text so that the person could choose if they wanted to have their voice notes converted into text afterwards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We now have the data of how the person is feeling, but what do we do with it?
We just use another API from Azure ;)
Here, we used the text analytics. So what it does is pretty simple, it goes through the text and pretty much finds out how the person is doing based on what he wrote or recorded. In the end, we get a result based on a scale of 1-10 about how good or bad the person is feeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also implementing a small selfie feature where the user can take a small selfie of their face in the app and it runs the emotion recognition API from the cognitive services to find out how the person is doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the bad times, we also encourage them to reach out to friends and families.
We added a small feature where you can select contacts that you can call during those bad times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All this information about the text, the recordings and the selfies are saved into a mini database and we run an AI on it to find out how good or bad the person is doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the answer, we send more/less positive reinforcing messages, show more/less pictures/videos and ask often/less times if they are doing fine.
Since we know that it is hard to dial a friend during a depressed phase and talk about it, we implemented another feature that ask if you want to talk to a friend and then the app shows the list of friends that the user previously marked. All the user has to do then is to tap on a name and the app will dial that person. This might not seem like such a big feature but for a depressed person, it might just be what they need- to be shown that they have friends who they can
                    <strong>
                        Reach out
                    </strong>
                    to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like we said before, the app is not a replacement for professional help.
When the app finds out that the person is doing really bad or have intentions of hurting themselves in any way- an alert pops up on the screen and it shows "Do you want to call the Krisendienst?".
If the user taps on yes, a call to the krisendienst is immediately placed so that the person is a step further to getting professional help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why we say that our app acts like a bridge to get professional help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started coding the app with very simple loops until we realised that the API provided by the cognitive services of Azure fit perfectly for what we are tackling.
So we downloaded Xcode and started making the interfaces for the app which was quite easy to complete and then we just downloaded the APIs from Azure and implemented them in the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, none of us in the group had any experience with Xcode so we took quite some while learning how to use it with the help of youtube. We got a lot of troubles with the APIs because we are still trying to make everything work perfectly with the data bank.
We have had bugs/errors pretty much everywhere and our knowledge of frameworks is very low, so to implement everything is still a huge challenge because we started with basically no real knowledge of anything apart from knowing a bit of Swift.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Group work. It's amazing how we were able to work as a team since we did not know each other beforehand.
We had no idea that such APIs on AI are available to us freely and we were completely amazed at how powerful and accurate they are. Having had friends who went through major phases of depression, we felt like we were really making a step forward to changing so many lives.
