                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind the project was primarily due to the desire to work with the google home minis. It also was due to all of the team members' past experience in finding gifts for others that we felt we could attempt to implement this with the Google Home Mini.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is able to take in data inputted by the user regarding a particular person, and later on determine and give recommendations to the user.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team used actions on Google to setup the Google assistant and the files. Using dialogflow and coding in javascript, the team was able to modify and create the required responses as well as prompts for the user.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge that we ran into was adjusting to the environment of Google Actions and the dialogflow. Luckily, we were able to find a tutorial and other resources that helped me in improving my knowledge.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud in completing the voice commands for the project overall because this was the first time we ever took on such a task and we were able to learn a lot about the different stages in setting up the voice commands and working with Google Assistant.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the structure system (intent's, entities) used with Google Actions and dialogflow and the importance of each little thing when building the file.

                    The next steps for Dr. Gifter is to sort out any bugs that remain in the current existing version.
