                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I was little, I primarily used a Nokia. At that time, my life was without games like LoL, Mario Kart. All I can play is my Nokia phone. And Snake and Tetris were the only options. Since the theme is a bit of "retro", I decided to make some retro games but with some modern elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a snake game. After opening the website, you may see a 3D stadium (Franklin Field of the University of Pennsylvania). You can adjust the angle that you are comfortable with. By default, the stadium has a satellite layout. You can choose to use a plain layout. By clicking the "start button" you'll enjoy this old game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I firstly download WebStorm as I began to code HTML. But I'm a beginner in HTML, so I decided to experiment the programs on repl.it. I read some open source code and I understood the rule of Snake game. I also tried to find something interesting about Google cloud and I found google maps interesting. So the Snake and Google combined!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a team of 4 in the beginning and we were about to work on a Tetris game. But my teammates left me. So I've worked independently in the past 22 hours and learned an entirely new computer language. At the end of the hackathon, I didn't how to eliminate the circle, or the snake's tail, created by google maps. I read through the google cloud documentary and tried to find answers on StackOverflow. Finally, I fixed it by using a method to set the circle invisible
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a new language. I built two websites. And I learned how DNS works at the application level. But the most fun part is reading through google cloud documentary. Besides, while mapping the stadium, I spent hours in calculating longitudes and attitudes. I successfully used my trigonometry skills learned from middle school
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never formally coded HTML, js, or CSS prior to this hackathon. During this hackathon, I built two domains and built two websites. My programming is the combination of using w3 schools and experimenting on repl.it. I've had 4 different versions of games and three of them failed. Especially at the end of the hackathon, I had no idea how to eliminate the snake's tail after it moves. Since I was using Google could, the language is completely different from online tutorials. After reading through the documents, I solve the problem. I learned that there's a method called pop() in js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 3D Snake Game on Google Maps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll finish up the Tetris module and add more maps. But most importantly, I'll learn more about website building, HTML, js, CSS and Google clouds.
