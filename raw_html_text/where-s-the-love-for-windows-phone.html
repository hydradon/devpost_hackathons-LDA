                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a Windows Phone user for nearly 3 years, I've noticed that Windows Phone doesn't currently share the amount of vital apps that iOS and Android users enjoy. I became inspired to know that by becoming a Windows Phone Developer, I can assist in bringing SnapChat, TeamSpeak, Discord, and other application Windows Phone users are dying to have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a button that changes a String's content from " " to "Hello World" underneath the button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    XMAL is similar to XML when I designed very basic tutorial applications on Android, so defining a Button object and giving it attributes seemed second nature. With a small grasp of C#, I managed to change the String's content with the Button's Click Method.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was setting up my Nokia Lumia 920 for development. While I was used to Android's quick plug-and-development, I had to figure out certain reasons why my Nokia Lumia 920 wasn't being detected by the registration tool while the computer had immediately recognized it as Windows Phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge I ran into was setting up Visual Studio to show the designer while errors were occuring before development even started.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing Visual Studio and successfully executing my small test program on my Nokia Lumia 920.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IpOverUsbSvc.exe is a rather important service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Where's the Love for Windows Phone?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now that I've learned that developing on Windows Phone is completely possible, continually development upon the Windows Phone will increase my portfolio enough to start going to Android/iOS developers and say "I'm willing to port your application to Windows Phone."
