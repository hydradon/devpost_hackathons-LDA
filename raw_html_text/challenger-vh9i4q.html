                    Nowadays we do not pay much attention to scientific news around us. What is the reason that we do not read articles?
I think because they are not so inviting. I thought that if they would be presented as quiz then more people would be interested in reading articles.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built in summer 2016 when I started learing iOS development. I built it using Swift and XCode. The backend was Parse API.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    The most difficult challenge was to generate 10 questions every day. For this reason there was a need for writer who would create questions for a quiz.
