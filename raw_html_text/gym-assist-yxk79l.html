                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While working out recently in my gym and doing weighted squats I injured myself due to bad posture which I didn't realize. As a result of that, I had to deal with pain and physiotherapy for the next 2 months. I had a physical trainer (which is pretty expensive) who had taught me what to do, but In my day to day practice missed some critical steps and ended up injured. The requirement is continuous monitoring, coaching, and motivation.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using modern deep learning techniques the app is able to interpret the live video stream and locate the position/coordinates of various body parts which is fed into a rules based engine which 
1) Keep count of the exercise being performed
2) Matches the realtime posture with the rules for that particular exercise to check if everything is being done correctly.
