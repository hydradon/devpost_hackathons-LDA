                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It started with a joke. Playing with gadgets. We rented a few gadgets from the hardware library and kind of built a story around it. It snowballed into an idea that is incredibly helpful to certain people and also looks pretty damn cool and futuristic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using hand gestures such as 'wave in' or 'wave out' to choose a user specified option which is thrown into the Yelp Search API to generate a list of results to match the user. The best result is chosen and its phone number is used to text the business and order/reserve food or other products via Twilio's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an Android application using the Android Studio, the Myo SDK, Yelp API, Twilio API, PHP and NGROK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all new to android and it was a shock. We lost a group member after a day. Myo presented it's own fair set of challenges as we had to get used to using it. We had problems with finding an Android phone to test our project on as the Firephone was broken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a fully functional Android app, we hacked Myo. We overcame so many Android errors/exceptions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to build a Android app, we learnt how to use Myo and how to hack Myo. We also learnt how to use APIs better.
                </p>

                    What's next for Hackthingy2
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better algorithm to match the businesses with users. Improved user interface. Better use of the location services.
