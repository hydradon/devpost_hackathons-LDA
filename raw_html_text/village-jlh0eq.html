                    Inspiration:
                </h2>

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Village is a social networking app that allows parents to connect with each other( and roast their kids). its key features are: creating Group chats of parents with kids in the same activity, alerts to free days/nights and suggests ideas to parents to help them relax, e.g. movie night, upcoming festivals, thirdly it also allows parents to create sub profiles for their kids under their main profile; here they can add info about their kids such as age, activities they enjoy, dietary restrictions etc. lastly the map feature would let parents save locations of activities for easy access,

                <p>
                    Time constraint. we couldn't expand on all the ideas we had and since we were first time hackers we couldn't make every feature come to life.
