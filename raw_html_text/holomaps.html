                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build an indoor navigation system that could greatly help companies in warehouse management using Hololens. Millions of dollars are spent in training employees on how to navigate through warehouses and to understand the logistic systems present in those environments. We asked ourselves a very simple question: What if fetching important components and finding parts on warehouses were as easy as completing a quest on a video game?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The plan was to effectively map indoor elements and set up different beacons so that workers could visually localize where different packages were located within warehouse, showing exactly on what shelf a part was. We then planned to couple this localization method with smart scanning methods. The idea was to use the hololens to detect whether a located part was correct, and given this feedback, enable the worker to effectively ship the parts to the right location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Holomaps guides users around an indoor space with waypoints and direction arrows pointing the correct way. It uses the Djikstra shortest path algorithm to compute the most optimal path between the different nodes indoors.

                    That we got to develop for hololens for the first time and that we idealized a concept that potentially could be used to benefit multiple million dollar industries

                <p>
                    A new development environment of Unity + Hololens. We also understood the importance of preparation and experience and preparation when developing a product.
