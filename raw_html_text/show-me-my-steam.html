                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build on the statistics Steam already gives its users by adding more detail to the data available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes a Steam ID and uses the Steam Web API to get the user's data and display unique statistics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A JS file implements the API to access Steam data, which we modify and summarize for the user.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    None of us knew JavaScript.

                <p>
                    1st Hackathon for all of us. Fully functional, but could be prettier.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Implementing API's. JavaScript === bad.
