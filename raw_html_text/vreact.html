                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A common issue in educational institutions is that teachers cannot satisfy the unique needs of student: some students prefer lecture-based teaching while others prefer a hands-on approach.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can look at various 3D models of common molecules and interact with the molecules such that the user can learn more information about the particular molecule, and see example reactions and the products of those reactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity and 3DS Max, we built molecule objects and imported those onto Unity. We used Unity and C# to arrange the molecules in a confined space and show information about molecules once they are selected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most time-consuming processes was connecting the Oculus Rift up to our computers, and one of the other biggest challenges that we faced was having object interactions in Unity through the VR headset.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product is able to work on the Oculus despite this being our first exposure to VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning about C# and understanding how the Oculus works with respect to Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VReact
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to have a larger molecule library, such that the user will be able to call for any molecule. We also would like for the reaction products to be animated, such that the user will be able to see the products become the reactants.
