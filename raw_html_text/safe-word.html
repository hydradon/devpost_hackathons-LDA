                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever walked home, dark, alone, probably late at night and although you know you're fine you kinda wish there was an easy way to make an emergency call (if you ever needed too) without pulling out your phone, dialing the number... Well great, Apple/Android releases that, just press a button 5 time and, oh wait, an obnoxiously loud siren plays. Subtle right?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Safe Word does exactly what you want it to do. It allows you to say something, a safe word, and immediately call 911, a friend, family member, whomever.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Xamarin for the app and Google Cloud Speech Recognition to determine if the safe word was said.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Cloud Speech Recognition, I'd never used something like that before it turned out to be extremely difficult. I eventually got the Rest API working but I had already used 3/4 of my hacking time!
