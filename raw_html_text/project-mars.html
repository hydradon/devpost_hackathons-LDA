                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The theme of "Shape the Future" gave us two sources of inspiration: the future of the world is in the hands of the next generation, and there is great power in shaping the future. The power of the gods in greek and roman mythology, as well as their relationship with their children, inspired us into building an asynchronous cooperative platformer in which one player plays God rescuing their daughter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One player plays as God, uses the Playstation Move controllers to rotate and explore the puzzle cube presented. However, they cannot directly interact with objects within the cube unless they have been touched by the second player. The second player plays as the Gods Daughter, and uses a gamepad to navigate the environment within the cube, highlighting objects to be manipulated bye the God. Gods Daughter will stick to the surfaces of certain edges allowing for movement without worrying about the constantly rotating environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was built from a Unity framework (made by  Carlos Gonz&aacute;lez D&iacute;az) which allowed Unity to work with the PS Move controllers. The controls for the God and Daughter were developed from scratch to try and build an intuitive control scheme to use. The assets and art were built by Shi Zhe Koh, taking inspiration from games such as Rime and Journey. The music and the sound effects were composed by Julian Surma, producing a slow, purposeful pacing as well as contrasting a mystical sound to a futuristic visual aesthetic to build a more intriguing and inviting universe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenges involved building the controllers for both the God and Daughter. The PS Move API that was used could sometimes cause a lot of jittering and desync. The controllers were smoothed as much as possible, but the process of building the smoothing was pretty time consuming. The Daughter controller was particularly difficult since building an intuitive control scheme which restricted players to faces of objects required us to consider many different cases where different control schemes would be more appropriate (i.e. which way does the player go when pushing forward on a flat plane and at a 90 degree angle?).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The control schemes took a lot of time so the fact they work so well is a huge achievement for us. The music, art, and overall aesthetic of the game evolved to something quite different to our original plan but is still something we're very happy with. Also the fact that it was working too was nice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot in our individual roles. We learned about animation, implementing music in Wwise, the physics engine in Unity, motion controls, intuitive understandings in using controllers. It was a huge chance for us to step out of our comfort zone and build something we haven't built before.

                    The work with motion controllers plays directly into Carlos PhD research, and is something he hopes to use or learn from in his future work.
