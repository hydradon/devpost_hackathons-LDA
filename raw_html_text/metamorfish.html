                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project revolves around the amazing things that the Muse headband can do: to read brain waves and facial muscle movements. The idea is largely inspired from the tropical fish school screensaver that was popular 10 years ago, and a famous excerpt Zhuang Zi, an ancient Chinese philosophy text, talking about existence via the metaphors of fish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Put on the Muse headband and you can become fish. Move your head to control fish movement. Blink to let your fish move upward a little bit. Jaw clench to make some bubbles. Eat some food if you are hungry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with trying to catch the signals from Muse headband, while building the fish game by a simple UFO 2D game tutorial. We added more features when we finish simpler ones, including multi-scenes, a fish "bro" that is always following you, and a no-fish, purely meditative scene.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are neither familiar with Unity3D engine nor the Muse API. It took a long time to learn everything almost from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A fully-functional game that looks good and plays smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with a full-fledged commercial game engine and IDE with intensive OO-design. We learned how to study a set of completely unfamiliar hardware and software APIs. Most importantly, we learned how to cooperate better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for metamorFISH
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could add multiplayer (more fish) with more Muse headbands.
