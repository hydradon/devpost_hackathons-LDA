                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We we're inspired to create this project mainly because of the drought. We believe that our project would significantly reduce water waste not just here in the United States, but around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project gathers data on soil moisture, current time, current temperature, current perception, and current weather. We then store this information into a database and use that information on both a web and mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed a controller board with an AVR Atmega 2560 microcontroller and wrote firmware for the controller. The feedback control from a moisture sensor and a finite state machine in software control of drip valve watering system to water when necessary. We also designed a wireless communications protocol to further control the board from a website and mobile app. The website will also aggregate the data into visual graphs for the user to track their usage of the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the hardware side we ran into issues looking through the documentation and figuring out how to implement things.
On the software side we ran into issues with Android Studio and how to use ListView.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of finishing our project on time, and overall working well together as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall we learned that the api for any given interface can be updated often which can potentially lead to having to relearn 
certain concepts. Also, we learned that teamwork is very crucial during a hackathon. Our team specialized in a variety of different fields, which allowed us to be a very powerful team all around.

                <p>
                    In the future we hope to be able to use our idea around the world, specifically for countries who could really benefit from our project.
