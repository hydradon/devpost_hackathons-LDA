                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make an advanced project that applied the knowledge we have gained from cs010.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hangman is just the classic game where one user enters a word, and the other user has to guess it letter by letter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using multiple loops and branches to check statements and update strings
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    changing an underscore to a letter every time that letter is found in the first user input and clearing a terminal
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    successfully programming a game of hangman that accomplishes everything we wanted it to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use different functions and apply them in our main function. Additionally, we learned how much teamwork we need to accomplish our goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hangman
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to be able to draw the man hanging so we can give a visual to the player.
