                </h1>
                <p>
                    So after a failed creation of another project, at 9 I decided to come up with this idea. I was chatting with my friends when I wanted to send certain emojis but I could not find the right one all the time and had to look carefully to small icons. So why not create a bot? Certain feeling I want to share, I message it to bot and it replies me with the emoticon which I can copy,paste and use! Implemented only some usual emoticons used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imp: Copy paste feature does not work for messenger in PC/Laptop and only works in mobile phones.
