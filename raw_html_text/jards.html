                    is _ To Learn something you don't know and make it into a skill you can use at some point of our lives. _ Also the AR was a field none of the members have ever had a chance to play with.(Nintendo Switch was also a good motivation):

                    What it does
The jARds - named after the initials of the team members and AR , was discussed to be a series of simple Platform independent Micro games to introduce the concept of AR. There are two apks developed.

                <p>
                    A AR maze which uses a maze pattern printed on paper and uses that as the Virtual Substrate to play the Maze along with detection of a few more trained substrates. The apk is named as
A more in-depth look into Vuforia resulted in creating a moving object AR with virtual buttons and Video names Zombie Walk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it
The whole project was build from scratch with a lot of input from YouTube Guru's and online posts. The easy to understand documentation of both Unity and Vuforia helped us a lot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unity was chosen as the base environment for designing and developing the AR result. The Vuforia package was activated and its functionality was used to its best. Also Blender was used to create or import certain models and data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into
The first challenge was to identify which domain the team wanted to work on. As per the voting the AR was chosen as none of the members had any idea what it was and allowed us to start at the same starting line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting used to C# with C fundamentals and 3D design was a big challenge. We had issue getting the Target Image to be detected the first day and  was solved only after a lot of discussion and failures. It was also found that the Blender Physics do not import directly to Unity and there is a process to follow (Still clueless). Also certain parameter go missing while importing from blender.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
Firstly, Having gained a proper understanding on the Variation from reality to Augmented Reality to Virtual Reality.
The second major accomplishment is completing the Unity - Vuforia Tutorials without a glitch and developing our first ever Android App.
The third Major accomplishment is using the ideas learnt we were able to create a maze and different overlays into a single app.
The last is to integrate moving 3D objects into the app and develop it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned.
What the world expects from Augmented reality and Front-end UX design fundamentals. Also how difficult designing an animation video is and how long it takes to render even a 10 sec frame.
How to start from scratch away from comfort zone and adapt to suit the needs
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for jARds
The next steps for jARds is to look into a bit of Game Design Technology and see where and how these AR devices can help or improve the general living conditions. Example providing an AR based textbook for children in rural areas where computer are missing but smartphones have emerged. This will allow the world to grow into a smaller community.
