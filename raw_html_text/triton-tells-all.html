                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a mom of a young child, working at a startup full time and going to UCSD to get my MBA time is precious! I would rather have Alexa tell me static content such as when is my next class, when is my term paper due, when is my homework assignment due rather than myself spending time logging into Triton Ed and navigating to the calendar and 10 clicks later figure out what was the deadline. Either its buried in professor's email or its hidden inside a calendar. I need more time in my life less time hunting down deadlines!

                    Making an Alexa skill does not need you to be a software developer, you just need to focus on how can Alexa save you time!

                    <li>
                        Curate the content to be more succinct and to the point, currently its a mere cut-paste of the word document received in an email. So when I create the RSS I should make a digest of important information and provide only the summary so, in less than a minute it delivers the important deadlines instead of the 4 mins currently. The current skill was put together to demonstrate future possibility.
