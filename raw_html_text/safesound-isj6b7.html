                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An influx of horror news stories about kidnappings and disappearances inspired us to create a safety app, for those situations that you never know might happen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Listens for chosen spoken keyword that will send a text message to the specified phone number.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java in Android Studios to build this mobile safety app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a suitable voice recognition that is lightweight and works offline was one of our toughest challenges. We eventually settled on one, but the documentation was lacking so it was difficult to do too with it with our knowledge. Most of our group had limited experience in using Java and mobile development, so learning a new language and new concepts in a very short timeframe was quite the challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us had little to no experience with mobile development, so to be able to create a working mobile app with no previous experience was very rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Java and about Android development.
                </p>
