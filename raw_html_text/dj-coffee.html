                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide restaurants/cafes/hotels automatic play listing that would adapt to the mood and environment of the venue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The business owners are then allowed to focus on whats important about the core of their business.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a automatic DJ, generating playlists taking attributes from many factors in the surrounding environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use the time of day, weather, how many people are in the venue and their moods at the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also use sound levels to turn the volume of the music at the time as well as another factor determining the mood and tempo of the music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also allows the venue with the help of a screen to display local news, events in the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this using Google Vision API, Imagga to detect the number of people in the restaurants the atmosphere and mood to determine the playlists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also use Spotify to generate the playlists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And Songkick to display the events in the area.
                </p>
