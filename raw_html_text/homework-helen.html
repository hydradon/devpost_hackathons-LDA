                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have trouble managing our time so we wanted to build something that would help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the moment it only sets a timer for 10 minutes but once we add in the rest of the code it should ask for the user to put in their homework and then set a schedule for them to finish it, including breaks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Thunkable?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to have the two lists list out each homework activity in order of what they should be doing. We could find the min and max but we couldn't seem to get both lists to show.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent half the day focusing on something completely different and realized that idea wouldn't work so we had to change to this and we actually accomplished a lot for not spending the whole day on this. Also, this is the first hackathon for all of us.
                </p>

                    Teamwork is important
