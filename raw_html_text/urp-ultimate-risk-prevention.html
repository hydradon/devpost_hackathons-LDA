                </h2>
                <p>
                    URP, Ultimate Risk Prevention, is a software that monitorizes health human data using a smartwatch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a Tizen OS app that runs on smartwatches, which tracks data that then gets posted to our backend, built with JavaScript using Node.js and Express, who is responsible to sign and store this information on the Ethereum blockchain.
We built a React web app to showcase all this information using graphs and real-time updates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a couple of challenges. For the smartwatch app, we had to learn and understand the logic behind Tizen, as well as how to access sensor data and use that information accordingly. It was also challenging to connect everything with the backend.
We decided to use Ganache to create a local private Ethereum blockchain to use for the test environment of our project, setting up the transactions to sign them on the server-side and coding the smart contract using Solidity, has been challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The final result is a pretty solid project, using many new technologies we never tried before! Although we faced many issues, we got to solve them all and got it all working in a real environment.
