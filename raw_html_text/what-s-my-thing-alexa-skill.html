                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I struggle hardcore to get things done around the house. I have a todo list but I either forget about it or am just so overwhelmed by everything on it, that I don't know where to start. That paralysis often leads to me not doing anything...and the house stays a mess.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's My Thing taps into the Alexa Todo list that I use every day and tells me the ONE thing I need to do today. Whatever What's My Thing says to do, that's the ONE thing I need to get done today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting that one thing done gives a person a sense of accomplishment and motivation to get more done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goodbye paralysis!
                </p>

                    Oh yeah, you get points and badges for completing tasks. Cause, gamification.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill is built on top of the Alexa Node SDK. Lambda hosts the code, S3 hosts the badge assets, and DynamoDB keeps track of each users track record, badges, and points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges was just coming up with the idea. Once I had the idea, I was able to get going. My experience building my previous skill, Math Adventurer, helped a lot here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Something that I still am learning is how to handle certain logic with certain handlers (and the
                    <code>
                        this
                    </code>
                    event) while keeping things DRY. I don't think I've fully cracked that nut yet, but I feel like I'm getting close
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, this is a skill that I'm already starting to use myself. It's been fun coming up with, designing, and naming the few badges the Skill is releasing with (more to come in future iterations!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to read and delete Alexa todo items. I also challenged myself to write all my code using ES6 as much as possible so learning more of that functionality was fun.
