                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from the important day to day maintenance everyone has to recognize...eating food! Food is a crucial part of the performance of athletes; it was so important that the NCAA offered their Division 1 athletes scholarships and grants to unlimited meal plans. We understand that food plays a big role in many sports especially sports where you may need to maintain, lose, or increase your weight before a competition. As college students, we also understand how traveling on the road can impact your overall nutrition. With athletes attending away games, it can be hard to know what options are healthier and out there. At the same time, not knowing the healthier options can lead you to eat mindlessly. This especially rang true for us on this trip to PickHacks as we ate many, many treats and suffered the consequences throughout the weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The FItFoodFinder is an app for traveling fitness enthusiasts, college athletes, and everyday people who are trying to meet their physical goals. TheFitFoodFinder calculates a user's daily calorie intake with consideration of the user's fitness goals, current activity levels, and the style of training that they do. Users can search by zip code of nearby restaurants. Then, users can select a restaurant and view a list of menu items. The menu items may appear in green or red depending on if it meets a user's macronutrients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Swift, Google Firebase to store user information, the Nutritionix API to get data on nearby restaurant's menu items. To test the Nutritionix API, one of our members used Python. We parsed JSON files from this API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges parsing data. We also had many issues with syntax because there were a few iOS native frameworks that we were unfamiliar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall we are very proud to create this app and for it to be mostly functional. For two of our members, this was our first serious Hackathon. This was the first time we competed as a group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Outlining the structure of the app is very important before going straight to the code. A good design goes a long way and a small mistake can cost many painstaking hours of lost progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FitFoodFinder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next phase of FitFoodFinder includes checking additional ingredients so that we can really hone in on a particular diet a user may have or preferences dietary preferences.
