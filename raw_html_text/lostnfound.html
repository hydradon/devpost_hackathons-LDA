                    create a lost and found web for queens college student
                </p>
                <p>
                    as a  student of queens college, we used to see many people lost or forget their flash drivers or chargers in the college include us! The most tough thing is there is no way to help them to get their items back. especially the data in flash drivers. that is why we as computer science students in queens college, we decide to contribute our knowledge learned from the school to make a lostNfound website to help them to get their items back.
