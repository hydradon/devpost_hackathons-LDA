                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yasmin was inspired by how little a lot of us know about finance and banking, even just as consumers - and as the easiest way to reach people is through humour and/or indignation, outright making fun of our lack of financial literacy seemed like a good way to connect with people and make them consider their own knowledge ... and what knowledge they lack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides "excellent and professional" financial information for the user, but PLOT TWIST! They're actually just amateurish attempts at explaining financial concepts leading the user to contact Scotiabank for actually helpful answers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html to create the content, and an external CSS stylesheet to do the formatting. We also used javascript to generate a new question and answer after every page reload.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a collaborative coding platform.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it done in time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to plan and divide jobs beforehand to be more efficient.

                <p>
                    More questions and answers from not-so-experts. There is potential for this project to be further developed and improved into an advertisement for Scotiabank financial advisements.
