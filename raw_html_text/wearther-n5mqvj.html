                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that the weather in Montreal varies a lot and that it's hard to decide what to wear every morning depending on the weather.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use a weather API to check the current weather at the user's location and we display tasteful UI and also a selection of suggestions of what to wear depending on weather conditions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an html file and simply imported other files including a css file and a javascript file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are completely new to web development so we faced many challenges facing the basics. We initially tried to make it completely in Angular, however, we realized we were more comfortable working straight from html files so we switched.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully creating a website, using an API and creating our own UI are all new accomplishments to us so we are proud of the project overall!
                </p>
