                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a student who has Asperger's Syndrome. As such, I empathize with people who have disabilities. I believe that some people may not have the ability to type 911 very fast, and that without getting caught. Thus, I devised a way to make an app that calls 911 and other emergency numbers for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EmergenAPP has one major 911 emergency button. This button is large, and is made for people who may not have the time to dial 911 quickly. This could be elderly people who are suffering from a heart attack, are stuck in a fire, or dangerous altercations as well. Also, I programmed a way for a user to access his or her contacts
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first time I tried writing the big 911 button, it crashed. I had to ask mentors for input and constantly refine my code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be honest, I never thought I would make an android app. While I have programmed in C, C++, Java, and Python, I HAVE NO FORMAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE ANDROID SDK. To have come so far in one day, is a MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to build an android App, and the painstaking yet rewarding process of planning, coding, testing, debugging, and refining your code. I also had the ability to work with others, which taught me that social skills are VERY important in the Computer Industry.
