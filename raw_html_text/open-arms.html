                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The charity "Enabling the Future" from the USA has already done excellent work in promoting the interests of amputees around the globe, allowing makers to fulfill the basic market need for more affordable low tech prosthetic hands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there is still a gap in the market for highly personalized solutions, a service that connects makers with those in need, but also promotes collaboration between manufacturing professionals and clients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This service offers a geotagging map for the purpose of locating potential supply and demand in the broader community, allowing individuals who can't travel to a major city to have a custom prothesis manufactured in their region.
The php discussion board allows users to share data, photos and other helpful feedback to allow manufacturers to improve their designs. This approach closes the gap in the market and encourages a closer working relationship with clients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The service is driven by the googlemaps API, with the entire front end coded in Javascript. The back-end runs on a combination of php and mySQL, utilizing databases, forms and a discussion board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have not yet run into any challenges, thankfully. :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that this is my first foray into web development, it's not as bad as I used to think.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything in this project has been a learning experience. Google maps API, mySQL and php back-end are just a few highlights.
                </p>
