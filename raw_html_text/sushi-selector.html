                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I work at a sushi restaurant in my free time and wanted to work on my PHP/MySQL skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Handles adding rolls to a database based on their ingredients and searching for those rolls based on their major ingredient. Displays rolls that match search along with their image(s).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built it from scratch on localhost (not deployed yet) using MAMP to serve my MySQL database and Sequel Pro so I could view my database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge I ran into was determining how to link to the photos of the rolls using a variable in the file path.  I ran out of time to figure out how to use radio buttons to enable searching for only gluten free rolls or only cooked rolls.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having done 100% of my project on my own with no team members and using real data for something I might turn into a more professional toy for the restaurant to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about how PHP and HTML and MySQL work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sushi Selector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    working on the search function to make it searchable on other fields than just main fish.  Adding in the gluten free and cooked radio options and being able to search off of that.
