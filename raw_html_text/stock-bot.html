                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa was a really cool piece of technology and we wanted to leverage it's new tech.

                <p>
                    we used python 2.7 and AWS Lambda to host our code. In the python code, we used yahoo API

                <p>
                    We had never used AWS Lambda before or the Alexa skills package. Many of the team members had never used APIs either
