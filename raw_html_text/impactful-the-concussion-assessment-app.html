                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cases of concussions are often not caught.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a simple app that can be used to diagnose concussions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us were completely inexperienced in app design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have made our first app, and it works well too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java is definitely useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ImpactFul - The Concussion Assessment App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to increase diagnosis of concussions and increase safety in all sports.
