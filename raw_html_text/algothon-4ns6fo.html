                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assigns labels to features using tables of stock prices and ITF web news sentiment
                </p>
                <p>
                    Features = combination of sentiment, news buzz, news volume
                </p>
                <p>
                    Label =   1 is current price &gt; last price 
                    = -1 otherwise at that same time
                </p>
                <p>
                    Four training models are run on the sentiment data to predict the label using the data and if three or more agree on the label value,  then we buy/sell that stock depending on the value of label. Otherwise, nothing the signal is to hold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sentiment data extracted from ITF and each row has the previous 30 days worth of sentiment data compressed into a string. The decompression is done by a helper function and the trading strategy is run.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python3, using Keras and Tensorflow. With datasets being pulled from Quandl and then the model tested on Quantopia.
