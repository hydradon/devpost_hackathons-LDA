                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many grandparents are in need of medical assistance or care giving. Since their children are often too busy or live far away, they are not able to care for their parents and are not willing to put their parents in retirement homes. This application could solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application connects care seekers with caregivers within a certain location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift and Xcode to create the front end portion of our application and a user-friendly interface for the elderly and caregivers to use. We connected the front end to the back end, which was created using python and django.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially had a little trouble starting the learning process for Xcode and swift. We also had trouble connecting the front end and back end, but we were able to make it work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our working application that implements location services, permission handling, profiles, user info/databases. We are most proud of the fact that we could help others in need of assistance who may not be up to date on available resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code in swift and app development requires a thorough planning process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for iCare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will integrate more features in the profile section, such as a profile picture. We will add a rating and certification system to make sure caregivers are trustworthy. We will also add a messaging feature for care givers and care seekers to communicate.
