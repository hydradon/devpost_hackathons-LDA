                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Binary number representations can be difficult to understand when starting off.  We wanted to make a device that would help anyone who wanted to learn binary learn it in a more entertaining way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In one mode we convert binary input taken from switches and output the hexadecimal representation on a seven segment LED array.  In the other mode, we challenge the user's knowledge of binary representations, providing a randomly generated number that the user has to match using the switches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented the design in verilog on the Nexys4 FPGA
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We honestly don't know verilog much at all, so everything for this project was a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get a basic version running.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We managed to create a linear feedback shift register in order to create a pseudorandom number generator to allow for new numbers to match in the "Test Your Knowledge Mode."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned verilog!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Learn Binary on FPGA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add the ability to choose to display in either hexadecimal or decimal representation.
We would also like to add the ability to change the input mode, allowing the user to learn not only unsigned binary, but sign-magnitude and two's complement formats as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a third team member who had to leave and wasn't able to join accept the team invite:  Eric Evans
