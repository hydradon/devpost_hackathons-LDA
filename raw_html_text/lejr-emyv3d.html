                    Lejr was inspired by the difficulties college students have when trying to figure out how to split the costs of living together. My roommates and I devised a smart spreadsheet, but it was still tedious manually entering numbers. We decided to create Lejr to help streamline that process. Roommates can create a group, take a picture of their receipts, and everything is automatically balanced. We took a page out of cryptocurrency and decided it was much more efficient to measure everyone's balance as how much each person owed to the group.
