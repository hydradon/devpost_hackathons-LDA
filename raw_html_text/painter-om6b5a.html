                <p>
                    I am an artist and wanted to try something which Alexa can do for me, and thus came the idea in my mind, "Why not take the help of Alexa in

                        mixing colors
                    </strong>

                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now mix colors with the snap of a finger! You can ask the skill to mix two colors or, you can use it to show color. For example, you can say, "
                    <strong>
                        Mix green and gold
                    </strong>
                    ," and it will return you with the name and hex code of the new color formed. Also, you can ask "Show me the color
                    <strong>
                        Alpine Blue
                    </strong>
                    ," and it will return the color in your Alexa companion app. The blending of the colors here is done by calculating the
                    <strong>
                        RMS
                    </strong>
                    value of the
                    <strong>
                        RGB values
                    </strong>
                    . The skill tries to find the name of the new color formed, but if it does not find any, then it will return the name of the color closest to it.

                    How I built it

                    The complete backend was made in Python using the flask-ask module.

                    is a Flask extension that makes building Alexa skills for the Amazon Echo easier and much more fun. The app is hosted on Heroku.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mixing of two colors using their RGB values was a challenge. I didn't know what kind of mixing is required, whether to add, subtract or take a simple average. Finally, I was satisfied with the RMS. Also, finding a name for the color was a headache. I had a small database, thus if I didn't found the actual name for the color then I searched for the closest color to it and returned that instead. Displaying the color to echo Display devices (Show and Spot) was also a challenge with flask-ask, but I could figure it out eventually.
