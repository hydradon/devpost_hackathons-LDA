                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal was to make a simple VR game that could show off the accuracy of the Oculus touch controllers and avoid making a VR game that would make the player sick in any way. So we scrapped any ideas that involved having moving backgrounds or players and went with an internet sensation of 2016, the water bottle flip challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players take turns battling to see who can perfect the water bottle toss and stick the most bottles upright to a table across the room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity Engine 5 to incorporate the touch controllers and the Oculus, and blender for 3d modeling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Touch controllers to properly recognize collisions with the bottles and handling the grabbing of objects and the physics of releasing the bottles. We also had a hard time finding a way to make the game possible. At first, we all thought it was impossible to land even one bottle. But after many tweaks and run-throughs of testing, we found a good balance of difficulty (Our record at the hackathon was 17 bottles landed in one run).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knocked this game out and have the basics idea finished in the first night, despite having multiple issues with coding the bottles to be grabable and getting their accelerations and rotations to match the controllers when released.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to implement the api for the touch controllers into unity, specifically how to grab and throw objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Watter Bottle Flip VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a few killer ideas that we had implemented in the hackathon but turned off for our submission because they just simply were'nt polished enough. I am going to upload the game on GitHub and share a zipped file with the executables so anyone else with a Rift or Vive and the controllers can try it out. Future ideas floating around are many modifier ideas (such as gravity, size, different bottles,etc.), different maps, a score keeper and reset button, and maybe in the far future even online 1v1s.
