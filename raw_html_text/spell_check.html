                    The purpose of this project is to design a spell check that will automatically correct spelling mistakes without you having to go back and fix the mistakes yourself. When the program encounters a misspelled word, it will automatically correct it, based on the knowledge the recurring neural network has acquired. The program is designed using three layers of LSTMN and one layer of dense network, which applies a softmax function. 
Currently, the database only supports 433 of the most frequently misspelled words. We are training the network on a total of 1,200 words, but it is not fully trained on all of these words at the moment.
