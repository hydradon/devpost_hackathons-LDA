                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an application which creates an ecosystem for anyone who cooks to sell their products to anyone who wants to buy within a locality. The food app allows our chefs to donate a portion of their earnings and the customers to donate  small pennies (by rounding off to the $0.50). It is a platform for people to socialize, monetize their hobbies and also donate!.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built using Android Studio 2.1.2 with FireBase as the backend. The data analytics was done using tableau software and D3.js. The app has two major modules eat and cook, we delegated the modules amongst the team members and integrated it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge faced was integrating the Google OAuth API to allow users to automatically sign-in using the Google Account. The next challenge was integrating D3, which does analytics on the GoodEats data. We are still working on it.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely happy that we were able to build a user-friendly and functional app with a slick UI. The design and above mentioned functionalities were developed from scratch within a timeframe of approx. 8 hours.
