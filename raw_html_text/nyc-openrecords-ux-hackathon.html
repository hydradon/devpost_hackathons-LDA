                    , I drafted definitions for two types of user roles (Newbie and Pro), and wrote stories and personas for 4 different users. With the Open Records challenges and these 4 "people" in mind, I envisioned the ideal user flow that would not only
                    <strong>
                        simplify the Make a Request process by allowing the user to learn the necessary background information
                    </strong>
                    , but also
                    <strong>
                        increase the quality of resulting Requests so that both agencies and users could benefit
                    </strong>
                    . I then used these flows as a basis for constructing wireframes for key pages of Open Records.

This time he wants to do it online because "the Internet is faster." He's "not so good at the Internet" so his teenage son is helping him. Together they Googled and came across Open Records.

She might put her son in the nearby Catholic school next year because of her concerns. Because she works full-time, she has to do her online research at night.

                    User Flows:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The proposed user flow is based on the typical structure of a technical or customer support website, prioritizing a Knowledge Base (so users can search and browse pertinent information) and View Requests list (that can easily be filtered, sorted and scanned for information). For Newbie users, by prioritizing, anticipating and answering many of their questions on-site, Open Records can "filter out" users who in fact don't need file a FOIA request and "prime" other users with quality information that will help them write better Requests. Pro users can skip these steps and easily proceed to View Requests or Making a Request. After a Request has been made, a confirmation screen gives feedback to the user that their Request has been sent, and provides a tracking number. Notifications sent by Open Records can be used to alert users who have made Requests when information in the Request has been updated. It is possible to introduce a login/password at this point for users to view more secure information related to their Requests, but this part of the flow has not been mapped for this project.
