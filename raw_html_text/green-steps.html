                <p>
                    Our app does two things. Firstly, it assesses your carbon footprint through a complete questionnaire (questionnaire which is open-source code). We recommend taking this questionnaire weekly or bi-weekly to track your progress. Secondly, it lets you track daily actions that may or may not improve your carbon footprint, this way you can easily and frequently track your evolution. The app also provides many helpful tricks to help you in your journey to carbon footprint reduction.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using the Angular framework
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement a swiping card interface instead of the form to provide a better user experience. Plus, we would work on connecting all the data to dashboard and try building our own carbon footprint calculator.
