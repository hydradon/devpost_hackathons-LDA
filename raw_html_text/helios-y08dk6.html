                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The genesis of Helios stemmed from our own personal struggles in job searching, particularly with respect to the difficulty in finding jobs that were not only relevant but more importantly, attainable given one's skillset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helios functions through cross-referencing keywords from an individual's resume with listed job descriptions. This is accomplished through web scraping major Job listing sites such as Monster and Indeed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website was built primarily using Python, Html, and Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we encountered was finding ways to configure a web scrap for each individual website, because of the difference in the structuring for each one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group was able to implement the vast majority of the components we had initially conceptualized during our planning stage, which is something we were quite pleased with given our lack of experience with project planning, designing, and development in such a short time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest takeaways was the necessity for delegating tasks within a team to cover as much ground as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Helios
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, we hope to continue building on the capabilities of Helios, by further optimizing the algorithms for the keyword process, and assigning respective weights by category.
