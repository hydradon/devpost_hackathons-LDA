                    Our project is all about developing a game project that utilizes procedural generation. The game, eventually, is to become a roguelike at a school setting. Our goal is to create a two-dimensional game with a primary focus on procedural generated game elements. This project will serve as an opportunity for us to learn how to apply our knowledge of software engineering design principles, data structures, and algorithms to make an awesome game concept.

                    As for its status as a Hackathon project, it's certainly nothing special. The game mechanics haven't even been added yet, but it's a huge start in being able to create the tiles necessary to create a random environment to begin with. Please understand. But it's all the rage these days to release your game unfinished and just call it Early Access, right? :)
