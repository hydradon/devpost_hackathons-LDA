                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a voice therapist that gives you advice. I wanted to have the user input custom problems for a real person to write a response that alexa reads- but I ran out of time so this version gives you general advice for now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you little tidbits of advice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the voiceflow platform to organize and design the skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the ISP portion of the skill working was a challenge as the voiceflow platform does not show the full testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the voice skills that I've built from this challenge. Going from no experience with voice apps to building a few unique alexa skills was interesting, challenging, and a lot of fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Natural language processing has come a long way. I think we can definitely build out a more robust therapy option through alexa.
                </p>

                    What's next for Mini Therapist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like for the user to be able to submit custom issues that a real person can reply to.
