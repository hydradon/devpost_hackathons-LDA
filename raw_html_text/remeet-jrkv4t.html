                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend of ours is in the recruiting team and he interviewed more than 9 people at once in a single day. He told us that the video calls were exhausting and he could not remember most of what was said in the meetings. If only those calls were searchable and were saved somewhere, it would have made his life so much easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app transcribes the conversation during the video call and maps the words spoken with timestamps so as to enable us to directly access specific parts of videos by searching for words. 
The AI engine also automatically recognizes "Questions" , "Tasks" and "Statistics" and stores them in a sorted manner for future reference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node.js for the backend. Socket.io was used to create chat channels and we used the webkitspeechRecognition library to convert the speech to text. We tried keeping the UI minimal so as to not distract the user from the purpose of the app. The AI engines looks out for Questions , Stats and ToDo lists. We also used mongodb to store the video calls and the user details.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was really tough to establish real-time video calling on node. A lot of times it worked and a lot of times it didn't.But we were finally able to achieve what we wanted. Also while working with a large tech stack like this, it gets really difficult to debug the code and establish connections between all of them which was yet another challenge that we faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major features include the questions and todo lists that are obtained at end and we really think it is a great feature for an app like this.
We were also able to convert hindi speech to text alongside.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While making this product we learnt how there can be various developments in RTC which can change the whole face of communication. The need of the hour is innovation, not invention. We don't need new technologies, we already have a lot of good tech which we can just improve and innovate upon to achieve greater heights in all aspects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ReMeet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It seems a pretty good startup idea, so we are thinking to work upon this, and launch it as a SAAS service for small to medium enterprises.
