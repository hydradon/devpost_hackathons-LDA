                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a creative idea for a game with three players. We thought that making it around connect four would be achievable.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It accepts the input from the different users based on buttons. It then updates an array that represent the board and does the appropriate math to rotate the gravity and updates the array accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially planned on doing an Android App, so the backend board was built with Java. We decided that doing it in iOS would teach us more, so we switched to that. We had to translate the backend we'd already made to swift and then build the GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using swift, since none of us had experience with it.
Making a GUI from scratch.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rebuilding the backend in swift successfully.
Making a usable GUI.
The algorithm for updating the board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use swift.
A lot about GUIs.

                    What's next for ConnectMore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It needs a lot of polish and a tiny bit of bug fixing. Long term, if we can finish it on iOS, we might port it to Android.
