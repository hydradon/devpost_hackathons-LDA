                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tired of using image recognition APIs to recognize images? Get ready to break out of the mold, with the awkwardly titled Speakifai.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Speakifai uses the Clarifai image recognition API to recognize voices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a database of audio recordings of myself, converted them to spectrographs, normalized them, and trained Clarifai to associate them with words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jumped around between several python UI toolkits before finally settling on a web-based approach. Data normalization was difficult. Had trouble with the fitting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It performs admirably on some of my trials, correctly identifying speech under varying conditions with a reasonable accuracy rate. With some work, it could be greatly improved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More data would have been very helpful. I would have loved to have had a more graphical presentation.
                </p>

                    What's next for Speakifai

                <p>
                    More data and a better UI.
