                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few weeks ago, the two of us were visiting a friend in New York City. Now being computer science nerds, we're always on the look out for a good idea. Our friend was an avid tennis player, and she complained about the lack of practice she was getting! Furthermore, the courts were always full. We realized the potential for a crowd-sourced tennis match making app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MatchMaker pairs you up with other tennis players located near you and around a similar skill level. The app gives you a selection of players to choose from, and if you would like to challenge them to a match, simply click on their icon, view their statistics, and begin chatting with them to schedule a match.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end of the app in Android Studio, using java and XML. We stored the players and their respective attributes in a MySQL database, which is hosted by a node.js server. The Android App makes HTTP requests to the node.js server to get and post data from and to the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because this was the first time either of us have really done Android programming, we were in unfamiliar territory from the beginning. It was challenging to create the android front end as well as the node.js and mySQL back end while learning it at the same time. We also ran into challenges trying to communicate between the front and back end via the HTTP requests and using Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of the product we've created because it is the first fleshed out product either of us have created. It is the first time we designed an Android app, the first time we created a working backend, and the first time we experimented with newer technologies like Google API and Amazon Web Services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that working hard is truly a really rewarding experience and that we should do more of these.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MatchMaker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the near future, we hope to expand functionality of MatchMaker by first hosting the node.js server and database on Amazon Web Services. We also want to create an elo system to match players more appropriately, and be able to find courts closer to both players.
