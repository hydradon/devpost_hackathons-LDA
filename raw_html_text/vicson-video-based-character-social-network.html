                        In schools, this system can be used over CCTV footages to identify cases of bullying, alienation and ragging among students.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In offices/factories/warehouses, a similar analysis on the CCTV videos can help gauge who can be potential collaborators/teams based on their positive emotional chemistry.

                <p>
                    Given a video from the TV series F.R.I.E.N.D.S, the system caters to queries like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Which all characters are present in each video frame?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What is the emotional profile of each character when they are interacting with each other?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How does a user&rsquo;s emotional profile impact the relationship among the characters?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What is the flow of sentiment across the timeline?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Using Azure&rsquo;s Custom Vision service, we trained a classifier to identify the lead characters of the T.V. series.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using OpenCV, extracted each frame of the video.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using Azure&rsquo;s Face Api, detected faces in each frame. The service returns the coordinates of each face and its respective expression.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next, we feed the detected faces into our Custom Vision classifier to map each face to one of the characters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In parallel, we extracted audio from video using ffmeg (Python). The audio file is further fragmented using the heuristic that an average human speaks an English sentence in approximately 5 secs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using Azure&rsquo;s Speech api, generated transcript for each audio file.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using Azure&rsquo;s Sentiment service, extracted the sentiments associated with each dialogue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aggregated the information to answer desired queries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed a Javascript based front-end to visualise the results.

                    Challenges we ran into

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        The T.V. series F.R.I.E.N.D.S lasted for 10 years. The characters underwent significant physical changes leading to a more complex model. Solution: active learning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Custom Vision api doesn&rsquo;t take any input from the user that which region maps to what tag. Hence, in the case of character identification, the model was using non-facial features like body structure etc.
                    </li>
