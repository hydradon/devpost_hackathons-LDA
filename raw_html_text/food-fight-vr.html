                <p>
                    Mushrooms mutate and come alive in a grocery store, and they&rsquo;re not happy to see that their ancestors have been subjected as mere produce for humans. As revenge, they're poisoning your customers on contact and tearing up the place!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The onus is on you, the grocery store employee, to defeat all the mushrooms that come your way with the food you've got in the bakery!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Battle with a baguette or squirt bottles of ketchup. However, your items are limited so you need to be resourceful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FOOD FIGHT VR is a whimsical non-violent FPS game that is fun and appropriate for all!

                    ==============================
                </p>
                <p>
                    I dedicate this to my eight year old brother who loves videogames. With a growing concern of the influence of violence in first-person shooters, I wanted to created something that was still fun (the FPS mechanic), but a little more appropriate for all audiences. I liked the idea of a traditional food fight and wanted to build something that allowed the player to feel a bit frenzied. So, instead of guns, I opted for bottles of ketchup and a spray bottle.

                    Becoming a VR developer has been a dream of mine since I got exposed to it, and I am thankful to have been a part of the Make School academy. My confidence as a programmer has skyrocketed and I've come to love game programming and the challenges that come with it. Building my own miniature world, no matter how strange it is, and letting others experience something fun temporarily outside of reality, has been a rush. Judging from how others reacted to the game during demo day, I can see that there is a demand for cute, colorful, kid-friendly VR games, and I hope to continue adding more features to the game and release it on Steam.
