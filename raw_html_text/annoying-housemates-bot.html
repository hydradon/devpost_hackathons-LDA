                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was build entirely on Python. We also utilize the
                    <a href="https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot" rel="nofollow">
                        python-telegram-bot
                    </a>

                        Telegram Bot API
                    </a>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Telegram API was not clearly documented, so we spent a huge chunk of time trying to understand how to use the API. In addition, there were also features that we did plan, and bugs we intend to fix, but did not have enough time to finish. We also couldn't figure out how to deploy it to Gcloud
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned a lot about Python and using APIs as this was our first time using Python, also first time messing around with APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of now, the app only runs locally, so a good start would be to deploy it to a server. The app is still buggy, so we'll definitely have to fix that. We would also implement a really cool feature that we did not have enough time for.
