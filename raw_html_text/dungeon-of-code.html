                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As kids, we were all interested in coding, but it was hard to find resources for beginners to learn. When we saw the JP Morgan Chase challenge at the DemonHacks hackathon, we all individually decided to work on this project together even though we did not know each other prior.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dungeon of Codes is a web-based game that is simple and easy to use. It guides the player through four levels, and allows you to play against your friends. As you progress through the levels, you learn more about computer science topics while also solving fun puzzles related to dungeons and castles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first created the website using an HTML/CSS and Bootstrap template. Then, we embedded a Trinket frame into each of our levels so that the players could interact with a shell like interface. The Trinket frame is powered by Java code that handles the game logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had much frontend development experience, so we really had to research different tools to use for our project. We also wanted to use a shell like interface in the website since many programmers interact with their code on a shell, but we were not sure how to embed the shell onto the website. After much research, we were able to overcome these challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we built a functional website since none of us had much experience in that field. It was also really exciting when we figured out how to embed the shell into the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about HTML/CSS, Javascript, and increased our knowledge of Object Oriented Programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dungeon of Code
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like improve the frontend design maybe using React.js. Also it would be great to expand the scale of the game and include visuals with the game.
