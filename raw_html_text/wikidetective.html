                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creepy Wikipedia articles featured on sites such as Youtube and BuzzFeed.

                <p>
                    Wikidetective is a noir murder-mystery game which allows the player to utilize Wikipedia articles to solve a detailed murder case.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask (a Python microframework) and JavaScript to create an animated, immersive text-based experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a few challenges getting the animated typewriter style text display working.  We ended up switching building tools multiples times in order to find the right utilities.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the game into a working state that allows the player to actually experience the entire storyline and really get into the plot of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that in the future we should come in with an idea as it used a lot our time to decide on a good idea for a project.  We also learned that we should have some sort of plan on how we are going to accomplish a task before the hackathon actually starts as we ran into a lot of issues switching from tool to tool.
