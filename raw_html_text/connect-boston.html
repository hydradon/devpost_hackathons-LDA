                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are poor college students who don't have cars, but need to get to class, and need to live in Boston at an affordable price. We know it doesn't only affect us, and that this kind of information should be visualized for all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maps MBTA stops and the prices of apartments nearby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Javascript and React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Steep learning curves with trying out new technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It runs, just fast enough to catch the bus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the power of friendship (and JAVASCRIPT), anything is tolerable to an extent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Connect Boston
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything we thought we would implement but didn't get around to. And a chatbot that tells you where to live.
