                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine a classroom of college students. Typically, they want to learn the course material comprehensively and in depth. However, they will sometimes miss a concept. Moreover, the busier students might have to miss a class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if there was a way to easily fill any holes in understanding?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web-based social media service allows students to learn as a class, generating from student-sourced notes a map of the lesson's concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a real-time database (FIrebase) to capture each student's notes for a class. We then found the important keywords within those notes using IBM's Alchemy API and displayed them to the user via a clean-built website and a hacky algo output screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we disagreed strongly about what CSS frameworks and content delivery systems to use, which prolonged our development time. But, we discovered bulma.io and a node.js server wizard and that brought our team together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the clean webpage solution that we discovered with bulma.io and the powerful keyword analysis we accomplished with IBM's Alchemy API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about clean CSS formatting with bulma.io and about the powerful capabilities of GIMP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CUNYSlackers (CUNY Discourse)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to bring this application around to crowd-sourced data testing, with which we will hone our concept-finding algorithms.
