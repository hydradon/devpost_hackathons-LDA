                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make the task of viewing a person's GitHub and the breakdown of language experience into a palatable, easy to read form.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzes recent commits to a repository and visualizes the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a backend database that uses a person's GitHub username to build a visualization of recent commits and coding experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into an issue with the database setup and the communication between the backend database and external functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to incorporate machine learning into our project, the ML identifies which "category" a programmer is most likely to fall under, given language use and personal choice. It then aggregates data from the database to compare with the user's own data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about different solutions to accessing and utilizing APIs and building a program's framework more efficiently.
                </p>

                    What's next for Git analyzer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A more in depth look into a user's Git Repository with many more visualizations and graphics.
