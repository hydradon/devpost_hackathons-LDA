                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by retro and web games to create an interactive application to engage users in managing money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, you play a game in which wads of cash fall from the sky. You catch them in a basket, and in the end you have a total yearly income. On the following page you distribute that income to various accounts (mortgage fee, savings, etc.) in appropriate increments, and we'll tell you if the money distribution is appropriate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server is built to run on Node.js. The 2D game is built with Unity using C#, and is embedded in the web page through WebGL. JavaScript and jQuery are used to update page elements and allow the user to interact with the money distribution page. The pages were created with HTML5 and styled with CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took us a long time to pass a variable from Unity to JavaScript on the receiving end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating assets for a 2D Unity game, implementing them in a fun and efficient way, and creating something educational and interactive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of our team members learned new aspects of JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. We learned to work as a team and delegate parts of the project while keeping the code cohesive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Money Catcher
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More in-game UI features and sound, a functioning savings calculator/graph for the savings slider on our web page.
