                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are exploiting the fact that the human hearing range does not go beyond 20,000 hz. Phone microphones and other microphones can go a little further, which means that sending data through sound is possible without it being audible. This has implications in marketing, where a user in a specific location could be learning more about a product by receiving links about it. Similar to a QR code, it can be used as a way of easily sending links to nearby devices, without the need to connect to WiFi or Bluetooth.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it using Java to start with, with plans to take it to an android app. We also plan to create a speaker set up using an Arduino, which will act as the transmitter.
