                    emerged from the collision of established fine art institutions and cryptographic digital ownership. We were inspired but underwhelmed by prior art such as
                    <a href="https://left.gallery/" rel="nofollow">
                        left.gallery

                    </a>
                    . Instead, we focused on non-skeumorphicly translating the experience of a traditional art gallery into digital space: set exhibition dates, limited distractions, neutral environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        dot.gallery
                    </em>
                    hosts curated, time-bound exhibits of digital works of all kinds, crypto or otherwise. Admission is limited and priced progressively (on a bounding curve). Attendees move through a sequence into the magic space of the exhibition, and the exhibition can only be viewed when the gallery is in full-screen in order to take up the entire frame of reference. The works demand the attendees' presence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once in the gallery, attendees can browse works and their narratives. Each movement from one work to another etches a line into a token that is presented upon exit. While viewing NFTs, attendees create an NFT. Moreover, attendees are given 3 tokens to place on works and trade for one of the work's tokens. In this way, we hope to generate art as artefacts of the exhibition experience that can be freely traded in the open market. We hope and expect

                        dot.gallery
                    </em>
                    will be the first introduction to digital ownership for large demographics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, when attendees exit the gallery, they can optionally "exit through the gift shop" and enter an artist's backroom to buy goods or negotiate the sale of an art piece.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend is a React Typescript project utilizing a Prisma and SKALE backend. For subtle animations, we rely heavily on react-spring. The SKALE Ethereum-compatible chain posts the NFTs that undergird the memorabilia layer of the gallery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Defeating entropy and bravely facing the forward march of time. Also, the walk path memorabilia is dope.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ruthlessly simplify the experience and focus on the pixels that matter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for dot.gallery?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initiated discussions with curators and galleries, including Haus der Kulturen der Welt (HKW) and the KW Institute for Contemporary Art here in Berlin, to partner on future exhibitions. We plan to turn
                    <em>
                        dot.gallery
                    </em>
                    into a DAO that distributes attendance fees between the artists, collectors, and curators that coalesce to put on each exhibition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One feature we trimmed off with some regret was real-time chat for each work to provide a space for attendees to connect with one another during the synchronous exhibition. This presence feature would also include the ability to trade memorabilia with other attendees.
