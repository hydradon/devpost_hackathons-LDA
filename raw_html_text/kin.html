                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is students at our school not completing their homework. And we believe its because parents don't check-in on them. So we want to solve this problem by making this app/website for parents to be able to check-in on their children whether they are at home or at work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teacher will submit the homework he or she assigned in class each day. Then the parents will get a notification showing that they child have homework. Then they can remind their child to do their homework and keep track if the he or she is doing the homework.
