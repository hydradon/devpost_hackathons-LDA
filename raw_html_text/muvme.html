                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this product was motivating kids to practice their homework.  When kids practice homework, they tend to go off task and navigate to other websites to play games or engage on social media sites.  Perhaps they go off task because they need inspiration to practice.  This app will motivate kids to stay on task.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The client enters inspirational phrases in 3 categories, namely, 3 inspirational phrases from their favorite books, songs, and movies.  In addition, they enter two additional pieces of information, 1) how often they would like the inspirational phrase to notify them on their mobile device, either hourly or once per day and 2) if they would like to receive a chime, device vibration, or no indicator.
