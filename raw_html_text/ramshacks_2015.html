                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought using credit card information, combining it with EEG input, and using other healthcare information would provide a really cool app experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app uses Heartrate monitors and an EEG headband to show data output. Additionally, we implemented an age/stress feature that is based on credit card purchases and account information. This includes looking for purchases like "ABC store" to weigh the probability of being 21 or over. Additionally, it uses information about the number of credit cards and overall wealth to determine an overall profile of the person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this program with Android Studio and attempted to include Jenkins, including setting up the server. We had occasional git issues and did not fully implement Jenkins, in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a major android compile error that resulted in roughly 20 man hours being wasted. We finally solved it by copying our entire project into a new project manually, which finally solved the issue. The original cause of it is still unknown.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works. We had a lot of hardware to work with and git was not being patient with us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Be very careful about the different Android builds on people`s systems.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further implementation of a lie detection feature would be useful. It currently is rudimentary and shows many false negatives.
