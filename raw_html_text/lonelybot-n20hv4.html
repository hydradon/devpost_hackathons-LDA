                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Telegram has been increasingly popular among students and we felt that it was a interesting platform that we could utilize to reach out to other users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bot can provide answers to questions that you ask it regarding many common topics and even simple calculation.
The bot also has a convenient checklist that can help with task management such as to-do lists and other tasks or notes.
The bot also has a expenditure ledger that helps you keep tabs on your incurred costs and keep an eye on your own personal budgets or quotas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Telegram bot API in node.js and also imported other API such as WolframAlpha to help us in our automated tasks and services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Certain parts of the API were rather difficult to understand in the short time frame of the Hackathon, especially since we are relatively new to programming and with independent projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are quite satisfied that the bot functions well and achieves the goals we initially hoped it would achieve, however, the capabilities of the bot is still far from optimal and can be strengthened further.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt that it is rather tiring to rush out a project in 24 hours, and that API libraries and abstractions can be very powerful in streamlining tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LonelyBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can roll out more useful functionalities in other popular aspects of people's lives
