                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by another funny quiz game called 'The Impossible Quiz'.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program makes a quiz with four(or sometimes more) answers for each question.  However, only one answer is correct and getting one wrong will make you restart from the beginning.  We also added some secret buttons and answers so be sure to look out for those!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this code using html and css on repl.it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very indecisive as to what our project would be at the beginning of the hackathon.  This is everyone in our groups first hackathon and we have very little to no experience in coding.  We eventually decided to make a website with html and css, and after many hours and lots of googling/some mentors helping us, we finally completed our goal.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of the style of the site and secret buttons we created.  It is very inspiring to have learned the essentials of html and css and be able to implement it into a project within a day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of html and css; headers, links, pages, buttons, hovering, animations, shadows, etc...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Oof Quiz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We might expand this in the future into a cleaner-looking full website and expand all the paths possible.
                </p>

                    P.S

                <p>
                    The links below are different.  The top one leads to the quiz and the bottom one leads to the quiz's answer key.
