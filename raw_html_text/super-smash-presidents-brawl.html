                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This year's presidential race is bringing more and more attention to the political process. Between the provoking antics of Donald Trump, the political revolution sparked by Senator Sanders, the scandals of Secretary Clinton, and the hilarious statements provided by the other GOP candidates, there is clearly something unique about this year's race. Why not make an action fighting game for this memorable presidential election?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is a three-player brawler. Each character (Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump) has basic attacks, movement, and a jump. However, each character also has special attacks based on pop culture affiliations (Hillary Clinton can trap her opponents in a "classified email").
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We downloaded 8-bit sprite templates from online, and then changed them using computer image editing software. Using the new images, we were able to create animations for the moves. Then, we used Unity to make a two dimensional game using keyboard controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Significant challenges included connecting the sprite animations with the code in Unity/C#. Due to recent Unity updates, there was a shortage of tutorials on certain animation functions. We also faced hard challenges on adding GUI elements to appear in the game. Syncing the specific animations became a troubling issue, which we solved through reading through the Unity documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first Unity game any of us have created. This is also the first hackathon for all of us. We are also proud of the modifications we made in pixel art. We also learned to work as a team, dividing tasks between the members in a fair fashion. We learned how to code in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the most important thing in a hackathon is teamwork. Every person on the team was essential to the final product, and although we had our differences, resolving them is what put us forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Super Smash Presidents Brawl
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd love to finish the abilities for each character, add new maps, and add GUI elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Usefulness
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You might ask "How could this project be useful?". In our team's opinion, something doesn't need to allow you to do more work in a shorter time or socialize more to be useful. To be useful, something just needs to make you happy. This project made our team very happy, and we hope it does the same for you.
