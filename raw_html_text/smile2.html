                    Smile!
                </h1>
                <p>
                    You're on camera! Everyone could always smile a little more. 
This Chrome extension reminds you to smile before browsing social media. ML makes sure you won't get through unless you flash a genuine smile... :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that by reminding people to smile before logging on to social media, everyone can become happier over time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the machine learning portion of the hack on python using sklearn's Olivetti faces dataset to determine whether or not a person was smiling. The front end is a Javascript application written using the Chrome extension platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it was many of our first times at a Hackathon, beginning the process was daunting. The inexperience added to the complexity of making different platforms interact with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Training a machine learning model was incredibly rewarding. Above all, we were proud of the fact that we were able to create a product from an interesting idea despite lacking a lot of technical experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with APIs is a painfully dull and mind-numbing process if they are not well-documented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smile!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the ML model better into the chrome extension would make the application more accurate and more effective for people who need the reminders.
