                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from trying to help people overcome obesity. Over 17% of children and teens in America struggle with this health problem. If we can help these teens out in the earlier stages we can eventually lower the percentage of people who have obesity in America. If a teenager is obese in his adolescent years they are prone to be obese in their adult years. This helps to explain why over 35% of adults in America suffer from obesity. Our mission is to help out these people by educating and tracking the health of these teens.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we ran into was thinking about the sensitivity of the apps features. Sometimes asking for too much information could make people feel more uncomfortable.
