                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most people are somewhat aware of major armed confrontations that occur, but often do not know where they occur. I built this applications to hopefully alleviate this issue.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a map mashup of any type of armed confrontations. This means that any one can submit an entry to the map! The advantage of this is that it provides a better outlook of news, as people living  in different areas have different perspectives on global armed confrontations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an android application built using the ESRI ArcGIS SDK, as well as a NodeJS backend + database solution. Initially an Arc solution was attempted, but did not work out so well for the data in this application.
