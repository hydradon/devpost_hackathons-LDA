                        ## Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    The first two hackathon we participated, was amazing experience. But, that did not stop us there. We got more hungry. We wanted to learn more. We wanted something more challenging. We wanted to build something. We wanted to show something. That's why we are here at HackTX 2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        ## What is SwapIt?
                    </strong>
                    SwapIt is a simple web app with clean UI. We wanted to give more power to customers. Our web app allows airlines passengers to change switch their seats before flight easily with one another. They can pick their seat based on availability and the person seating around them. It also gives people little incentive for letting other people on their seat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        ## How we built it?
                    </strong>
                    We applied the Software Development Life Cycle. We gave ample amount of time on creative ideas and then even more time on creating requirements and database designs. We divided the work on the basis of our skills of expertise. We used Vue.js for front end and Mongo DB Stitch for backend service. It took us 23 hours, 15 minutes and 24 seconds to build the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        ## Challenges we ran into
                    </strong>
                    One of my team mates slept 5 hours, another one 3 hours. Me myself, I slept 1 hour. So, working under extreme stress was our first challenge. As, it was our first experience with Mongo DB Stitch, it took us 15 hours to fix those nasty bugs and issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        ## Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </strong>
                    We are proud to submit another working app to devpost. We are proud of our potential to convert ideas into reality in less than 24 hours. Most of all, we get to talk to many interesting people, the recruiters and also the real world programmers. We count the company swag we received, as our limited edition achievement. We are happy that one more line is going to be filled up in our resume.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        ## What we learned
                    </strong>
                    We faced numerous bugs which we are going to face less in future. We had a good experience on working with Mongo DB Stitch. We learnt about HackTX and the UT Austin community. We had a chance to know about different companies ideas and their involvement in college. Lastly, we learnt about more about team work and trust in us.

                    <strong>
                        ## Future of SwapIt
                    </strong>
                    Let the Airlines Company Decide it. We just want our ideas to be heard and critiqued.
