                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever got to the night before a final and didn't have time to go on Moodle and download every single file for the course? We have the solution for you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MoodleHub checks all your enrolled courses, and when run, syncs all the files related to the course. Everything is organized by user, course, week.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it

                    With love.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a great mind said once: "We don't run into challenges, challenges run into us...."

                    I was once able to touch my knee with my forehead.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Sleeping is good at a Hackathon.

                    What's next for MoodleHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polish it as much as possible and make it available for everyone at EPFL. The code is public so other schools can do the same.
