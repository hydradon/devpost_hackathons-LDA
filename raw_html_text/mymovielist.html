                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each one of us in the team has always wanted a simple and easy way to track the movies/TV Shows that we've watched and get the information from a reliable database like iMDB. That is exactly what led to the creation of MyMovieList!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user inputs a search and then the website searches the iMDB database for potential results and displays them. Then, the user has the option to add a movie out of the results into the table down below. It even links to the original iMDB page. It's as simple as that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript and jQuery to do most of the coding while using HTML and CSS to make the webiste look pretty. We used an iMDB API to request infromation from the iMDB database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all relatively new to Javascript and jQuery so learning the basics of the language took up quite a lot of time. We also wanted to implement a backend with Java but we cancelled that idea because of the complexity of linking Java and HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we made a website that gets data from iMDB, arguably the world's best database for movies and TV Shows. This is very useful in daily life and is super convenient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about team work and obviously learnt new languages which will definitely be helpful in our future!
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Set up a server with a backend so that lists can be saved on it.
