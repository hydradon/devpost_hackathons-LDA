                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People break promises, and a result, hurt others. They lose their credibility and damage their communities. We wanted to inspire positive change by helping people stay accountable to their promises, while also providing an opportunity to give to other communities in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pinky motivates people to keep their promises by allowing them to make contracts with others. If broken, they agree to donate a set amount to a charitable organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, Jenna wants to promise Jane that she will meet her for breakfast on Wednesday.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        She inputs the promise details, agrees on a donation if the promise is broken, and sends Jane a request.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Jane accepts the request.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        On Wednesday, Jane arrives 5 minutes early and opens Pinky to access the unique QR code that Jenna will scan on her phone to keep the promise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But, Jenna sleeps in and leaves Jane waiting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pinky detects that Jenna broke her promise due to its location and time features.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pinky sends Jenna a notification about her promise agreement, and she donates to Coronavirus.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Jenna's credibility rating (% of promises kept) decreases on her profile.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a collaborative process. We sketched the flow of the app on paper together. It was wire-framed and prototyped on Figma, and implemented on Android Studio based on the prototypes. We talked to each other and Googled a lot of our questions along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was that it was two of our developers' first time working on mobile apps, but we overcame it with the help of one of our teammates and Google.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pinky
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Currently, there is 1 type of promise available, which is the promise to meet up with another user. We would like to add functionalities that allow users to make other types of promises - exchange of items, and self goals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Right now, Pinky only supports promises between 2 parties. We want to add support for promises made with groups of people.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Donations are going towards Coronavirus. In the future we would like to add a feature that provides a wider selection of organizations, and give users the option to choose an organization for the other user they are entering into a promise with.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We would like to add secure payment integration for in-app donations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pinky is for Android; next we will design for iOS.
