                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for building this application was the millions of people around the world who don't know how to cook and thus resort to junk food. Canned and junk food is often the easiest and quickest way to make food, but also leads to obesity and cancer. We sought to create a platform that better reaches people and allows them to cook their own healthy meals. In addition, people in third world countries often do not have access to whole meals, thus this app is perfect for them as they can put the ingredients they do have and make a healthy meal for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app takes a list of ingredients and produces a list of meals using those specific ingredients. Also, there is a feature to add a food giving service where people can come and pick up food. Users can also create their own account to save their searches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We used Firebase to host our site and also store our accounts. We used MongoDB and elasticsearch for our search feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of problems. The most  challenging was getting the search algorithm to work properly and find a list of meals given a set of ingredients. We also ran into problems with Firebase, and had to try different ways to store all our data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we can make accounts and store everything on Firebase. We are also proud that our search algorithm works and produces a good list of meals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about programming and using different APIs to help us with our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MealMate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue working with this project and add new features to it. One of the feature we are looking to add is that users just have to take a picture of their ingredients and we implement a Machine Learning algorithm that takes in all the ingredients a user has based on the picture.
