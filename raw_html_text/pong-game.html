                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses a mouse to flick a ball or directional keypad for easier gameplay towards a pyramid of cups. After each throw, the game switches sides so that the other player may throw. If a player hits the top of the cup with a ball, the cup is removed. The game ends once every cup on a particular side is removed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Unity using a few scripts in C#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Switching cameras and adding sound effects was difficult. We also attempted to make the cups hollow cylinders using Blender but we could not get it to work so we resorted to making the cups full cylinders and the the ball just detects hitting the top of the them.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about Unity and how to use C#
                </p>

                    What's next for Pong Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding various special effects including the ability to change the position of the cups as well as an endgame sequence. More sound effects could be added. Stage hazards may appear as the game progresses and the game might become distorted to simulate a "drunkness" factor.
