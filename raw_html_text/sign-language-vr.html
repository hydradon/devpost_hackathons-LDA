                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were programming with VR for the second time, and we wanted to make something that could test our limits in what we know with Unity, the Oculus, and Leap Motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our "game" teaches you the basics of sign language and offers two modes of game play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We haven't worked with Unity much before, and the implementation of both the Oculus and Leap Motion gave us troubles at times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is functional (mostly)!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides the experience from just working on the project, we all learned that the collaboration function on Unity sometimes messes up the cloud saves (so we have to rebuild some stuff).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sign Language VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue working on this project to make it fully fleshed out and look even better.
                </p>
