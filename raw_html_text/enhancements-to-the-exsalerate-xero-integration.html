                    What it does
                </h5>
                <p>
                    We were always getting asked by our customers for a better way to see how well they were looking after their existing customers.  So we designed the Account Management Dashboard where we focus on putting the &ldquo;Client Relationship&rdquo; at the heart of our CRM.  This is the critical piece missing in most CRMs, a tool that provides account managers (AM) with a snap shot of all customers in their portfolios. We import the sales data 2 x daily from Xero so the the AM can see all of the financial information about a client in an easily digestible bite sized tile. We display comparative sales data for Month to Date, Year to Date a rolling 12 months and Lifetime Value.  We also show if the client has any overdue invoices just in case they need some tough love from the Account Manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We group the clients into 4 columns based on how long it&rsquo;s been since the AM (or your company) was last in touch, 3 Months +, 2-3 Months, Last Month and This Month. We show how many days since the last communication and provide a link to the last activity, there&rsquo;s an icon that links to the next planned activity and if there&rsquo;s nothing planned we display a caution sign. Users can segment the AMD by a wide range of criteria so they can quickly refer to a specific client segment such as client rank and or region. The net effect for AMs is they can easily see who needs to be contacted to improve client loyalty and reduce churn.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We had to distill the raw sales data down to meaningful bite sized chunks that would provide a great snapshot for the account manager to be able to notice at a glance any issues with a client.

                <p>
                    We are really stoked to be able to combine sales information with live communications to clients, teasing out which clients need more love.  Displaying the client tiles in time period columns provides a unique view of which client need your attention.

                <p>
                    As usual one size doesn&rsquo;t fit all and some of our customers would like to control the time parameters on the columns.

                    What's next for Enhancements to the Exsalerate Xero integration
                </h5>
                <p>
                    We will add a filter that will display clients that have potentially stopped spending and also give the user to the option to have a follow up task automatically assigned to them if a client hasn&rsquo;t spent when they were expected to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Likewise we are going to add to our rank table so that the client will be able to define the max time period between comms for each rank. When this time period is reached a task will be inserted into the user&rsquo;s ToDo list for to remind them to schedule a catch up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add another column of 6 months+ and change 3 months + to 3-6 months, as feedback from our users is that really small clients may not need any communication every 3 months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Automated rank update based on spend parameters that can be setup in the rank table, this means that as small clients grow they automatically get more love from their AM. In the converse we don&rsquo;t propose to drop the client rank down if the spend drops, rather, as above, prompt the account manager to follow up and see what has happened.

                    What it does
                </h5>
                <p>
                    To achieve the segmentation necessary for the AMD to function we need to enrich the Xero data file. Once you&rsquo;ve imported the contacts, sales codes and sales data from Xero, we've built a download tool to suck all of the data out of Exsalerate so you can bulk update fields that are not available in Xero such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Account Manager
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sales Rep
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rank
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Branch
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Region
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Referral Source
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We also download the sales data into MTD, YTD and rolling 12 months so our users can sort by spend to easily apply ranks to their clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you&rsquo;ve updated all of the fields that they need to to enrich their data they simply drag the sheet back into Exsalerate.  With the updated data we can then provide smart segmentation and sorting of the Account Management Dashboard

                <p>
                    We added the ability to create a draft invoice inside of Exsalerate.  A rep in the field can now easily create an invoice accessing the Xero inventory items and adding a discount if necessary.  When you set up invoicing in Exsalerate you can nominate which of your team needs to be notified when a draft invoice is created in Xero.  Whenever an invoice  is created in Exsalerate and sent to Xero the nominated team members will receive an email saying: &ldquo;Hi Jim, Steve Bonnici has created an invoice for you to approve in Xero.&rdquo; The email also has link directly to the invoice inside of Xero making it super easy for the Accounts person to find and approve the draft invoice.

                    We recognised that we needed to inform the appropriate personnel when a draft Xero invoice was created. So we added a section to our Xero integration page so you can nominate who needs an email about a draft invoice.

                    What it does
                </h5>
                <p>
                    After continued requests from our users to see their Xero quotes in Exsalerate we decided to hack the existing process to import quotes to their pipeline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a customer creates a quote in Xero they just add their personalized @exsalerate.com email as a recipient when sending the quote. We recognise the incoming email as a quote and add the quote to the appropriate customer at the correct stage in the sales process, and assign a task to the account manager to follow-up. The PDF of the quote is visible to all team members in Exsalerate and the quote becomes part of the sales pipeline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means our users can see all of their follow up activity in their Exsalerate ToDo list whether it is new business or following up a quote for an existing customer, ultimately leading to more closed deals.
