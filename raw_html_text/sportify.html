                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In your first gym lesson you have a trainer who tells you when you are to fast or to slow in your movements during the excercise.
At the next sessions you plug in your earphones and do your work out to your favorite music list, but no one helps you with the corect timing in your excecises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sportify solves this problem! It uses your own playlist and turns your music in your personal coach!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connect to your spotify Account.
Set up your workout plan.
You can set than in the preferences the exact timing for movementes and breaks for each excercise in your workout. 
For each excercise we analyze the bpm of the music and manipulate the list that with the change of the music bpm you get the rythm for your excercise.
As alternative we can work with the volume, it gets quiter when you need to do a break and gets louder when your excercise goes on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use the
                    <strong>
                        spotify API
                    </strong>
                    to download the play lists from spotify. Get 30 secounds previews of all songs.
Use the
                    <strong>
                        Fraunhofer MusicBricksIDMTTranscriber
                    </strong>
                    to generate a Trackanalysis which provides the information which parts of a Track have which bpm. All the information track positions and genre get send through a JSON to the Frontend.
The Frontend is build native for android and uses the JSON to generate the mix out of it. If the bpm change is not possible it works with the volume change.
