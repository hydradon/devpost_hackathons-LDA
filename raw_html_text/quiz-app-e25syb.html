                    Inspiration - I needed something on my resume.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - It takes questions and answers and stores them for the users to test themselves.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - I wrote a bunch of pseudo-code before putting it into actual code. I used a bunch of buttons.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - I couldn't get the question to display the right answer, I didn't know how to do a lot of the stuff needed to implement the program so I did a lot of googling.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - I managed to write the code, but there are a few things I couldn't implement properly such as making the questions not repeat. Debugging it was fun too.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - More stuff about GUI.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quiz app - Because the only way I know how to tell the user they got the question correct is if they type the answer exactly as it is stated, I want to add a button to allow themselves to give themselves a point if they feel like they got it right. Make it look neater.
