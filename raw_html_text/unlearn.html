                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a youth, we are constantly bombarded with body images and stereotypes that we &ldquo;should&rdquo; be or follow. Stereotypes also create and endorse the idea that if you don&rsquo;t look and act a certain way your going to be an outcast or you&rsquo;ll just be tossed to the side, and never paid attention to. Making it sensible that stereotypes and body image do fit together like pieces in a puzzle. These stigmas can be demoralizing and depressing and have known to cause psychological as well as eating orders among groups of all ages. Hence, 'Unlearn' provides  a chance to un-learn these stereotypes by drawing inspiration from people who are just like us and who are not letting these stereotypes weigh them down.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simple chrome extension that displays a body image quote every time you open a new app in the browser. Hence, it provides you inspiration, positive vibes and strength of countless other women as examples, to be confident of yourself and fight depression and various disorders.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using html, css, jquery, javascript and microsoft's bing image search API. There are various tutorials available to make chrome extensions but there wasn't much resources available to debug the API errors.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team disbanded a few hours into the hackathon due to different interests. I wanted to build an android app to help women deal with post-partum depression but after infinite unsuccessful tries to fix firebase and limited time and (wo)manpower, I thought of making this chrome extension as it caters towards health and wellness and also since I am a huge fan of these extensions. This was my first web project and dealing with JS and HTTP Requests was a little painful :(

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Making my first successful web app and making it through to demo it. This idea that although came under stress and pressure, can be a great side project integrating more APIs and widgets. So I am looking forward to all that ish ;)
