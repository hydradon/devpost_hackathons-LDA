                    We have created a hack that provides guidance to people with visual impairment while using public transportation. Our app uses voice announcements to help users get on buses safely at the bus stops and then, using the location of the user, inform them when they are approaching a bus stop. The user is informed on reaching their destination so that the user can alight on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often see visually impaired people struggling with their daily lives. Once standing on a bus stand, we realised how a simple task such as just boarding a bus with such disabilities face many difficulties and we wanted to do something to make their life easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, we were inspired to create this app so that visually impaired people can use public transport without too many difficulties, trying to make their lives easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created an app that speaks to the user using voice announcements so that they are aware of their location and can alight on time, safely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &bull; Information will be given using voice announcements a to the user regarding the location of buses on the stop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &bull;The app will inform the user when the doors are opening/closing to denote the arrival of the bus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &bull; Voice messages will be played on reaching a bus stop using the location of the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &bull; Messages will be given continuously to the passenger so they can alight safely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our hack using Java on Android Studio and tested it on Android Emulators before using it on real phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us is very proficient in using Android Studio and so we faced difficulties in incorporating various functions into our mobile app such as GPS and gyroscopic sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud that we were able to learn how to use Android Studio to develop our app even though it can be very challenging and intimidating for beginners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt Android Studio, debugging our code and various techniques to make our code more small and efficient in the last twenty-four hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Automatic Guidance System for the Visually Impaired
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project could be expanded from voice guidance to include Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to guide the visually impaired people with the tasks of their daily life.
