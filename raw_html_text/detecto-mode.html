                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Documenting and analyzing a crime scene is very tedious and difficult task. There are many things that hinder a crime scene investigator to properly do their job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First off, photographs are a common method to document pieces of evidence in a crime. However, often times, disjointed pieces of imagery do not give the investigators the full picture. There is a possibility where a few photos were taking at the crime scene and they require closeups of pieces of evidence that are no longer available to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Detecto Mode is a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) crime scene annotation tool that allows investigators to spatially map out crime scenes and document pieces of evidence. This tool allows a crime scene investigator to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spatially map the environment in real time, using AR
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Collaborate with other crime scene investigators to place notes, highlight important pieces of evidence in AR.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use collected data points from notes and spatial mapping be sent to the cloud, to be processed at the police station.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this hackathon, we were using a lot of technology such as spatial mapping (photogrammetry) and networking. There were are a lot of problems when it came to setting up these technologies to work into Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully combine two technologies that we as a team were completely unfamiliar with. In addition, we also made a polished user interface for the final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An important lesson we took away from this hackathon is to spend time understanding and quantifying a problem. Doing proper research will help inform design decisions. In addition, we also learned that time management is a key part of being able to complete a project on time. As a team, we tried to track progress and set milestones during development of the software we were making.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Detecto Mode
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would explore the possibility of using technology such as Computer Vision/Machine Learning to have the software auto tag points of evidence. In addition, we would want to create a backend system that would parse the data collected by the crime scene investigators and create useful graphs and visualizations.
