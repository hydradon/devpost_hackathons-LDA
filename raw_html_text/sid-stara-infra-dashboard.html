                    From zip code based live weather data SiD tries to optimize the optimal region selection and daily workload of the plant watering brigade. This means skipping locations during heavy rainfalls and increased activity during dry periods. SiD also keeps track of each region separately including last watering and rainfall since the last time the plant received attention.

                        Stara
                    </strong>
                    . The application is a web app built with _ Spring Boot _ we use among other services _ Google maps _ and _ OpenWeatherMap API-s _.

                    The build process was riddled with challenges along the way from accessing and interpreting the data from

                    The web application look and usability and the data portrayed is what we poured our soul out for and we are proud of what we accomplished.

                    We learned that Helsinki has a huge amount meticulously collected and very useful data that can open up endless smart solutions in the future. Also as we were working closely with the map of Helsinki, we learned a number of things about the local region.

These include trash collection service manager based on people density information, grass cutting service manager and many others. SiD could become the one source for
