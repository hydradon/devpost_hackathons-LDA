                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really just wanted to see if I could build it. We knew nothing about this sort of program, so we figured we would give it a shot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prints keystrokes into an output file. Cannot detect all keystrokes, and cannot detect shifts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the help of internet tutorials, and our own intuition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the longest time, I couldn't get the output on multiple lines, but eventually we figured out I was using the wrong command and character.

                <p>
                    We learned a LOT!

                    How to protect ourselves from this sort of an attack.

                    We don't plan on doing anything with it, but who knows? Maybe we will!
