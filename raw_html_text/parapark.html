                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After recently acquiring out learner's permits, we discovered how tough and annoying parallel parking was. After doing further research, we found out over 60,000 people are injured each year due to parking incorrectly and hitting others. Thus, we inspired to construct Parapark.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply put, Parapark is an automated car parking system. Its primary functionality is performing an automated parallel park.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the raspberry pi, coded in python, and used 2 ultrasound sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we came across many hardware challenges, including dysfunctional wires and loose screws. After fixing those, we discovered that we did not have a resistor exactly equal to 2k Ohms. Luckily, we used our knowledge in circuits and connected 5 10k Ohm resistors in parallel to achieve the same effect as a 2k Ohm resistor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parapark provides 3 major functionalities: parking midway between 2 cars, turning into a tight parking space, and (the main one), parallel parking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot regarding hardware as well as software. To properly run our program, we used a Microsoft Remote Desktop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Parapark
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further work into this project would include: adding more ultrasound sensors for added accuracy and implementing an AI algorithm to help it make better decisions.
