                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the beginning, our group knew we wanted to create an app. We started by brainstorming ideas of tasks we wished our phones completed on a daily basis. We recognized that shopping is a frequent endeavor that could be improved to be more efficient, cost effective, and enjoyable, so we decided to create an app that focused on this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app includes an account forming platform to save user data (name, email, and password). It also includes functionality to add a user's grocery items to a list, and would be intended to sort them based upon location to form the most efficient shopping plan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Xcode as our sole IDE and used Swift as the programming language. We also included Firebase to save user input in a database. The next version will include use of a Google Search API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the team was unfamiliar with Swift and IOS development, so it took time to become adjusted to these platforms. Also, to include the search function, we attempted to implement a Google Search API; however, we were unable to do so at the time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have established the Firebase to support our login/set-up system and to track user input. Also, we felt accomplished in making a functioning table view system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We become more familiar with Swift and IOS development, such as creating a UI and the code to go with it. Also, we gained experience collaborating with new people and sharing our knowledge through our various skill sets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shoptimize
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to have Shoptimize include a price-comparison system as well as a fully functional location service. Also, we want to incorporate a bar-code scanning tool to allow users to more easily identify products.
