                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having dealt with simpler proc gen before, I decided to look into something a bit more in-depth after early ideas dried out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently generated a single chunk of a map, looking to be make infinitely expandable alter on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wrote my own Diamond-Square algorithm to get the general shape of the map, then implemented a basic renderer and camera controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dealing with Quaternion math in unity can be confusing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It performs reasonable well and generates quite fast considering how quickly I wrote it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refreshed my memory on a lot of different aspects of unity. Learnt a lot about how unity deals with vectors and rotations in different scenarios.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ProcGen Voxel Map
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generating more chunks as the camera moves, colouring the terrain dependent of height, moisture maps etc
Possibly simulating natural processes such as erosion and tectonics.
