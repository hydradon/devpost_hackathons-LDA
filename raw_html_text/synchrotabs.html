                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We grew frustrated with leaving an incomplete form, article, or manga chapter. To regain full connectivity between devices, we created SynchroTabs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It syncs an exact tab state between devices. This includes information such as type fields and page scroll position.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed it as a Google Chrome extension. The front-end was developed using HTML/CSS while the back-end was developed using Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues getting the proper device to be the save state creator while the other device retrieves the content along with the save state creator status. Connection issues made functionality testing difficult since some save states might not have been updated and devices were loading older save states.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a practical app that we will use in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about chrome extension development and the use of sync capabilities.
                </p>

                    What's next for SynchroTabs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polishing it and publishing it to the chrome extension store.
