                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a project that made the process of class registration more efficient for students. Oftentimes, students decide which classes to take depending on the review a professor receives on Rate My Professor. The hassle of navigating to Rate My Professor, searching for the professor, switching tabs, and repeating the process hinders the efficiency of the students' research.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Chrome extension expedites the process of searching for the Rate My Professor (RMP) rating of a particular professor at UCSB by providing a link to the RMP page right to the professor's name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We researched similar projects for inspiration and looked at various strategies they used to accomplish a similar goal. We used Javascript to build our Chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are both beginners and we were unfamiliar with coding. It was difficult to figure out where to start, but after some research, we were able to gain momentum. We ran into difficulties getting professors whose first initial and/or middle initial were listed as RMP did not return a result in those cases. With the help of mentors at Womxn/Hacks, we were able to troubleshoot and resolve the issues.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned, we're both beginners, and we're both extremely proud to have just taken an idea from inception to execution. At some points, we didn't think we would be able to complete the project, so we are pleased that we were able to finish the extension.

                <p>
                    We would love to be able to integrate the actual rating onto the GOLD page next to the professor name in order to remove the additional step of redirecting to a new tab.
