                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help students such ourselves improve their grade and allow them to study efficiently. Students often have difficulty finding resources to help them learn more. Giving students resources to study will make them motivated to do even better as they see themselves improve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program takes an image of the students' grade book and identifies what category the students need help with, it then sends the student the three most relevant links in order to help them study.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Python program initially stores all the user input (the grades of the students in the class for the specific assignments). Now, using the Google API, we turn this user input from an image to text. Then we come back to our code to look over this text and suggest the user the links off google that correspond to the subject with the lowest grade. The lowest grade calculations are done when the Google API returns the text. Ultimately, we are left with the 3 links that can be used by the user to study.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, we were able to solve several problems with the help of online resources as well as the motivated minds here at HOOHACKS. To be more concise, we created a website in HTML and our web-app was created in Python. In order to create our product, we had to find a way to integrate the Python code into the HTML website. Adding on, we also had to learn some more regarding HTML and CSS to create the final website.
                </p>

                    What's next for Grade Saver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, we have not incorporated the date aspect of when the assignments were assigned. In the future, adding in a time sense would allow for timely mannered info to help the student in the current topics of the class. Furthermore, the program would log into the grade book automatically, and automatically take a picture of the site.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this experience, we were able to improve our teamwork and speaking skill while partaking in intense group discussions. We were also able to learn a lot more related to several different concepts in CS. For example, we furthered our knowledge of CSS and HTML in the process of making the website. We were also able to get exposure to new APIs which have unbelievable amounts of potential.
