                    Countless students every year reach out looking for friends on campus. However, there really isn't a tool that allows them to comfortably find people or meetups that are local on campus.

                    FindTheLighthouse.com will focus on your campus when you register to join your school on the site. You will be able to see only people from your campus. Furthermore, your name is hidden, only your username is visible to others.

                    Challenges I ran into

                    The search functionality was a challenge.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first time we worked on a project using the Django framework was last year for a Software Engineering class, and we felt like we really didn't know what we were doing. For this project we were significantly more confident and the construction of the web app felt much more natural.

                    We are now more experienced with deploying on a virtual machine on Microsoft Azure.
