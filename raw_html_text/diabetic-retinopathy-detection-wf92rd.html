                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since many people are facing eye diseases i did this task so that even if i spent some time on this i would like to save a millions of lives who have this disease and to get cure before they get permanent blindness
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It predicts the which of the 5 levels are affected in their eye
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this with Tensorflow and keras.I did image processing with opencv.I got this data from kaggle website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Image resizing.Image localizations.Which features predicts the level of disease
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I trained this image and i get an upto some level of accuracy that it predicts the disease level correctly on a not-seen image
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned Convolution neural network,opencv and how to preprocess the images before giving it into the training neural network
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve my accuracy score so that it predicts even more correctly
                </p>
