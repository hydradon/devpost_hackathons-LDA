                    Infected with an idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The last thing a college student needs in their busy lives is getting sick, yet the population of a university campus will always pose a threat for the health of a student. It is difficult for students to completely avoid the exchange of germs on a campus, especially with the lack of concrete information on germs in an area. FLUCI was born out of a desire for this to change, and to keep the campus healthy through community involvement and mutual care.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Dynamic Cough Heatmaps
                    </strong>
                    FLUCI pinpoints potential flu hotspots at and around UCI and displays these areas as dynamic heatmaps. The Google Maps and Google Places APIs allow for location precision.

                        Collaborative Data
                    </strong>
                    Data for heatmaps is generated entirely from the collaborative efforts of UCI students, who are able to report where they saw someone cough. Maps are updated as soon as user input is received.

                    We developed a website that is free from clutter, and contains only the absolute necessary information. Visuals are kept simple and intuitive to ensure a pleasurable user experience.

                    </strong>
                    FLUCI also provides tips for maintaining health and avoiding illnesses. A brief UCI SHC health safety overview section gives succinct advice for real-life tips on how to manage and avoid spreading illness.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is developed using the Google Maps API to provide accurate locations of popular areas on the UC Irvine campus. We then use Google's API to create a heatmap layer on top of the map of the UCI campus in order to show all the data we have collaboratively gathered from UCI students.

                    The current release build of FLUCI was developed with the use of the following software tools:

                <h2>
                    Challenges that made us feel sick
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge that the FLUCI team faced was everyone's inexperience with web development and Javascript. Saving heatmaps, how servers communicate with HTML files, manipulating JSON files and arrays, complexity with communicating with servers, and figuring out how to create a slick-looking modern front-end to display all our information were things we had to grapple with. FLUCI's front-end was the number one priority -- nobody wants to use a web app that looks ugly. For a group of CS students who had never done web design before, looking at other sample websites online and borrowing some good traits we found helped us overcome the challenge of having to find a good looking design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments and learning moments that are nothing to sneeze at
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the numerous challenges that presented themselves to us, we were able to gain invaluable experience in web development, and learned how to implement an unfamiliar programming language into a working application. Some of our more inexperienced members were also able to successfully utilize an API for the first time. The FLUCI team is extremely proud of how we were able to complement each other so well, dividing tasks based on each member's strengths.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Diagnosis for the future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to provide detailed and easily accessible statistics for our users, including metrics such as recent hotspots for sickness on campus, number of reports over time, and times during the day which see the most activity in certain areas. These detailed statistics and other visualizations of this data will be made available via the application sidebar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While FLUCI was developed with UCI students in mind, we are open to expanding our services to other campuses.
