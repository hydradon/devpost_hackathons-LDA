                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started saving money for a trip to Helsinki back in June, planning to participate in both Slush and Junction. I downloaded the best-reviewed savings app from the app store and entered my goal. The only two things it showed me were a percentage indicating progress and the amount of money saved. It wasn't very convenient to enter every revenue and savings transaction, but most noticeably it didn't say how to save money. Thus, not removing the stress factor from savings that was actually the cause of me stopping to save for the trip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nordea opened up their API so we can get info on user's revenue and spending habits without any user input - why not solve this problem?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        And that's exactly what we did.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rebudget solves this problem by giving a dynamic saving amount suggestion that the user CAN and SHOULD follow to reach its goal. The app also informs the user on the areas where the user could save money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So it gives the user a stressless and precise way to save.
                </p>

                    Competitive advantages
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are the only app on the market that tracks all the spendings automatically (since we have access to Nordea's API), categorizing them and giving the user precise pieces of advice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took out Omer's (our AI dev) spending data from his main account for the last 3 months and we tried to discover some patterns in it

                        link
                    </a>
                    &lt;--- here's what we found. We then categorized the spendings into 9 categories that we pushed into the middleware alongside the spendings and time patterns for these categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the middleware, we merged this pattern data with Nordea's API data on revenue and spendings and then sent it to the Android front-end that we had designed and coded while the data was being analyzed.
