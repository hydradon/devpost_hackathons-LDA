                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One night I was sitting in my dorm room and needed help with my calculus homework. I was certain that someone nearby could help me, but there was no way for me to connect with them. This is how Studor was born. I have always wanted a service like this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply put, Studor is the Uber of tutoring. Studor is a platform that seamlessly connects students and tutors instantly. Through an easy to use website and app, students find tutors based on subject, location, and price to book a session effortlessly. In addition, students can see what tutors are available around them on a map and meet up instantly.

                    Finding the proper user flow and experience was a challenge as there are so many different directions this can go.

                <p>
                    I am proud of the team for working so well together. Not only do I think we&rsquo;ve built something great, but I&rsquo;ve learned a lot tonight. Utilizing several APIs has made our  product more reliable and capable.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The best way to connect students and tutors is through location. Location is a very powerful. There are several APIs, such as Nexmo and Gimbal that can make this service even better.

                    Studor will hopefully be deployed in New York City and then all over the United States to help those who want to learn instantly. We hope Studor can change the way we think about tutoring.
