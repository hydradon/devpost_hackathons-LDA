                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all native to countries outside the UK and often search for places to visit or consider moving to. However, we have found that current tools do not give us a good overview of a specific location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presents points of interest (e.g.  food, social areas, etc.) near a selected area, crime statistics, weather data, broadband connection speed, etc.
Allows the user to select the place they want to search for.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding APIs that would provide us with free data.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Encompassing lots of different APIs into a usable, easy to read dashboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APIs can be expensive!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue developing the product and introduce new information areas that would be of benefit. This includes creating different pre-set profiles that would auto select a range of points of interest to be displayed.
