                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I saw a Youtube video a while back showing how the developers of a kart racing game implemented their vehicle physics. I also wanted to get into unity and I thought that trying to create my own system would be a fun challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simple game where you race around a circuit going through checkpoints to prevent your timer from reaching 0. The timing grows increasingly strict as you continue. Your score is based on the amount of time you keep the timer from reaching 0.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I developed the game using Unity and C#. Various art assets from the Unity asset store were used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a limited knowledge of Unity so I had to learn how to use it on the fly. I also ran into a few cases where I would need far more time than I had to do what I wanted to do with the physics (IE: a better raycast suspension system)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It somehow runs at a reasonable framerate at a hd resolutions on my surface pro tablet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's tricky to make good feeling vehicle controls under a strict time limit.
