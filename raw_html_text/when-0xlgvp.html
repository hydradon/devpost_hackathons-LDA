                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day, I was told to bring my grand mother's medicines from Walgreens but, my mind diverted to something else. I almost forgot to bring back those medicines. If I had not remembered to buy those medicines while passing through Walgreens. My grandmother could have suffered from my mistake. So, I thought that I, should come up with an app that reminds individuals about their chores. I did some research and found out that nowadays our phone can understand the context around us and can aware us. There are a lot of sensors in our phone which are not used frequently. So, by using those sensors we could know what the phone owner is doing and what it's environment is like. This amazed me and made me come up with an idea that implements my idea. I decided to form a group that will help me create the app.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It analyzes the context around it and provide user with specific actions they want to do which will be triggered with a specific context.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build our Android app. We also used Firebase as a backend for our app.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This concept is new in the market. Google released Apis related to this a year back which is not yet reached to its maximum potential. Since, it's new we faced with compatibility issues with our Android Studio.
