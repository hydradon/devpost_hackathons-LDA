                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rubber duck debugging! Two of our members have large rubber ducks for use in debugging and we came up with a custom encryption scheme.

                    Description
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QuackCryption is a novel approach to data structures, app development, and encryption by four, 2nd-semester Purdue University computer science majors. In essence, either text or a file is inputted (along with maybe a passphrase of the user's choosing), the text is encrypted using 128-bit AES (in CBC mode), and then that text is then converted into 'Quack' code. The data encrypted can be decrypted back to its original form, bit-for-bit. This software is open source.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Primarily in Java (IntelliJ for desktop and backend, Android Studio for Android app) with JavaScript for the web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Converting files into quacks (essentially creating a data structure) was extremely difficult as we had to read in data one byte at a time. File structures were not very intuitive to work with. Maintaining file name across encryption/decryption was extremely arduous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Documenting and standardizing one data structure (the .quack data structure) across all of the platforms was extremely difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Java's Swing package was extremely difficult to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The web app is mostly non-functional. It works to some extent (text can be quacked and unquacked across sessions) but is not interoperable across other QuackCryption products.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Java's Swing package, graphic design, AES encryption, and data structures/encrypted data structures.
