                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's common knowledge that female entrepreneurs and small business owners have been the minority in the business world for far too long. Women need to be encouraged to start businesses and then once started, to keep them. We were inspired to make this app because we wanted to create a place where women would be able to ask questions, get answers, tips, and advice when roadblocks arise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is creating a network to give small business owners and women entrepreneurs an outlet to communicate with mentors, facilitators, and local government. Not only will owners receive advice and helpful tips, but input from fellow owners with groups. Groups can be created to allow owners, mentors, and facilitators with similar knowledge or information to work together providing users with multiple perspectives and support that can help in developing their businesses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html, css and javascript for building the front end of the website, and python Django on the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a long time trying to decide what framework to use for our project. We considered using React.js which none of us knew how to use, and we spent a good amount of time trying to set it up. Eventually, we made a decision to use vanilla javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of putting this project together in such a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We researched quite a bit about the process of starting a small business and the different entities involved in that process. We learned that local governments take part in supporting small business owners by providing different funding opportunities. We also tried to dissect the issue of shortage of female entrepreneurs and what factors affect the percentage of women among business owners. We looked at the statistics for the number of women business owners and were surprised by what we found.
For some of us it was the first hackathon and we learned how to write GitHub code, and deepened our understanding of html. We also learned a lot about the impact small businesses have on the economy, and how women are deeply underrepresented.
                </p>

                    What's next for Leveraging the First Steps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We see this application having long-term benefits for many businesses owners and entrepreneurs. It&rsquo;s a network for people to connect and help each other. This includes guidance in the best places for starting a small business. Oklahoma City, OH is the best city, other good cities are Salt Lake City, UT, Charlotte, NC, and Tulsa, OH.
