                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many a time, I have walked through a wegmans, wandering aimlessly, nowhere to go, unsure what to do. Now with speedy snacks you can be in and out as fast as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides you with an optimal path through wegmans to find all of your groceries
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the location feature of wegmans combined with heuristics based on wegmans layouts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up an account system proved harder than expected. Also obtaining data from the wegmans API was a little strange because I had to try 3 different methods of sending requests because they kept returning junk information in the request body
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The real time rendering of the wegmans map with your food locations on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Relearned much about programming in javascript as well as many mistakes to avoid in the future
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Speedy Snacks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventually we think that by applying OCR technology to the layouts of wegmans stores online we could get an even more accurate layout for even faster shopping
                </p>
