                    LateX/Python hybrid that symbolically solves equations on the fly. Works for most integrals and derivatives. The basic syntax is as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    $$ {expression} = \eval{expression} $$
                </p>
                <p>
                    The symbolic computation is performed over SymPy
                </p>

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're Physics/Math/Astronomy majors and writing LaTeX reports for upper division homeworks is a nasty part of the job description - especially since the integrals tend to get extremely cumbersome. In response, we wrote a LaTeX module that feeds your derivatives and indefinite integrals through an open source symbolic processor (SymPy) and inserts it - formatted - into your LaTeX document with a single command (\eval).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a parser that takes a LaTeX input string, parses it into a format that SymPy can work with and then process the output back into LaTeX. We also defined a latex routine that calls said Python script and feeds the answer back into the string with a single command
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challanges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Math has a lot of different ways of writing things. These materialized as corner cases that we had to painstakingly debug one at a time. The parser also uses a significant amount of regex - and all the associated nastiness
