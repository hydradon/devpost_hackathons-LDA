                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all come from different backgrounds. When trying to come up with a common ground, we ended up with something cyber security related.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deceptic scans any and all files being uploaded to a Cloud service or any server, and compares them to an established database containing various malware signatures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Deceptic, you can choose a file to upload. Once you upload it, we'll run it through our scanners, and if it contains malware, we'll tell you. Otherwise, we'll push it to OneDrive for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python for the backend mostly. We used raw python and postgresql to handle and compare malware, and flask to create the web interface. We used the Microsoft OneDrive API to store files in the cloud. We also used metasploit to generate malware shell code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our most challenging obstacle during our creation of Deceptic, was using and setting up Microsoft's OneDrive API. Struggling to connect with the API using OAuth which was tedious and time consuming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We eventually sort of got the OneDrive thing down. We think our parsing of metasploit malware into database entries was pretty unique and interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about file encoding in hex. Additionally, we learned about some algorithms to compare really long strings. Throughout our process of creating Deceptic, we learned more about using HTTP requests to communicate with an API using oauth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Deceptic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the future, we want to implement machine learning, and pattern recognition through Yara, so more intricate and complex malware can be detected. We also want to implement our software through multiple platforms not only for OneDrive but also for other cloud services.
