                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communities around the world know that there isn't enough money to pay for everything, which includes happy and healthy people, and a clean, safe, sustainably managed environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This DApp will empower governments, NGOs, networks, and alliances around collective impact to organize around social and environmental goals, and compensate people for their contributions making the world a better place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've piloted this mechanism twice in Iowa, and we've seen numerous other applications of it in countries in Europe. Essentially all we need to do is identify the goals a given community has, the partners working together to achieve those, and the measurable activities people can perform to move things in the right direction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't code. I'm a political economist, community organizer, and "why" person. I need the support of "how" and "what" people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The similar program I designed and piloted was featured in the Money &amp; Life documentary as an example of a new kind of money putting people and planet before tunnel-vision focus on short term profits. Since then I've been named the "US Fellow" of Qoin, an Amsterdam based "agency for community currencies", project manager for the very new "Complementary Economics Foundation" born out of the global barter and trade industry's "International Reciprocal Trade Association", and most recently an advisor to Project Forward.
                </p>

                    What's next for Project Forward
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building our network, creating a proof of concept and mockup, and getting funding for real-world applications working with aforementioned partners on the ground. Generally making it real, and taking it to Main Street.
