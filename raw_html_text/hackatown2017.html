                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app that would revolutionnize the way we help each other, by creating a community of caring people, available at the touch of your finger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an app that allows the user to request assistance, either for himself or for someone else in medical need, or being the victim of an aggression. Then, the other users that are near receive a push notification qith the GPS coordinate indicating the position of someone who needs assistance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the PhoneGap platform to develop a cross-platform web application and a C# ASP.NET 4.5 WebApi fr the backend service
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems deploying an AWS EC2 instance, and one of our memeber lost 2 hours trying to deploy the website and database on it, to finally give up and use another hosting service. We also had problem because we tried using new technologies we weren't familiar with. Oh, we also had problem staying awake...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think the idea is great, and our prototype is really neat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should come more prepared and use technologies we already know, not try to learn on the spot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Heroes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't know where the world will lead us.
