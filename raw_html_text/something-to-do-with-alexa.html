                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Life is so busy working out where to get next needs a bit of reminding. When you get used to a busy life and suddenly have a moment to have a divergent thought, or just know the best use of time.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, just being friendly providing oblique strategy suggestions when you ask for the plan and help divergent thinking. Really it should become the all round strategist that can provide actionable suggestions.

                    Setting up took longer than I thought (they always do!) and the skill didn't sync to my app for a while.
