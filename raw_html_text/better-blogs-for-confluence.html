                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At Twitter we had the internal Engineering Blog on Confluence. We used it to communicate across 2,000 people in Product, Design and Engineering. VP's sent out their updates on this blog, we shared our Tech Radar on this blog, and people talked about diversity initiatives on this blog (amongst all manner of topics).
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we had one challenge - getting Tweeps to subscribe to the blog and stay abreast of the latest developments. You see, Confluence only allows individuals to subscribe to a blog, not groups like 'all-eng'.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better Blogs for Confluence allows a Confluence Space Administrator to subscribe a group to watch and be notified of new blogs in a space. At Twitter this means that every member of the Product, Design and Engineering group would get an email notifying them of a new post by the VP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Atlassian SDK, a REST API, javascript and a new template for the email notification (AUI compliant).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This solves a key problem I faced at Twitter. Looking forward to it being used for the Engineering Blog, and for updates from Jack and his staff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Better Blogs for Confluence
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better Blogs is more than just notifications for groups of people. The next two releases will have some exciting features for publishers - stay tuned for more, secret for now.
