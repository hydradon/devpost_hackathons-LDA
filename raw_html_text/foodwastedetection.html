                    The Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food is one of our basic necessities. But there exists a huge problem, on one hand, people struggle to get even a meal's supply, on the other hand, there is wastage of food on a daily basis. We identified this problem in our college dining halls, and this is not just limited to dining halls but to any place where food is served. We set forward to actually analyze this wastage, create awareness about it and to provide inferences in order to reduce it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Steps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We start with installing cameras in the plate drop off area in the dining halls. One pointing towards the place where the plate is dropped and the second pointing towards the face of the person dropping off the plate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) For the purpose of demonstration, we limited ourselves to just one food item - Penne Pasta and quantity limited to four distinct measures- empty, quarter, half, full.
