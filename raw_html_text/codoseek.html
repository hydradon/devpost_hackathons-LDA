                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I was being interviewed during my last internship, the interviewer mentioned how it's hard to determine the languages an applicant is proficient in or at least, how proficient they are with the ones they brag about. It's always a bother how recruiting side and applicant cannot get easily matched. Codoseek aims to bridge the gap by summarizing the projects with the programming languages present!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a given github handle, the app presents the repositories with bytes of codes in respective programming language.
                </p>

                    How I built it

                    Tears and Occasional breakdowns (:
Literally coding with the prayers!

                    Kidding... its actually running Express as a server-server backend and Vue as the frontend.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Github API is a real trouble it has a pool of nonsense error whenever you make the calls.

                <p>
                    At least the app is serving its purpose!
I survived the night without supper!

                <p>
                    Actually, this project has so much room to improve, its my management fault that it did not bloom into what I had visualized earlier.
Initially, I intended to validate the information using hashgraphs but well.
