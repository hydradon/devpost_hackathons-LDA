                    This project is a website where students can submit their DARS report of courses they've previously taken and will return a list of minors which the student is close to attaining, in order of closest to furthest attainable minors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website lists information on how many classes and credit hours the student needs to fulfill in order to attain a given minor, as well as provide a list of courses they can/need to take for that minor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UIUC minor information pages as well as DARS reports were parsed using a python library called Beautiful Soup. This information was combined using mysql in order to get a cohesive list of requirements for every minor possible for the student. The website was created using Bootstrap and Flask.
