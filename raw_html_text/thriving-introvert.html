                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am an introvert and have always had hard times fitting in a crowd, i realized I can not live alone and have to interact with people as i perform my daily activities. I also run a small business and I have always avoided some tasks because I feel inadequate. Since I am the owner of the business, I can not be on the background.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used voiceapps platform to develop the skill.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would have really wanted to develop the skill using Alexa kit unfortunately I lacked the necessary skills. I settled for voiceapps which is almost similar to voiceflow.  Outsourcing the development of the skill is expensive for me at the moment.

                <p>
                    Completing the skill. Learning a bit of  APL.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Content is king. All the ideas I have need excellent content which I am working on. I am interested in coming up with multimodal skill. With excellent content, it will be easy to partner with agencies since they can do the development as I come up with the content.
