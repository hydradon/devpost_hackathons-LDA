                    This project is meant to help people practice their drawings skills. Someone who is wearing our device sees something that they think is worth drawing. Our custom haptic wearable has a camera to scan a specific object and classify it. Then, that image is sent via Bluetooth to the user's phone, and then relayed to our server. The server analyzes the image using TensorFlow and returns the labels to the user's phone. These labels are used to direct the user to specific, simple tutorials in drawing relevant objects. Once they start using the tutorial, the haptic feedback in the wristband alerts them for errors they are making, allowing them to improve over time.
