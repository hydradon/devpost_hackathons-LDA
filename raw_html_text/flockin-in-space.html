                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by
                    <strong>
                        birds
                    </strong>
                    . Their organizational patterns, known as flocking, helped us design the patterns for the ships in our designs. We also looked at problems with space travel such as orbital space junk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a 2D simulation of autonomous spaceships traversing through a plane. These planes seek to fly together, like birds, to remain organized. The purpose of the organization of these spaceships is to diminish the problems already present in space travel. We organized three modes space mode, atmospheric mode, and junk mode. Space mode is used to simulate the situation of other asteroids being present while these spaceships are navigating through the area. Atmospheric mode is used to simulate the spaceships handling of Earths atmosphere. Junk mode is used to clear space junk in space left by other spaceships. No collisions. No space junk. No Damage.
                    <em>
                        Our overall purpose is to simulate the solution to orbital space junk
                    </em>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Java and processing libraries. We also had various variables to control the ships. These variables being Cohesion, Alignment, and Separation. Cohesion is used to steer to move toward the average position of local flock mates. Alignment is used for steering towards the same destination of local flock mates. Separation is used to steer and avoid conflicting with other flock mates. The UI can be used to control all these variables.
