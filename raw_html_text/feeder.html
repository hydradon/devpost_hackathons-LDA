                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration for this project hit one day before grocery shopping when I saw my mom pull out a box of index cards with recipies on them, muttering "what havent we had in a while..." to herself while flipping through them. I decided I was going to create an easier way for her with my own two hands.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program stores your recipies and restaurants you like, and psudorandomply draws from this data to plan your week's meals. It will not give duplicate choices within a week or on back-to-back weeks. It plans out 8 meals for 7 days tooffer flexability within the week on what you want to eat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this in JAVA in the Eclipse Keplar IDE, along with my fingers, my laptop, sleep depravation, and a toxic level of caffine in my blood for almost 35 hours by the time you're reading this.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Methods that gave me a hard time were the io formatting, the restrictions on the randomization, and the compiling of the ingrediants into a single printed list.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It may not be pretty yet, but it's fully functional. And I didn't kill myself in the process so that's a thing too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that by far the biggest pain in the kiester is trying to figure out within 15min of waking up, what the heck you were thinking when you wrote something 3hrs ago that makes no sense whatsoever.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Feeder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GUI's! The next step is to add a GUI and have the program live as an .exe file, not depending on any IDE  to run on your computer. After that? Phones! It's going to be a full blown app when I'm done with it.
