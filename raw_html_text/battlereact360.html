                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After reviewing what I was able to do with the examples in React360, I realized that finally this technology was able to fuse VR, OpenGL and Web in a very simple way. I've tried to achieve this years ago using old technologies like Java3D and JavaApplets but they failed since the environment configuration was complex. Now even a simple cellphone has a powerful OpenGL implementation and movement sensors. So it was time to create a game. So I decided to create something simple, something reusable, so the idea of a GAME ENGINE came to my mind. First I would need a game to develop as an example. But there was not too much time, so I remembered one of my favorites NES Game,

                        Battle City
                    </a>
                    . A pretty good game about tanks in a city moving around. Simple enough since tanks don't have too much animations and creating a city with building so you can move your head or device to explore it and find your enemy.

                    Reviewing the React360 GitHub repository was a great help and years of experience in other Game Engines like Unity3d allowed me to create this basic architecture. Check the image gallery to see a pretty basic architecture diagram.

                <p>
                    Communication between components was one of the major challenges. Since I had no experience with React nor React360 it took me a lot of time to understand the whole process.

                    I was not very fancy of JavaScript but now with the new generation of specification that allow classes and frameworks like React and React360, it completely changed my mind.

                <p>
                    The game has a lot of Features to be added. Enemies, Firing, Map creation and sharing. Since the map concept is simple as matrix of number, this could be encoded as a HASH in the URL to share with your friends so they can enjoy any map creation or even to improve it. Multiplayer, Sound FX, Texture and Model improvement...
