                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that a lot of data that the Vessel Captain need to log are repetitive data that can be automated/prefilled before the journey, as well as data captured from mobile device or the internet. We seek to help them log their journey more intuitively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nemo is a chat interface that automate a lot of the manual process of writing a log book. The UX is tailored for a smooth and intuitive mobile experience for data entry. We incentive the act of data entry via rewarding micro-interaction, as well as giving actionable warnings and data validation such that data entry for Vessel Captain becomes fast, clean and enjoyable!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nemo is also built on top of a fully localizable architecture. The hackathon demo feature 3 demo lanuage: EN (US), VN (Vietnamese), and RS (Serbian). But wait, there's more! Although Nemo's user interface language is localized for the captain's nationality, the root key of each data piece are separated, allowing inter-operable across language via the FAO 3A_Code (This feature is demoed briefly in the current MVP of Nemo).

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React to create this demo

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't know anything about how data-entry are being handled by current vessel captain. We struggle a lot when designing our front-end, but thanks to the insight from our mentor Neil Aeschliman, we managed to deliver something adequate.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hacking on an unfamiliar domain and managed to deliver a solution that fit some of the challenge.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about the operation of fishery captain, what data they need to log and how to streamline the data. Creating an entire chat bot and the architecture for localization across language. A lot about FAO code as well.

                    What's next for SeaTrace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will definitely polish the application as well as making it native compliant so that it can be used in the ocean if there's interest of using it in the field.
