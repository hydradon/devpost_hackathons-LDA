                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a mixed reality chess set during our last hackathon and we wanted to stretch boundaries and not limit ourselves. As a result, we decided to build a VR Horror House Game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user experiences a real situation where he/she is trapped in a spooky house and is running against time to solve a puzzle and get out of the house before being devoured by the monster. The game uses Oculus Rift VR set and an Xbox controller for the gameplay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With very little Unity experience, the team members collaborated heavily to build the project. Designing as well as creating the objects to be included in the gameplay was challenging. Coding and making the first person control was also difficult to handle. Incorporation of sound effects as well as use of lighting technology invokes a step ahead of being trapped in a mystery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Handling VR motion sickness
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating objects and modelling them to the gameplay.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Extensive version control issues due to excessive meta data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integration of sound at specific points in the gameplay
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    One of the most important challenge we ran into was "designing" objects. Alongside actually writing code, we had to model and consider placing objects and applying Physics to them in the space. This was one of the most fun challenges we came across.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smooth working of the game. We actually did not think it would be possible for us to create the entire game. However, we managed to create a remarkable gameplay experience within 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a VR application involves more than coding. As software developers, you are required to think extensively and long term goals. This project involved exactly that. Dependency on other team member requires trust and that can be achieved by hardwork and power naps!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Haunted House Game in VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the horror game that we built - we don't intend to move forward, however we have some really cool VR ideas in mind for the future. Stay Tuned!
