                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As finals are coming up, we thought about how we use final grade calculators every semester to know what we need on our finals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It calculates how much you need to get on your final based on the grades you find on BlackBoard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have any experience with Javascript and limited experience with Html with the group, so we spent quite a while trying to figure it out as well as the calculations to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of getting it to work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the syntax behind Javascript and Html and also how to calculate grades.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Final Grade Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This can be applied as a widget for all classes so students can use it at the end of the semester.
