                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Carpools are economically smart, and environmentally friendly. My partner Austin and I have both been in many carpools due to our long commute to TJ every day, and we realized that people seemed to always have trouble remembering when there day was, or even finding a carpool near them. We wanted to solve this problem with our great app: CarPlan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CarPlan allows users to create a unique account, then find local carpools around them. They can request to join the carpool groups, and once joined they will be reminded when they are supposed to pick up or drop off the other members of the group. Users can also create their own carpool groups, and invite other users to join their groups.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I personally ran into large problems with my laptop not being able to run GitHub GUI properly, and not being able to run the Android Studio emulator. Thus making it very very difficult to make progress toward my teams' app. In general, our team had difficulties using the SQLite database with android to set up users/groups.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I learned how to use the Git command prompt, and was able to do the Git processes that I needed for version control through the command line. I had to learn all the methods, and how to use the command prompt.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of things. I had never been to a hackathon before, and I learned that they are a lot of fun, and that I want to go to more! Just next time I'll be sure to bring a pillow and a sleeping bag. Also I learned something completely new for me, the Git command prompt. I also learned that I need to make sure that my computer can run the android emulator if I want to code an android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CarPlan?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran out of time and were unable to fully implement some features of the app, but we are planning in the future to build in more social features allowing users to message each other on the app, plans for finding the most efficient route from pick up areas to all members' houses, and all members' houses to a drop off area.
