                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to build an application that helped farmers realize larger crop yields, while at the same time incentivizing better and more sustainable agricultural practices and ecological stewardship.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses imaging, and hopefully eventually, sensor-equipped drones to regularly monitor farms and determine field health through machine-learning data gleaned over time from work with farmers. Farmers get incentivized via proof of work - either by improving their farms or by providing feedback data to the network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Largely front-end at the moment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Logistics - we will likely need to build our own coin (on an existing smart coin like EOS or Ethereum) to make this all possible.
