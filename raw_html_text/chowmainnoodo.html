                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the spaceX hyperloop contest. I realized that by making these great ideas open sourced, we can gather the creativity and expertise of a huge range of people to refine a certain idea to its highest potential.

                    What it do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows any organization or individual to list an idea they believe to be important. People can then enter design competitions for this idea, and the host selects a winner.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using internet resources and html
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging learning html from the start. Also, I had to work by myself beause I didn't feel passionate about my former team's idea, as I had failed to convince them of my idea. Thus, I had to use my limited skill set to build an incomplete product that has massive potential.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to develop the website furthur, as it is barely functional right now. Also, I would like to add more functions such as a group chat where people can discuss smart ideas and work together. Finally, i would like to actually make Chowmainnoodo into a functional startup.
