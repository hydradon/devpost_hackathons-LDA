                        We have seen rural people transportation challenges.

                    <li>
                        In urban areas we ourselves have experienced many challenges everyday while commuting.

                    <li>
                        Cause public transport is the future.

                    <li>
                        Our system tracks vehicles which are used for public transport systems to inform users/commuters where the desired bus/vehicle is currently located.

                    <li>
                        Cause this app is also used in rural area we kept in mind non-functional requirements so it was built using feature phone running on KaiOS.

                    <li>
                        We also integrated google map API for navigation.
