                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for BeatMatrix was that people today love music but have no true way to connect with their audio. And so, we created the app so that users can tap to the beat of their favorite songs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application flows beats through based on the beat of the song given and the user must tap on the screen on the exact right moment, when the dot is on the line so that the user can gain points. Based on how well the user knows the song and the beats of the song, the user gets more and more points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java to built both the back end and front end but with pretty liberal use of APIs. Our first order of business was to find a way to read music and analyze it. This we did with the JFuge API. Then we needed to find how to find beat drips and transfer that into visual dots. Then we built the back end to track the players keystrokes and playing game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was creating an algorithm to analyze the music and beat drops.
The back end design to run the music and dots side by side.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy that we can visualize a connection between music and user happiness; users can visually see their connection to music increase as they play on the application more and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the best ideas for on the application are best on the simplest needs; people want to score their connection to mainstream concepts, and BeatMatrix does that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BeatMatrix
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to incorporate more APIs that will the basic theme of beats in a more engaging game. We will also extend  the application to a mobile environment.
