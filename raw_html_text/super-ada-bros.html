                    I was browsing the web looking for existing assistive technology to get
inspiration. I came across the

                    as one of the top upvoted posts of all time. As a gamer myself, I thought
this would a great and fun idea to try and implement as an actual game.

                <p>
                    While I had the theme of accessibility at that point, it didn't actually
have any accessibility features. My friend suggested the idea of using eye
tracking from

                    . I looked into it and
ultimately decided on using head tracking for more stability and control.

                    It is essentially a clone of the original Super Mario Bros, but with the
twist that he can't jump. So, there are ramps and lifts to make up for it.
There are also a variety of input methods to suit whatever method is most
comfortable for the user:

                    . Take note of the fact that there may be existing bugs in the release due to time constraint. There is also a built-in checkpoint system that moves you on to next the checkpoint (pipe) after 3 deaths, so you can see the whole level without any frustration.

                    How I Built It

                    OpenCV and Godot.

                    Challenges I Ran Into

                <p>
                    Game physics is more complex than I thought it would be, even with it being
a simple 2D platformer.

                <p>
                    Making my first game. I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out given the
amount of time I had.

                <p>
                    Basic game development skills and a bit of visual computing for the face
tracking and game physics.
