                            The educational approach to teaching children with ADD and ADHD doesn't usually take the child's perspective into account. We think it's important to learn how to teach these children in a more effective way by understanding what works for THEM.

                    ADHD in kids has not been explored a great deal, it is rather misconstrued and misinterpreted causing confusion to the care-giver/teacher and the child as well.

                    We built an application to study how ADHD kids learn. This can be used in a classroom environment where educators learn how best to educate them using VR. An attempt is made to try and understand the effectiveness of VR vs. a 2D game( Android based)

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a VR application which introduces a child to a virtual classroom. The child is given a myriad of choices from which she could choose what she's interested in. In our case, we tried incorporating 'Stroop test' based painting activity. The application is supposed to record the choices the child makes. This data is stored on Google Cloud Platform in a cloud SQL database.An attempt is made to visualize this data using ChartIo and derive useful insights regarding child behavior which could be instrumental in tailoring a more effective academic experience for the child.
An android application built on the same lines with the intention of providing a comparison with the VR based methodology. Data is collected from the usage of android app as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope to enable better teaching methods by listening to the user.

                <p>
                    We really enjoyed working with Google Cloud Platform for the first time.
We encountered challenges integrating multiple applications Android/Unity(C#) application with the Google Cloud Platform(Google Cloud SQL) however this has broadened our skill set and increased our eagerness to try out things that we haven't encountered.

                <p>
                    We have worked on three different tech stacks in this hackathon. We are extremely proud that we worked on:
VR with Unity 3D and C#
Android App using Android SDK
Google Cloud Platform using App Engine, Cloud SQL
Data Visualisation using Chartio
                </p>

                    We intend to come up with different challenges incorporated in the VR application that would give us new insights about ADD kids.
