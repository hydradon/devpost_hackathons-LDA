                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were watching a famous youtuber playing the video game called "Erie". It was very entertaining to watch, so we wanted to provide the same kind of entertainment to video gamers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You control a first person controller around an abandoned mental hospital. All patients have turned into zombies, and you are the last survivor. You follow the notes that are provided by the previous survivors to find all seven keys. These seven keys will allow you to escape from the hospital, through a magical rainbow door.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered Unity and decided that it would be fun to learn and build a project. We took disassembled prefabs from the asset store, and we built it all into one massive scene. Then we split up the work: one person codes the player (gun, flashlight, movement, and all interactions), one person designs the horror materials (waypoint zombies, jumpscares, notes, etc), and the last person debugs everything we build.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to make this game into a VR system, which crashed the computer. We had to spend about three hours reinstalling the windows system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a first Unity game, we made a solid story-lined video game with multiple contents. Unity can be a very difficult program to use, but we managed to make a good quality video game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity can be very powerful as long as we make good backups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ZMBZ: Locked iN
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to refine the game's assets and the story line so that it is enjoyable visually and also more fun to play.
