                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the need for conservation and we want to inform people of how the impact of their decisions can affect the environment in bad and good ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The objective of the game is to get the most resources, achieve more advanced civilization through tech tree progression, and maintain a good environment on your planets at the same time. By keeping your planets healthy, you can ensure the planet lasts longer and generate natural resources, maybe even some surprises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each time you build an oil well, factory, or research center, some of the planet's nature is lost and if this is done repeatedly, it causes the planet to lose health and eventually become an uninhabitable desert. The game is over when this happens to one of the planets you built on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players can use their money to buy upgrades such as jet packs and fly through the galaxy and explore unique planets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Average game time is intended to be 15 minutes.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It doesn't do much; this is more of a proof of concept at the moment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered challenges with having players put the factories on the rounded surface of the planet. The factories are to generate money in the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Unity and debugging
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding a game is far harder than we expected. Later, we realized that we could have done something simpler and finished it.
