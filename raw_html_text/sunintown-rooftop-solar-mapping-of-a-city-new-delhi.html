                    We came as a team when it mattered and could implement something in a quick time. 
This kind of data will help to scale solar rooftop installations in cities and help utilities meet their RPO and targeted marketing for System integrators

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More the data, better the results can be. There is a lot of scope for addons, and integrating even a market place in solar etc. Which can be a first of its kind in India.
