                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every time I go to the gym I have had to bring a calculator with me to figure out how much weight is on the bar, and how many plates I need to put on the bar to fulfill my training. When I also have to convert between pound and kilogram plates, it gets even worse! At my gym, every weightlifter or powerlifter I have talked to has mentioned their way of dealing with this issue. Whenever I would mention the idea of making a phone app, every single person responded with enthusiasm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My iOS app converts between pounds and kilos, and displays how many weights should be on each side of the bar with both a kilogram and pound set. My app also allows you to click any plate you want to add to the bar, and it will instantly tell you how much weight that is- in both pounds and kilos, and display that weight on both of the barbells. These are the basic features, there's obviously more to it but this is the basis. The point of this is to speed up workouts and better provide against injuries by ensuring proper loading of barbells. Many people get injured from having mis-loaded bars flip over them, like a catapult, in the middle of their set. My goal is to never let this happen anymore.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Xcode and programmed the app using Swift on my Mac. The hardest part was navigating Xcode! I learned the basics to iOS programming just last week: I read through (most of) Apple's two tutorial books online.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being completely new to iOS apps- and really, computer science in general, as I am a freshman- the hardest part was figuring out the intricacies of Xcode that were, apparently, so well-known that I couldn't find any information about it online. Like how to make something scroll down. That took me 5 hours to figure out!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I will start to use this myself, and everyone I know at the gym will too. I plan on launching this app soon on the App Store once I make it look nicer, and then Ill be even prouder if many other weightlifters and athletes can use it too!

                <p>
                    I learned how to navigate Xcode and actually make an iOS app.

                <p>
                    I will soon put it on the App Store as a totally free app, to help the millions of people who lift weights.
