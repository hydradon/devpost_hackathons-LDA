                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I decided to make this project because I thought, what if I could acquire a rough estimate of what people are feeling about this keyword right now, within a minute? And I wanted to work on a major API for this Hackathon, henceforth I chose to create a project that uses aggregated twitter feed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, using my dev API Keys, I can return a search query on a specific keyword through the Tweepy api, which is a JSON. Then, using Pandas Dataframe I cleaned the data and returned the only the text part of the tweet. Before this, I have already found a dataset for training the logical regression algorithm for text, so I used that to predict and return a meaningful data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Jupyter Notebook, the hallmark of data science platform, and used GitHub to store the project.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quite a few actually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, I worked on this project alone. Now, I'm not a lone wolf type person or anything, but it was something I wanted to try for this Hackathon. This did not turn out as effective as I thought it would be first. I did not have enough expertise to take care of the frontend and the backend of the program under my allotted time, and when I got stuck on a problem, I did not have someone to brainstorm with to come up with creative ways to solve that problem.
That's one of the reasons why there's only a Jupyter Notebook is in the GitHub repo right now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the more technical side, I had problems with using regular expressions, and cleaning a messy data proved harder than it was. There were many other issues with data types that prevented me from doing what I wanted to do, which slowed my progress down significantly.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything said and done, I did reach my end goal in terms of project. Regardless of how frontend looks like right now, at least that's something I can implement later on. Also I attended every workshop possible to gain insight on my project, and that's also something I'm proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is very inefficient to work alone. I need to have a teammate that complements my skills whom I can clearly communicate with. 
I need to improve my personal skills as well. I significantly lack frontend skills. I will dedicate myself to learn HTML/CSS, Javascript, and React.
I need to improve my knowledge on how to use data science related functions: regex, dataframe, logistic regression, etc
Pico-8 is really awesome.
With this in mind I'm going for the win next time.

                    What's next for TwitterAggregateSolution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm going to conduct more tests to see if the trained model is actually working for the aggregated twitter data. 
Then, I'm going to create a frontend for the project in a web environment.
