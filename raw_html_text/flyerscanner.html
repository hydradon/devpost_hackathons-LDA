                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students in college, we see many event posters throughout our day for events that are interesting. However, we often don't have time to stop and figure out all the information about the event before having to continue toward class, missing many events that would be relevant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to simplify the process of noting events and and speed up the process, we decided to create an app that would take a picture and add the relevant event to your calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flyer Scanner was built using the Android APIs using Java. We utilize Machine Learning frameworks hosted by Firebase and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Comprehend to provide Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we also utilized Github to store and coordinate our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have used many modern frameworks to make a lightweight Android app that can be useful for many people in their daily lives - not just limited to students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use many modern technologies such as machine learning, optical character recognition, and natural language processing, while also utilizing the cloud to keep device overhead low.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flyer Scanner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A useful addition to Flyer Scanner would be to port it to iOS as well. This way we would be able to target a larger audience.
