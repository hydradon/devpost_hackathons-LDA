                </h2>
                <p>
                    Phone calls can be frustrating if you're not a native English speaker. Whatever purpose a new English speaker may use this app for (e.g., speaking to customer service), it is our mission to make their lives easier.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        translations of live phone calls with captions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a complete conversation history in text format, with the option to translate
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The conversation history is a versatile feature and may serve very useful for attendees of a large conference call to keep track of what was said!
