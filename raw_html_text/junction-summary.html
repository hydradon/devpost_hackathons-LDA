                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about things that would make the building feel more empathic and a bit of humane.
One of the major points we came up with was the point experience of a visitors of a company.
Therefore we wanted to tackle that visiting experience and how we could make it go as smooth as possible for both the employee that invites the guest as well as the visitor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Evie works as a map of the Tieto building and includes a view for the employee to reserve rooms for a meeting, as well as a view for the guest to collect some information and wishes of said guest (If they'd like to drink or eat something during the meeting) and provide a means of getting is touch with the employee that invited the guest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted the application to be as  as possible, therefore we built the application as a website.
We built the interfaces used in the application using Ionic framework and the backend for the data collection using RethinkDB. We also wanted to include pathing inside the building, so we built a custom pathing application using Dijkstra.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we run into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some minor problems with webRTC phone calls as well as getting the shortest path with Dijkstra.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we actually got something done, since we came to the event with not that much expectations because of other demands during the weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Evie?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to build the user interface to completion (Splitting the admin interface from the guest interface) as well as URL generation and sending for the guest using a generated email and add other functions to the application like connection to the elevators, locks that open for the user, connection for the cafeteria PoS for easier interaction.
