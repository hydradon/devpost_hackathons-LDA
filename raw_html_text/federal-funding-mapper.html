                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with HUD data gives us a great opportunity to look out for less fortunate American citizens, which is what we wanted to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Federal Funding Mapper plots areas of significant homelessness populations. On clicking these areas the user can view information about how much federal funding was received and for what purposes by the areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built in Android Studio, but most of the database work was done outside the project in RStudio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communicating between R and Java was a challenge and so reading the data from databases was very tedious.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
