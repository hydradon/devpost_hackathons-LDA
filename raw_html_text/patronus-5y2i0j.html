                    Dementia is a debilitating condition that affects tens of millions across the globe. In addition to experiencing cognitive decline, those afflicted by dementia are stripped of their autonomy so that loved ones and health care professionals may better keep track of them. Our solution Patronus seeks to provide solutions for all parties involved. Leveraging IoT and machine learning, Patronus provides real-time data as to what patients are experiencing when on their own, relaying that data to loved ones and any salient updates to their registered health care professionals. The algorithm tags audio and image data using Azure Cognitive Services and Google Colab, and synthesizes the tags into sentences that can be logged by EMRs. Future developments will aim to capture bio-signals such as heart rate to document situations and settings that elicit agitation in the patient, noting frequency to track cognitive decline over time.
