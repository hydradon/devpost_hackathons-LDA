                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspirations were Black Mirror's
                    <em>
                        Bandersnatch
                    </em>
                    and the World Of Light Classic Mode in
                    <em>
                        Smash Ultimate
                    </em>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an interactive, visual-novel in which every choice you make will affect the path you take.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by brainstorming potential endings. We used Unity and developed the storyline using a flowchart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we're a beginner group, we had to learn how to use Unity on the spot. We experienced merging conflicts that we couldn't resolve, so we ended up working on one computer.
                </p>
