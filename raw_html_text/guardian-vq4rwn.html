                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up in inner-city NYC, safety was always a concern for our parents. Rather than having them unnecessarily worry about us, Guardian can do the hard work and make life easier for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Users sign up on the main website, supplying their name, phone number, and emergency contacts
2) When a user feels the need to have Guardian check-in on them, they can text a time-interval to the Guardian phone number
3) Once that time interval passes, Guardian will send an SMS to the user, checking-in on them
4) If the user does not respond to the text, Guardian will send a personalized SMS to all of the user's emergency contacts
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Web-app was built using Flask. The Twilio API made it easy to automate the sending of SMS messages. Incoming SMS messages are routed to a specific endpoint where our program can handle them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major challenge we faced was handling multiple requests from multiple users on one server. Since our server had to time how long it took a user to reply via SMS, we needed a way for it to work in the background. To solve this, we had to learn about and deploy multi-threading in python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge we faced was designing a clean and intuitive API. We aimed to make our project as hassle-free as possible for the user and tried to limit most interaction to SMS. With neither of us having much front-end experience, translating the UI we drew up on paper into code proved to be very challenging (but rewarding).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prior to this project, both of us had very little HTML, CSS, and Javascript experience, so creating the front-end portion of the project was a very difficult challenge for us. All of the front-end we now know came from creating this project, and we are very satisfied with the result we came up with, and even more satisfied with the newfound knowledge we now have of web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're also very proud of how easy-to-use our application is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, we learned tons of HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as how to integrate an API such as Twilio into the back-end. Furthermore, we discovered many new uses and properties of python and Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Guardian
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step in keeping a family member safe is to have all available information in case something does go wrong. Guardian's next step is to include location services such that the last known time and location of a user who does not respond to their texts can be sent to their emergency contacts. Further, the emergency contacts can choose to release that information to the police if they deem it need be. This way, Guardian can improve its ability to maintain the well-being of its users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And to become a billion-dollar startup :)
