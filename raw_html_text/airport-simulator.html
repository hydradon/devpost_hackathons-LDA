                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our take on the C2 challenge -- we attempted to make a fun, yet somewhat loyal game to how airports work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's basically a throwback to early 2000's flash games. Terrible, derpy graphics. Chaotic and still somewhat fun to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built from scratch on IntelliJ and Vim using Java, we wrote our own engine basing it off one of our members' previous engines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned some Java, that graphics are always hard, and the listeners and global variables are messy.
                </p>
