                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I also realized that there was a big gap in the ability and availability of everyone to be easily able to use websites and technology. This is why PlayAid was created to bridge the gap in technology between those who are underprivileged and impaired. This helps people to easily deal with mental health issues by distracting themselves in fun and easy to use ways.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Facebook graph API and Watson Personality insigth API to analysis a persons personality and produce a graph.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not much aware of how to implement Api's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After several tries and help, we were finally able to implement the Facebook graph API with Personality insigth API.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned quite a lot of new things, like Jquery, node, implementing API's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Know yourself?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing for Know Yourself would be to expand it to include many more features for people with different disabilities, disorders, and impairments (sight, hearing, speaking) so that one day everyone will easily be able to browse the internet without any difficulty, because in this age nobody can live without googling everyday, right?
