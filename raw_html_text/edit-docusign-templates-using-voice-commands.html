                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DocuSign solely relies on the keyboard and mouse for inputs from the user. While this serves the majority of its customers, I am sure people with motor disabilities find it very hard to use(unusable in most cases). This
                    <strong>
                        necessitates a disabled-friendly version of DocuSign built on the existing, robust and powerful DocuSign APIs.
                    </strong>
                    Actions, like editing templates, sending envelopes etc, can be controlled by voice commands.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sample API provided in the file conveys the design and interface. While the sample is not exhaustive and lacks important features, it can be easily extended.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the speech recognition library in PyPi repository. I installed all the dependencies and learned about the library. After this, the integration was pretty straightforward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Installing speech_recognition module was a challenge because of the dependencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple idea that can be integrated with existing APIs to provide support for people with disabilities - it's the idea and the impact that I am really proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about DocuSign, their APIs, and how useful this company is. Also, this was the first time that I played around with voice-to-text. I really enjoyed learning about this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Edit DocuSign templates using voice commands
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire DocuSign API can be abstracted behind a voice-to-text system that correctly triggers the necessary APIs based on the input command.
