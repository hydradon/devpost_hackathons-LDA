                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever since social media has been dominating our lives, we all want to keep on top of every post and tweet. And sometimes that causes us to scroll all the way to yesterday's feed, no matter how long it takes. But what about times when you hadn't had time to check your feed in two, three days, or a week?  Well we have a solution where you don't have to waste your time scrolling!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scroll-No-More is a chrome extension that sorts your feed and allows you to see it by day, up to a week back. Just click on a tab and it'll take you to the day you want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build it we used Chrome Extention API and Twitter REST API. We pull the data from all the tweets on your timeline and embed them into a webpage style chrome extension where if you click on "yesterday" tab it takes you to your feed from yesterday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never before used any API's so we had to learn on the go. Twitter API does not allow to get tweets by date parameter, so we had to figure out a way to get around that using the parameters that do exit, which are count and since_id.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having an interface to show and we have a clear idea of what we want our product to look like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Twitter API is challenging to use, and constraining when it comes to sorting by time.
                </p>

                    What's next for Scroll-No-More
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually want to complete this project and make it work and be efficient in dealing with large and inconsistent amounts of data.
