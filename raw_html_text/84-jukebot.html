                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to find colour in our lives. We wanted to find the true meaning of life. So we created the

                        JukeBot
                    </strong>
                    . It is a completely worthless robot that really helped us to find meaning in our own pathetic lives.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It dances awesomely. It has LEDs and LEDs and wheels and LEDs that pulse to the music. Also, it sings Star Wars songs. This robot is so lit.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using mBot, Arduino, assorted accessories, and a whole lot o' Hack 'n Roll stickers.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Soldering was a bit of a challenge, and finding out how to use the various add-ons for the Arduino was harder than expected. We fixed all of these though, and there are lots of

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating something that dances better than we do. Learning how to use electronics, because we're more software people.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    How to use Arduinos, connect them up, code them, solder things together and take the solder out. Also, we learnt that we need to prepare and evaluate our decisions more.
