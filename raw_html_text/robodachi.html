                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was inspired by a friend of ours who didn't how to prepare for an interview. As we are graduating from college, we believe that our hackathon project could help us and others prepare for interviews.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a chat bot where it helps the user prepare for interviews by asking questions and providing instant feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) provided by Microsoft along with node.js package to determine the logic flow of the conversation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time using node.js, Azure, and LUIS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a working chat bot that is able to ask interview questions and provide feedbacks.  We successfully integrated LUIS with our chat bot which enables us to determine if the user's response.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use LUIS and it's natural language processing platform, how to train the bot using Intents and Entities, as well as how to deploy on Microsoft Azure hosting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Robodachi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're planning to add more interview questions to help users prepare for interviews.  We are planning to integrate technical questions within our bot since our questions are currently focused on general interviews. We want to expand the dataset for LUIS to provide a more accurate feedback.
