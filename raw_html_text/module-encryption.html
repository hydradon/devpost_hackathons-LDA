                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How do you do Cryptography without keys? How can you avoid the problems of someone stealing your keys?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A new method of cryptography that can be both open source and secure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a lot of time, effort, headaches, and coffee. Also, through extensive consulting of the unicode website because ASCII characters are absolutely insane to deal with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is very hard to change a String that is already in octal configuration to a hexadecimal configuration, and then back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of it - the entire idea is unique. I also put a lot more time and thought into this to make it function quickly as well as efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Encryption is hard. Very. Very. Hard. I do not exaggerate this at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Module Encryption
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More and more modules. Also, I would hope that this technology could advance sufficiently that it may be used without worry of any brute force assaults.
