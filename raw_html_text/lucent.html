                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A passion for music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reads EEG data (brain waves) and uses a from-scratch implementation of machine learning in tandem with the Spotify API to help identify music that can help you focus on work, get pumped up at the gym, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very little sleep, a fair amount of coffee, a lot of programming, and ripping open a cheap EEG-based toy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing machine learning with no prior experience was something else. The wires we used initially were to small and ended up breaking. Had to do an emergency repair by borrowing some wires from another project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to combine a tough hardware hack with an interesting programming challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never use cheap wires.
                </p>

                    What's next for Lucent
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully some refinement on the machine learning.
                </p>
