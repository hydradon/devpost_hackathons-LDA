                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I fell in love with scuba diving on my very first dive in Phuket, Thailand over a decade ago. Since that dive, I have obtained my PADI open water diver certification, and continued my love of diving in Cozumel, Hawaii, Dominican Republic, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through scuba diving, I've become aware of the problems facing the oceans that cover 71% of our earth's surface. Additionally, 400 different species of marine life have ingested or become entangled in marine debris, and 70% of marine litter end up on the bottom of our oceans.
This project is in support of the non-profit, Project Aware, and specifically their Dive Against Debris campaign. The Dive Against Debris initiative is the "Adopt-a-Highway" program for the ocean where divers pick up and catalog marine debris (aka trash). Divers through the Dive Against Debris program have already removed and cataloged over 1 million pieces of marine debris in the ocean to date.

User instruction: "Tap the spool of fishing line to help clean up #DiveAgainstDebris" Once the user finds and taps the spool, it disappears. 
Next user instruction: "Tap the glass bottle to help clean up #DiveAgainstDebris" Once the user finds and taps the bottle, it disappears. 
The user is rewarded with a clean ocean view and the message: "Great job! Thanks for doing your part for #DiveAgainstDebris"

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drawing from my scuba diving experiences, I started searching the AR library for 3d objects of marine life and scuba diving equipment. I found "dancing crabs," coral, and goggles. 
I started with the
                    <a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/documentation/sample-effects" rel="nofollow">
                        Visual Shaders Sample Effect
                    </a>
                    to learn how to incorporate 3D objects with a face tracker. Next, I  completed the
                    <a href="https://www.developercircleresources.com/learningPath/challenges/5f8a19ed-4fd6-420d-b74e-3f1163e87364" rel="nofollow">
                        Learning Path Challenges
                    </a>
                    in the Developer Circle Resources. 
On August 10th, 2019, I co-led the Spark AR workshop at the Atlanta Community Build Day -
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thecarolinedunn/media_set?set=a.2990453737693662&amp;type=3" rel="nofollow">
                        photos here
                    </a>
                    . Using my learning from the Spark AR demos and tutorials, I started searching for the 3D objects I needed for my project. I searched the AR library for scuba goggles, a wet suit, a scuba breathing equipment, coral, a glass bottle, marine creatures (crabs and fish), fishing spool, and more. Next, I searched and found 2D royalty-free images for my ocean background, fish, and other objects I needed for my effect. I resized and placed the background images for the front camera and the back cameras. Next, I added a face tracker and placed my 3D objects for the front camera. For the back camera, I placed coral, the ocean debris, and dancing crabs. I used particle systems to simulate swimming fish and bubbles rising, just as I've seen in my own scuba diving experience.
                    <br>
                    I created a "gamification" aspect of the effect by instructing the user to look for specific pieces of ocean debris (first the spool of fishing line), and have the user "pick-up" trash by having them tap on the object. I utilized "touch object" logic to simulate the "trash pick-up" portion of my effect. i.e. when the user touches the glass bottle, the glass bottle disappears and the user receives a message stating that they have picked up the bottle. I realized that I provided visual instructions to help the user navigate the challenge of the effect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a fully immersive scuba diving experience which required combining a background with 3D objects on a face tracker. I positioned the objects on the face tracker, but when I added the background, the 3D objects disappeared behind the background. I had to move the 3D objects forward (Z axis) in order for them to be visible in front of the background. 
Additionally, I didn't have the resources to create 3D objects that didn't already exist in the library. I couldn't find the scuba diving regulator that a diver uses to breath underwater. I had to get creative and combine a tube and a stopper for the breathing apparatus.

                    Since August 2019, I now have 4 Facebook effects, and 3 Instagram filters approved.  My Hearts Instagram filter received over 60,000 impressions in the first week thanks to a couple of my influencer friends sharing my filter.

                    When I embarked on this journey, I honestly didn't even know how to access Facebook effects, much less make one. I learned the power of augmented reality and Facebook's investment in AR. I learned SparkAR, the approval process, and the technical and space requirements to create and submit an effect.

                    Through my project, I hope to help decrease new ocean trash through awareness of the economic and environmental impacts. I hope that the typical beach goer, or cruise ship passenger will now think twice before tossing trash into the ocean. 
I would love to increase the gamification aspect and add more marine life.
