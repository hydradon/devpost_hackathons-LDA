                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looking at the Syrian refgees arriving in Germany we realized that the refugees, after suffering so much trauma, are being very skeptical about placing trust in local residents. This causes the interaction between the residents and immigrants (possibly future residents) to cease to bare minimum. This creates sub cultures within the cities that don't interact with each other which is bad for the cultural evolution of society and causes integration issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an app that enables the immigrants and locals to interact with each other by the means of user curated requests made by immigrants to which the locals respond by setting up events to help out the immigrants for requests that are common to multiple immigrants (curated by upvotes).
                </p>
