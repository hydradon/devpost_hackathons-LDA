                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have pretty strict parents, and as a result, we know that many would be interested in this web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The api allows you to locate your car, and our code amplifies that by not only providing location, but speed as well (through odometer and time).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the SmartCar API and then coded the web app in python using flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble implementing the SmartCar api and deploying the web app. Additionally, it was difficult to reach into the variables from the API.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                </p>

                    What's next for Magni-find
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make an android and IOS app, and add features to it such as: real-time speed of vehicle, GoogleMaps or Snapchat API to track location in real-time, track parking spot, a notification center, and have an appealing UI.
