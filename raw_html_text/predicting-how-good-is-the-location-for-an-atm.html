                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Faced problems a lot of times finding ATM where needed and had to move around a lot to withdraw some cash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always wanted banks to think before setting up an ATM and not set up just another ATM with a host of other ATMs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ATMs are usually concentrated at a particular location and not spread out well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Predicts if bank should setup an ATM at a location or should not; based on ATMs in and around that area and that area's population density
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using node.js, query, express.js, CapitalOne API, ESRI API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nessie which is CapitalOne's API does not return all ATM locations but just 10 at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using Node.js but we worked hard on it and achieved the desired result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't believe it would be possible to build a good app in 24 hours straight but after coming here and struggling for the same I could do it and learned a lot. Learned how to work on node js and how to integrate maps along with it and perform the desired actions on map.
                </p>
