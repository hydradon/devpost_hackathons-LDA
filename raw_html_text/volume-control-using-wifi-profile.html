                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever played a video during lecture without muting your laptop volume? 
With this program, you can be sure to not embarrass yourself in class during these moments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compare the current SSID with the settings and set the volume to the preconfigured level
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the program with Python, interacting with the system command line to adjust the volume
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Platform compatibility(currently only works on Mac OS X), unable to accommodate multiple WiFi profiles,
most importantly: unable to run automatically when WiFi is connected
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python GUI with Tkinter

                    What's next for Volume control using wifi profile
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiple entries with database, volume control depending on background noise level, run automatically when WiFi is connected
                </p>
