                        Confluence Source Editor
                    </a>
                    , we thought it would be fun to take a popular server plugin and see if we could port it to the cloud.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lets you edit Confluence page XHMTL directly, with beatification, change preview, find/replace, code folding and more!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Confluence Source Editor front-end code as a starting point, salvaging what we could, and rewriting anything that was not Cloud compatible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ended up rewriting a significant portion of the code, due to most of it not fitting the cloud architecture. It was also hard to find out how to integrate the editor into the interface, given that you don't have the flexibility you do during server plugin development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The plugin is completely client-side, so we don't receive or store any user data.
                </p>
