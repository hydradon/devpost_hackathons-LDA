                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the untapped power of the human mind and the countless opportunities ahead -- connecting our minds to the digital world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Big Picture: We take signals from a brain and process them through an EEG made from scratch with op-amps  (containing 7 stages filters to remove noise and amplify the signals). The data collected by the EEG will then be processed again by the sparkcore. The data gathered by the serial port is continuously sent to a web server through wifi. Only then we used the data to control the devices' states (on and off) in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Electrodes were not sensitive enough (just need better quality electrodes)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built every component of the project from scratch. From the instrumentation amplifier for the EEG to the web server.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure to wire properly the batteries feeding the op amps to prevent electric shocks to the brave guinea pig hooked to the electrodes (Still safe though).

                <h2>
                    What's next for Smart Power Strip wirelessly controlled by an EEG
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add high quality electrodes and control home automation systems only using the brain. Control music songs wirelessly depending on the state of the mind (easy to track focused, relaxed stated, excitement etc...).
