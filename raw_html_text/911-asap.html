                    Inspiration We wanted to build an app that can help people going through severe medical issues and can make their 911 call streamlined and efficient.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does It stores a patients medical data and when going through a crisis, they would press the 911 button , which saves them hastle of dialing 911, and all the medical data would be sent to the 911 medical centre and to the next of kin.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it We decided to build a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) of the idea and have a basic web app and a back end that would talk to a firebase database to fetch and retrieve data and send the data to a Twilio api that would make phone calls to the 911 call centre as well as send messages to the next of kin.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into We had a lot of difficulty learning new frameworks that we found difficult, let alone build something with it . Due to time constraints , we had to build a basic web app and had to learn node js and firebase as well the twillio api.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of We never expected ourselves to build an app that can send messages to phones in real time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned node js firebase and leanring through googling and on the spot.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 911 ASAP implement more features such as contacting security services, veterinian healthcare, and other such situations that would people's live on the edge.
