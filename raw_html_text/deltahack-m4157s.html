                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millions of people around the globe are affected by Sleep Apnea. Currently, diagnosis is only possible at sleep clinics. This can be uncomfortable for many patients. We hope to eliminate the need of spending whole nights at sleep clinics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This android mobile application, analyzes audio files of patients breath sounds and detects how many Apnea episodes occurred over the night. The app includes a calendar view which displays how many Apnea episode the patient had since using the app.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android studio, Kotlin, and Python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzing an audio file was very challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By the end of the Hack we were able to create an android app which successfully displays the number of Apnea episode occurred in a breath audio file. This information is received through a rest API from the Python file which analyzes the data and identifies Apnea occurrences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to down sample and process audio signals. We also learned how to create a multi page android application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DeltaHack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps would include enabling direct connection between the microphone and mobile app. Currently, the application analyzes pre-recorded audio files. Also, we would like to capture body movements throughout the recording to better understand patient's level of restfulness.
