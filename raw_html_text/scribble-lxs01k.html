                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were in high school we used to play this simple game on a piece of paper. What a better place than a hackathon to turn it into a multiplier online game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have developed a Node.js server which takes care of the user pairing and game logic using Phaser. On the client side, we have built a simple HTML and CSS website which also employs Pusher to communicate with the server and the other client inside the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have had some problems with the front-end, since we didn't have previous experience with mobile web app technologies. Also, in the last two hours of hackathon we've shared the game url for people to test it. We have noticed some issues regarding communications between clients which we are trying to fix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have wanted to develop this game for a long time, and we are very proud of having been able to started and completed it in just 24h and using technologies that were new to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have improved our web and Node.js skills. Plus discovered a very interesting framework: Pusher.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Scribble
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add a profile for each unique user where other players can see the sketches created and interpreted.
