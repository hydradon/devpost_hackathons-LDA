                <p>
                    This application provides a free platform for us to check whether we have malignant or benign skin cancer . How it works is you can upload a photo of your skin that might be malignant or benign; or anything that appears on your skin and it concerns you. In this application, we also can chat with a doctor to check the result of the image.
                </p>
