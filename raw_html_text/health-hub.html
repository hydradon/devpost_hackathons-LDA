                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Health Hub is inspired by the struggles that many people face every day when dealing with health issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two members of our team both struggle with adjusting our diets to account for acid reflux. We wanted to create a way for users to be able to find out what triggers symptoms of their health issues (acid reflux, allergies, etc)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website allows users to input their daily food intake, view past meals and log when their symptoms occur. Health Hub hopes to allows users to take control of their health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first designed wire frames using balsamic and converted most of those wireframes into functional website. We wanted to use python for back end development however we were not able to implement the python flask framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of our project we hoped to create an Android application in order to account for our target users (adults over 40) preferred method of communication based on our research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were unable to use Android due to the limited skill sets within our team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we created a website that is easy for our target users to interact with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about website creation as well as HTML and CSS specifics.
                </p>

                    What's next for Health Hub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    implementing python framework and creation of android app.
