                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use the Clarifai api because it's godlike, and this is what we thought of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can upload an image to the website (drag and drop and such) and it will return corresponding emojis, as well as hashtags
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend is built using web technologies, and the backend is made using Flask and Python. We deployed the front end on Github pages, and the backend on Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend team had many issues with css positioning and design. The backend team had problems with passing a base64 encoded string with an http request, as well as uploading the string to Clarifai.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ended up accomplishing our original goal, and even if it's not the craziest project in the world, we are are happy to have made something. I am happy with how much we all grew as developers, and the experience that we gained.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for image-to-emoji
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More accurate results. I also want to make a twitter bot that uses the deployed API to tweet out photos along with emojis, and hashtags.
