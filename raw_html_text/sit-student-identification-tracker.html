                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On my way home from school my bus went to one of the stops to drop off a student. In order to get to the stop we have to go through a neighborhood for five minutes and it takes five minutes to leave. As we arrived at the stop the student wasn't even on the bus and therefore we wasted 10 minutes just trying to drop off a student who wasn't even their. after that Ic are up with the idea and expanded on it to make it what it is today

Design:
Welcome to SIT. The interactive application that allows the educational system to become more reliable and organized, such as bus management. This is a lucrative market as a great majority of the schooling system are insufficient in terms of maintenance, which in turn impacts the community in general . With this innovative idea, we plan on incorporating proximity sensors and BLE within the user&rsquo;s identification device so the bus may automatically recognize that the user has entered. These sensors will be connected to our app, so that the user can determine whether they will be attending the bus or not. Not only does this idea benefit the bus and educational industry, but it entitles opportunities for many more emerging industries as well. One other example of how beneficial the incorporation of proximity sensors is in the user&rsquo;s identification device is to assure attendance within the classroom. Often, taking attendance within the classroom can be very hectic, especially with bigger classes. The solution to this problem is to eliminate the root of the problem, which is the attendance program. Instead, if users use the identification device provided to them, we can automatically mark the student present the moment they walk into the classroom. Each classroom will have a Bluetooth device, such as a Mac or an iPad, that will recognize the sensor. We can connect the attendance with the teacher or professor through our app, so they can double check to ensure there are no faults. This will fix multiple problems the education system has, such as skipping class. It will also teach scholars to be more responsible and disciplined, as they must carry their identification at all times. However, if the scholar should forget their identification device, they can always check into the classroom through the application included within the program on their personal device. 
The identification device itself will be powered by a BLE device. A BLE, or Bluetooth Low Energy, is a small powerful chip that allows a shorter amount of data to be sent, such as sensor data, using a low amount of power consumption. The benefit of a BLE over a traditional Bluetooth chip is that the BLE is cheaper and smaller, so it will be more beneficial towards this cause. Not only that, but due to it&rsquo;s low power consumption, the chip will last well over a year, which already surpasses its original need. The chip itself will be powered by a 20mm Coin Cell Battery. This battery will give more than enough power to the chip, and is relatively cheaper than the alternate options.

                    Due to the fact that Im not a skilled programmer, I used a software called app demo store which allows me to make and simulate an app on my phone for my idea. With this if I wan't to make it real I am able to take the code forms eh software and put it into a real app.

                    I originally was gonna use flinto to make the app but ran into some challenges with the software. Then while working a friend of mine pointed out the lack of technology for this idea. But thankfully after some research we found technology which exists to make this idea come true.

                    We hope to take this idea to a developer, get some advice, some opinions from school districts, and hopefully make this idea come to life.
