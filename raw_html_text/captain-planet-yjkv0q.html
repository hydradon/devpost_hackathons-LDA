                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When there are very strong winds in Singapore during a storm, potted plants in HDB corridor ledges and balcony ledges rock and fall over. The result is a mess of broken ceramics and scattered soil all over the corridor or balcony.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Captain Planet detects when strong winds rocks the pot and brings the plant down to floor level, thus preventing the case where the plant and soil falls all over the floor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Arduino's gyro with accelerometer sensor module, we built a sensor onto the potted plant that detects when the pot tilts when the wind blows against it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Arduino then sends a command to a Micro Servo motor to rotate a pinion on a rack to lower the pot to the floor level using a scissors lift.
