                    Why did we do this:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. This is why we chose to focus on this crucial part of our lives. By creating this product we strive to better the state of wellbeing of our users. 
It has been generally accepted that listening to music can have various positive effects on your mental health. We have found that the correlation between music and your mood can change your everyday life. Now we are going to present the tools used.

                    Why we chose Emotions API:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Emotion API beta takes an image as an input and returns the confidence across a set of emotions for each face in the image, as well as a bounding box for the face from the Face API. The emotions detected are happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, contempt, disgust, or neutral. These emotions are communicated cross-culturally and universally via the same basic facial expressions, where are identified by Emotion API. So instead of the person searching for what music to listen to, an app could give a recommendation based on the user&rsquo;s facial expression.

                <h2>
                    Why we chose Spotify API:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As one of the most popular music streaming platforms in the world, Spotify has the most high-quality playlists of any API we tried. We utilized the database behind one of the largest music streaming apps in the world. On top of the regular artist /album / track data search functionalities, Spotify&rsquo;s API offers access to public playlists. According to a recent Wired article, Spotify&rsquo;s playlists are a uniquely influential tool. Its Today&rsquo;s Top Hits playlist has 14.4 million followers alone!
Why we chose imdb movies:
We chose lists that were picked by a person and voted up. By doing this we insure that the majority of people would find what is in the watchlists true.

                <h2>
                    How we determined what playlist to play depending on emotion:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Listening to music can create peak emotions, which increase the amount of dopamine, a specific neurotransmitter that is produced in the brain and helps control the brain&rsquo;s reward and pleasure centers. To determine the genre to emotion function we generally used logic or articles. However, we have also made a survey to reach a general consensus on what to implement in our product. That is how we chose to play an anger playlist when the person is angry. The reasoning behind that is that the average person would prefer to get the anger out of their system. That is also why we recommend a &ldquo;Diss tracks&rdquo; playlist when the person is feeling disgust.
