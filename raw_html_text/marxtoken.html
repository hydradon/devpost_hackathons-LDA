                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a currency that had inherit properties that combated income inequality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Marx token can only be transferred in increments of 1 to accounts with a balance of 0 Marx tokens. This guarantees no one can ever hold more than 1 Marx token at anytime except for the creator of the Token. Because of there restrictions on the Marx token, an economy based on the Marx token would never experience income inequality because wealth is equal, fixed, and not easily redistributed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the Marx Token on the Ropsten Test Network using the Solidity Remix online compiler and MetaMask to interface with the Ethereum network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The WiFi in the arena was unusable and had trouble finding test ether to validate the contracts and deploy my token.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I got to bring this idea to life and that I was able to find good resources that gave me a better understanding of how Ethereum works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about how Cryptocurrencies work and more specifically how gas lights and limits make Ether unique. I also familiarized myself with Ethereum development tools, test networks, and compilers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MarxToken
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to eventually deploy Marx on the Ethereum Main Network and perhaps add new mechanics to the currency more usable while preserving the properties that fight income inequality.
