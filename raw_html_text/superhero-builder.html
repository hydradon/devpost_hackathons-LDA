                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My kids love playing super hero, so I wanted to give them the ability to create one through Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build a hero of your name with your own outfit colors.  They select from the valid ability options and face them off against opponents in a race.  The opponents each have a weakness that is listed before race and it is up to the kid to pick the right ability to take advantage of that weakness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using python with flask ask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing enough different story lines to keep the game feeling unique on each different run through
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The variability in the hero race keeps it engaging on multiple run through's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges with kids responding to questions and how to pick up what they said.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Superhero Builder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to do a two player version where each kid picks then own hero and then has them race each other to see who made the fastest one.
                </p>
