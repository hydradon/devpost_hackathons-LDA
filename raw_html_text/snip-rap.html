                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration arose in our general penchant towards music. While none of us have become particularly averse in the field, we have each dabbled in it at the very least, having experienced both the highs and lows, the thrills and disappointments, and close-technicality and cuoriosities that tie together the Creative Arts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows for exchange of musical verses/rap lines between people. Thus, people would record a short segment (limited to 10 seconds) of rap material, which we would be able to overlay over a set of background music choices. Then, the two would exchange back and forth, repeating the process as they so desire (and this could happen with many such friends simultaneously, though a given exchange will only ever involve two people). At any later time, the stream can be "ended" when either of the two people presses the "compile" button and saves the entire stream into a .wav file. The users can choose to either keep or delete the results and can revel in the arts of their works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, this feature would integrate with a feed page, where a person would be able to showcase his/her "top chains" (a chain being a sequence of tied musical shorts), which is ranked based on popularity and given rankings of the people in the community.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the app using Android (which combines both Java and XML in its development envrironments)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a result of our lack of experience, we encountered many challenges in the debugging process. In particular, the more esoteric bugs and those related to I/O were the most challenging and frustrating to deal with. Further, none of us had experience with front-end development, which made it quite difficult to effectively deliver on the UI end and too satisfy being academically-motivated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While it is not yet a complete development in certain aspects, I am very proud of having been able to download the parts of an app fully developed in Android, having had literally 0 exposure to the technology to it previously.
