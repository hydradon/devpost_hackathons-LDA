                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was shopping with my friend and she couldn't find Queso at Wegmans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You text to a number for information!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this application with the Twilio and Wegmans API in python and the flask framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SMS characters have a character limit.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I wanted to narrow the search down the store but it made too many API calls and stalled the application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I didn't have time to figure out how to include a Wegmans pdf map to my messages.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud of creating something I'd actually use.
## What I learned
I was somewhat familiar with API calls so I learned how to integrate the response component of Twilio's API.
