                    This product is a web application that allows a user to track the amount of time spent doing different activities each week.  The user inputs the activity done by the hour, and can view graphs of their time management over a week, month, or year.  There are plans to convert this into a mobile application, as well as increase functionality by allowing the user to plan ahead and determine how well they are at following a schedule.
