                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our modern day, we have multiple ways of communicating with others. However, the fact remains that there can be reception and network problems caused by unforeseen scenarios, such as state emergencies, war, and natural disasters. All of these scenarios can pose great stress on current cell towers and can disrupt our means of communications.
