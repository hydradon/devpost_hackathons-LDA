                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to listen to music with my friend but they are halfway across the world.  I wanted to share listening so we could enjoy the music at the same time as well.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It basically is an interface where you would listen to music with a player that would update on two different ends.
