                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've witnessed on multiple occasions that the women in our lives have a tough time with faulty tampon/pad machines. Instead of them having to run to the store, they can use TampBud as a means of quick and easy access to these products.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives women easy access to hygienic needs and emergencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the FERN stack (React, Firebase, Express and Node) to build this web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deploying the actual web app and picking the correct tech stack were two of the biggest challenges we ran into.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get a working demo up and out of the door in less than 12 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that reviewing boilerplate ahead of time is crucial. Additionally, a proper sleeping schedule is a must.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TampBud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can further develop TampBud to be an actual product rather than just an idea to help make the lives of women easier.
                </p>
