                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a freshman, a college campus can be a difficult place to navigate. Finding a bathroom should be as easy as finding a classroom, but our campus maps lack locations of bathrooms for everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>

                    Are
                    <strong>
                        you
                    </strong>
                    a human with physiological needs including air and sanitation? With a quick load of the webpage, you can see the location of bathrooms around the UCSC campus! Our site also allows you to select what kind of bathrooms you wish to find with special filters which refine search results to reflect your desired bathroom specifications.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google Map API we located bathrooms on campus. Our website features a drop down menu to filter out different bathroom types. We also used Amazon Web Services to host our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered problems with redirection to the desired domain name, locked building doors, and lacking knowledge about our own campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collectively we are proud to have gained more campus awareness by finding more all-gender restroom locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about project management and focusing on the core of a project to later add details. We learned how accessible and easy to use the Google Maps API was.
                </p>

                    What's next for Bathroom Buddies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to further the filter selection variety by adding options of changing station locations and showers. We also would like to provide users with the possibility of different language translation in order to increase accessibility to all users.
