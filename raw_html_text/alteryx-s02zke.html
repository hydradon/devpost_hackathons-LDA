                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw the challenge and we were interested in competing and learning about data analysis
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It solves a problem to find the attendance of a certain event
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I played around with the software framework learning how to manipulate strings and combine data fields or manipulate them. Most of this project included

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use the new software, this includes adopting a new way of thinking for this software, which makes some problems hard and other problems easier. It is defined for use because there is a market for data manipulation and it can accomplish these.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to move items from rows into different columns by separating them and then recombining them. The other hard part was recognizing the winter olympics on the map, as I have never payed attention to these events in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use a power data analysis software, and my first data analysis project, I learned a lot about working with numbers and manipulating to fit my needs, or playing with them until I find a result that fits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We calculated that there are about 826,822 people attending this years
