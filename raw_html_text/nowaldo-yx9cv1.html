                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a Where's Waldo game that would track the user's time to find Waldo. We would provide hints where we black out half of the image where Waldo wasn't, in turn the user would be penalized with seconds added to their final score. We also wanted to implement a leaderboard.
                </p>

                    File uploading would force us to close images before opening new ones. We wanted to implement a scrollbar due to the size of the images but it wouldn't properly scroll, it would only return to its intial position.

                    We initially wanted to complete this in OpenCV, however multiple people had problems installing it onto their laptops. We opted for Pillow instead but it created even more problems as we had issues with the file upload. If we had more time we would go back and try it with OpenCV
