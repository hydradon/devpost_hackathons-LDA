                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At a previous Hackathon, one of our fellow hackers was visually impaired. Throughout the event, he consistently had trouble getting around and expressed to us his fear of running into his surroundings. We believe if we were able to create a wearable sensor to warn him of his surroundings this would help him eliminate much of his stress and make it easier to navigate between places. Also, our group bought a 12pc bucket on the bus ride here and wanted to incorporate it in our hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kentucky Front Camera beeps at different pitches to identify the distance of the object. The closer a detected object is, the higher pitch the beep is and vice versa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Arduino Uno for the entirety of this project along with a piezo speaker, an ultrasonic sensor, a PIR motion sensor and a battery bank for additional power. In addition, a KFC bucket was used for better display of the sensor, and a chest strap on was used in order for the sensor to be worn for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major challenges we faced was using the Arduino motion sensor. It was difficult for us to determine the exact sensitivity we needed the sensor to be in as we were unsure how the motion sensor would pick up motion. In addition, we ran into the problem with using the speakers because of the difficult wiring procedures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of being able to combine the motion sensor, ultrasonic sensor all together into controlled by one program as well as displayed on to creative design to be worn by the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kentucky Front Camera
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our next step, we would like to add sensors on the side to provide a 180-degree view of the surroundings and possibly to detect objects closer to the ground(stairs, rocks). In addition, we have in mind to utilize more speakers using human voices to make the Kentucky Front Camera more desirable for the user. It would also be better if the entire project was fitted into a smaller frame, which could allow people to easily clip on a small camera to their shirt.
