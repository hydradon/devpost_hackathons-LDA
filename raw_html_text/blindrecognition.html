                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Visually-impaired visuals may have trouble gauging what's immediately in front of them, or what they're holding specifically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By creating software that accesses your web-cam, takes a picture, and says what you're holding. This could help determine objects pass someone just trying to feel for texture or shape. Also, some objects may be dangerous to hold.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was eventually built in a stand-alone java application, using the many resources provided by AWS to streamline the whole process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally wanted to use Amazon-Alexa, but the wait time to upload a skill was too long to complete the project by the deadline. Originally, we wanted to use Android as well, but paring different devices, and trying to learn new languages, became a challenge to handle.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is everyone's first hackathon, with the exception of one person, who has only been to one other hackathon. For most of us, the act of actually finishing a product in a short time for most of our first times is something we're proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BlindRecognition
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Phone functionality and Alexa functionality would make this app much more useful for individuals, allowing them to have mobile on-the-move recognition. The combination of that, with a myo armband, would be great for pure gesture activation.
