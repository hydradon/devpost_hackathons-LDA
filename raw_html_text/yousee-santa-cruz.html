                    In every city and town, there are places you'll often never hear about on the internet--places that the locals know like it's on the back of their hands.
Usually, it stays like that because these places only spread via word-of-mouth. But not everyone wants these amazing places to remain a secret, especially when the only reason it's a secret is because it's not well publicized.
We wanted to provide an easy way for locals to pin point all their favorite, relatively unknown places so they can share them with the world.
