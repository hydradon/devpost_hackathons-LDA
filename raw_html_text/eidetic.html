                    Inspiration- Since tech has become so prevalent, the ability to take pictures and upload to social media, you lose the value in living in the moment. After watching Boys Meets World's Time Capsule episode, we realized that we can create an application that emulates the "time capsule experience". With Eidetic, you will not lose the value of the photos.

                <h2>
                    What it does- Set a date where you will lock the photos. You won&rsquo;t be able to access the photo until the set date arrives
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it- We used a drag-and-drop application called Thunkable.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into- Storing photos for a certain amount of time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of- Being able to access the camera, camera roll, have an existing log-in page, organizing the icons in a certain order.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eidetic- Implementing other log-in tools (social media), having a working timer/date setter, and having a large enough database to store multiple photos
