                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We were inspired by the growing controversy surrounding climate change and the stereotypes surrounding global warming. We wanted to spread awareness regarding our effect of the planet which impacts many generations in the future.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  Our calculator calculates the carbon footprint of a car trip. It takes two locations and calculates the distance between them. We then calculate the carbon emissions by dividing by the average miles per gallon and multiplying it by the grams of carbon released per gallon.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  We used javascript, google-api, html and css to code our website. Our website used the google-api for our pop up image of google maps. We used the javascript to code the algorithm for carbon footprint. Finally, we used the CSS to style our website.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  Since we had a time constraint, we weren't able to completely finish calculating the amount of miles for each location. We also ran into challenges getting the google API coded but, managed to fix it. We had several small bugs in the code that we weren't able to debug at first, but perservered and managed to fix it in the end.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  Our team was relatively new to coding, so we are really proud of our website. We learned how to incorporate Javascript and Google Maps APIs into our website which none of us had done before. It was an eye opening day filled with high-fives and cheers whenever we accomplished something, even if it was as small as making our button do what it was supposed to.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We learned how to code using google API and java script. We definitely learned a lot more coding through our website!

                <h2>
                    What's next for Carbon Footprint
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  In the future, my team plans to calculate the carbon footprint traveled between two places, not only for cars, but also for walking and biking. This way we can really show how going green really helps the environment or how we are harming nature around us.
