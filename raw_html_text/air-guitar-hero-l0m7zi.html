                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an api to convert motion control into keyboard input, which can be used to control games
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaCV, and OpenCV to perform vision processing on a webcam's input. It searches the image for hands, and does keyboard input based on hand position
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It turns out that actually simulating key input can be very messy, and the timing can be unpredictable
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be honest we came in here expecting nothing to work. The project ended up being more reliable than we expected
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Air Guitar Hero
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we said, you can play more than just guitar hero with this. Hopefully in the future, we can expand this to more games
                </p>
