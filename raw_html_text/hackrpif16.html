                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People can never seem to decide where to go, without a Pen and paper, because of dietary restrictions like Pineapples or Apples, distance, or simply just don't want to eat a certain type of food. Our idea is to simplify choosing a place to eat by use of a voting system, where one can sort based without a Pen.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user joins or creates a group with other people.
User gets a list of nearby restaurants based on geolocation, and can choose a top 3 to vote via the Borda voting system. The person who created the group can stop the vote and parse the data, returning the most popular restaurant nearby.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A flask backend with an android frontend were the essentials of this project. 
MySQL was used as the database to store register/login/groups.
TripAdvisor api was used to get nearby restaurant data.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we faced was the communication of the frontend and backend. MySQL with normalization was something we had to learn while doing this project.
