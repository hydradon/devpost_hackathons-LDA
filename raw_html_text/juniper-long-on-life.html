                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was inspired by a desire to revolutionize the insurance model by utilizing blockchain to automate processes, remove expensive intermediary overhead, and distribute insurance risk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a web application as an extension to Juniper to  automate the creation of an approved policy and record the details on an easily auditable blockchain; to transfer the risk asset to reinsurers; and to allow beneficiaries of insurers to submit claims which will automatically begin the verification process and payout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it on the ethereum ropsten testnet using javascript, solidity and ethers.io. Wireframes were built on sigma and then front-end was coded with html and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were struggling to understand the current insurance model and all the problems that accompany it, and how we can improve the process and disrupt the industry by implementing blockchain technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After much debate, everyone in the team finally come up with a MVP that works and shows how blockchain can be used to solve some of the problems with the current insurance system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The importance of drilling down and clearly identifying the problem in order to design a solution that met stakeholder expectations. We gained deeper understanding of the insurance industry, regulations, and roles of different parties from a systemic perspective.
                </p>

                    What's next for Juniper Long On Life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue to explore other problems in the insurance model that can be solved by blockchain but we don't have time to put together in a hackathon
