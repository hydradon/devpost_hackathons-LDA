                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Android app utilizes the built-in orientation sensor and accelerometer to analyze the user&rsquo;s motions and convert them into the music of one of two air instruments: guitar or violin. Based on the gestures made in the air with the phone, the notes of the instrument are played.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and two Android phones for testing to create this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once we retrieved data from the phone&rsquo;s sensors, one of the biggest challenges we faced was interpreting the data in a meaningful way that translated to movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discovered and explored the different motion and position sensors that Android phones possess.
After sufficient experimentation, we were able to determine which sensors were best used for our purposes.
                </p>

                    What's next for Airochord
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can improve on accuracy and precision of movements. We also can add a larger variety of instruments that can be played such as the piano. Also, we can improve the user interface.
