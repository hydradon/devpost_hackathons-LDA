                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A scene from Meet the Robinsons movie where the villain controls a flying hat, and lands the hat on a frog to possess it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two stepper motors move a magnet in the XY direction over a field of magnetic switches. The game is started when the red button is pressed, and the player will have 30 seconds to move through the field without touching any magnets. The game ends when either a magnetic switch is triggered or when time is up.
