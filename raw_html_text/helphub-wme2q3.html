                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project connects people who need help with people who are willing to give it. In the future, virtual and augmented reality will be readily available to everyone, allowing for a big platform to provide quick and useful data. This project shows the application of this technology in the future by providing mass data that can prevent catastrophes, whether that be a failing grade or a loss of life, by projecting solutions in front of people's eyes and making the resources around them more accessible. This promotes safety in the community, improves opportunity, and fosters collaboration between all people.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project connects people in need with those who can help. It also pulls a as well as a variety of data from APIs and presents useful information to users in virtual reality. Some examples include mapping out an optimal and safe route using traffic accident and parking data and providing the fastest route to receive medical help during an emergency. This can be useful in the near future when everyone will have easy access to virtual and augmented reality technology. The idea is that mass amounts of information and user data can be stored in one place, presented visually and quickly in front of a user's eyes, and help the user immediately and most efficiently in time of need.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity, C#, GearVR, and data from a variety of APIs.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty with implementing virtual reality.

                    What's next for HelpHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to mine greater amounts of data and user input. The vision is that HelpHub would become Google 2.0 and become the #1 source for quick information and help.
