                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this web app due to the rampant cheating present in our high school. We feel that something has to be done about it, and this is our proposed solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our web app, you can upload a test and download multiple shuffled versions, or you can save these versions for each class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began by creating a test class in python, which would hold information about an inputted test. Then, we wrote methods to shuffle this test and output a docx file with these shuffled copies. Finally, we implemented this web app in front end by using flask along with html and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being only two members, we managed to overcome many obstacles. We originally planned to store shuffled tests in mongoDB, but unfortunately, this plan didn't work out. We compromised by storing these tests in a local folder. Additionally, we had trouble passing files from front end to back end, but were able to figure it out eventually.

                    Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our first time using flask, we are proud of what we were able to accomplish. We figured out variable passing into HTML, as well as file and list passing.

                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about flask and how to use it to connect python scripts to html and css.

                    A working database that stores information and can be retrieved, a login page.
