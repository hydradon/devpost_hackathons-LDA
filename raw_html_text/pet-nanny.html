                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meet Jack. 
Jack works at an office 9 hours a day; he commutes for 2 hours every day, and his cat waiting for him at home&hellip; it&rsquo;s not cool!

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Randomly generate some activity during day-time hours, that will have your cat or dog try to catch a moving object. The moving object is hanging at the end of a bouncing material controlled by a servo.
