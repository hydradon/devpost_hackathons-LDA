                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other text-based games such as Colossal Cave Adventure and Zork.

                <p>
                    "Them" puts you in the shoes of a crewmember of a spaceship who has just returned with one crewmate to find their spaceship has been badly damaged and the other members of their crew are missing.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we coded the text-based adventure using Python and then transferred it to Twilio with modifications so that it could be conducted via text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are not computer scientists, so we came in knowing little to no programming languages. It was difficult to translate the Python code to Twilio.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a game that works and learned on the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to programme.
