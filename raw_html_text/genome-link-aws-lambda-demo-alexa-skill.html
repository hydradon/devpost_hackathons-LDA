                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I started looking at things to do, I was happy to see there was support for what&rsquo;s probably my favourite language at the moment, node.js. However, I saw it requires 4 packages to be installed. I also wanted to get OAuth integration working, but the current tutorial I felt just covered running the sample code and not creating your own apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a demo Alexa skill showing the GENOME LINK API working in AWS Lambda with no extra modules (uses just https module). I've also written a guide on how to use the GENOME LINK API with Alexa, on setting up Account Linking with OAuth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skill involves account linking and returning data about a selection of traits from the API. The skill is currently (06/04/18) under review by Amazon so might not be available publicly yet. If judges want access please message me with the email address associated with your Amazon account and I will add you to the beta tester list &amp; email you a link to access the skill with.

                <p>
                    There's another file called keybits.js which should act as a good starting point for building AWS Lambda functions (or just other lightweight node.js applications).

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially account linking was quite a pain, but that's the point of the guide!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it easier to use the GENOME LINK API for future developers and laying the foundations for more impressive applications to be built.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use the GENOME LINK API on AWS Lambda, how OAuth works and how Alexa Account Linking works. Also learnt a bit of basic genomics because I was interested, however the GENOME LINK API makes it easy to use without any scientific knowledge!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That's up to other developers. With the code released into the public domain people are free to do what they choose with it pretty much and I hope this spurs development of node.js apps / apps based in the cloud / on microservices. One thing that I haven't explored is the legal aspects of dealing with genomic data in the cloud, for example with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.
                </p>

                    I may explore contributing to the

                    library in the future too, perhaps simplifying some of the code or writing more documentation for it.
