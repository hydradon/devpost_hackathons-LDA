                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had all wanted to create a video game for a long time. When discussing ideas for the hackathon I threw out the idea of a university simulator and my teammates loved it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game simulates running a university in all kinds of ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split the work into front end and back end. I worked on the front end (graphics, music, etc) and my teammates worked together on the back end. When it was time to combine our efforts we worked together to integrate our creations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of problems trying to make the front end and back end compatible. Additionally, none of us have made a video game before or worked in C# or with Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a lot of work done. We are happy to have conquered most of the most difficult challenges. We did a lot that we weren't sure we were capable of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all much more experienced with C# and game development now. I learned a lot about graphic design which I will continue to utilize after this event is over. We also learned a lot about managing code effectively, especially when working in a team. Things can get very messy very quickly if you aren't careful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for University Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all want to continue to develop this project. We have a lot of plans for additional features that we could add to University Simulator. We have talked about developing the game enough to release on the market.
