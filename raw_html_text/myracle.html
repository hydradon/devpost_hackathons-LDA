                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all love music, we love singing along even more
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides lyrics for a musically interested listener to read
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went through many APIs to see what would work. Eventually we landed on writing our own pseudo API, because API key permissions interfered with our project.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Struggling to import software development kits
Integrating Web APIs with our software (Gracenote, APIseed, DJ Web Browser...)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it to work! :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most basic fundamentals can take ridiculous amounts of time in java if the programmer is not aware of a specific solution. Design is important, but we spent a long time trying to implement very simple concepts in our code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Myracle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Audio stream fingerprint integration! Our program will recognize the audio played around the device, and then provide the user lyrics for ease of access plus adding a different realm of functionality.
