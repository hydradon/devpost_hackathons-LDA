                    Human trafficking is a global problem and also one of the most prevalent issues today. We hope to help the fight against trafficking with our website.

                <h2>
                    We have an interactive quiz for users to take that determines if he or she is a victim of sex trafficking. It also presents myths and realities regarding human trafficking. We also have survivor stories to inspire new hands to join the fight against trafficking.

                    We had a breakdown with our code in the last minutes as well as group communication errors, but at the end of the day I think we all pulled it together and made everything work.

                <h2>
                    We are proud of putting together an interactive website that will hopefully change the world.

                <h2>
                    We learned that working together as a team is important, if any communication errors happen there could be a huge problem. Also we learned that we should proofread earlier, as we saw a breakdown in our code in the last few minutes.
