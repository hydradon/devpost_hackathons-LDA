                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We liked Typeform's chatty style of presentation, giving you questions one by one. We immediately thought - why not have it as an actual chat?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presents your typeforms over text to a group of users of your choice.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a PHP web app using the Slim microframework, for quick'n'easy development and deployment in the 36 hours. We had a lot to learn during our time at the hackathon and so it was important for our workflow to be as frictionless as possible.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Guy had never worked with OAuth before, and so it was initially challenging getting an access token from Typeform. 
Piers had never touched PHP, APIs, databases with PDO, or web dev before Friday evening - but has enjoyed getting his teeth into the challenge.

                        I've never been to a hackathon before - I was kind of nervous on the day of HackUPC but super syked to learn some new skills.

                    What's next for typeform text
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twilio supports a variety of programmable messaging channels, such as Whatsapp, LINE and GSM RCS. It'd be great to bring Typeform to those platforms too (which Twilio's APIs make super easy).
