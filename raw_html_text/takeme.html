                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As children of families whose parents like to travel often, we often have to help our parents in the planning process of the trip. With a multitude of websites open at once ranging from Google, to TripAdvisor, to Yelp, we noticed how tedious this process was and wondered if there was a website that streamlined this process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a website that streamlines the process of making travel plans. The user is able to explore the different attractions, activities, food, etc. in an area of their choice. After viewing a selection of options in the area, the user is able to add items into their "shopping cart" in order to then plan each day of their vacation. The final itinerary should show a map of the path of their vacation and the itinerary they have created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We prototyped our website on Figma and we created the website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We also planned to use the Yelp API and Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of being able to use the Yelp API and implement it on our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of students from a wide, diverse range of majors such as English, ISF, and Data Science, we are proud that we were able to create a website at the end of the hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was a part of Cubstart so we had a broad overview of material leading up to the hackathon, including but not limited to html, css, javascript, figma, flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TakeMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although our website does not have full functionality, we plan to add a few features. We are looking to add a profile aspect where one can save their different travel projects and itineraries. These different projects can be made to share to a community forum where other users can view different published itineraries to draw off inspiration for their own vacation plans. One could also import an itinerary they find on the community forum and edit it to fit their personal plans.
