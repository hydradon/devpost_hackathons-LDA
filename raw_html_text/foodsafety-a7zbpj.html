                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by one of our family members who recently got food poisoning from a contaminated food product.

                    FoodProbe is a
                    <strong>
                        search engine

                    for food products/companies that have been issued an official recall.
It also has a
                    <strong>

                    </strong>
                    for anyone to make a post about possible food contamination before the official reports are made.
Users can choose to
                    <strong>

                <p>
                    We built it using
                    <strong>
                        vue.js and firebase
                    </strong>

                <p>
                    We had to learn Vue.js and firebase for the first time.
