                    I was inspired by my own story of being confused by the financial system and what I needed to do to improve my credit score. After missing a few payment deadlines when I was young, I was sent to a collection agency which dramatically lowered my credit score. It took years to rebuild my history and I would like others that are in the same situation, to have a clear path on how to achieve credit-worthiness.
