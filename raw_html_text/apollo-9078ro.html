                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firechat app got us to think about creating a peer-to-peer messaging app. We started by using WiFi P2P but then could not figure out how to send messages between devices. We then switched to Bluetooth messaging
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Turn on your Bluetooth and have your buddy do the same and connect via Bluetooth and start chatting with the Apollo app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found for Bluetooth connecting and added in code to send messages and then listen for messages, then changed up the UI with the high-quality UI we made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WiFi P2P API for Android was hard to understand and sending and receiving messages was just about impossible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was able to connect two devices through WiFi P2P (later got removed), Made a cool UI with high-quality 9Patches,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Apollo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expand Apollo to use P2P instead of Bluetooth. This will increase the distance you can be between users, it would also allow for group sending messages. Also to be able to support files, that way you can send more than just text but also some cool picture.
