                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A long time ago some friends and I used to love a game called Ace of Spades, we wanted to re-create it for the web, allowing anyone on any platform to play together, without having to install anything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a Multiplayer First Person Shooter Game with a focus on a single massive border skirmish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Map is generated using a combination of 'THREE.js' and 'A-Frame'. Multiplayer is handled using 'Socket.IO'. Our game was made from scratch in 'Node.js'
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used THREE.js for the terrain rendering with higher level libraries like a-frame lacking the performance to render the geometry count we required for a realistic voxel terrain, perlin noise to generate the terrain, a-frame for the characters and character -  character interaction. We used node.js for the server side, passing events on a websocket transport and running a self made game engine on the server to handle player interaction events such as shots fired and blocks placed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Performance was a massive challenge, we had to re-write the voxel rendering code with a lower level api and merging meshes to create larger meshes in order to increase performance. In the end we managed to get a decent sized map into 14 or so draw calls and a couple thousand triangles, which runs at whatever monitor's framerate we threw at it. (including 165hz)
                </p>
