                        Aviation has always been a huge part of Rebecca's (our founder) life. Her father was a pilot and still works in aviation. She and the rest of her family are pilots as well. Rebecca graduated from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University where she studied Mechanical Engineering. Rebecca went to work for an oil field service company upon graduation which allowed her to travel all over the world. She began to spend more time in airports, which opened her eyes to an overwhelming problem. Airports were built for utility first and the human aspect was secondary. Airports engrain a disconnected and isolating culture and that never sat well with Rebecca. That's when she knew that she needed to come up with a solution for this problem. Her hope is that one day people will actually enjoy their airport experience because of Ment.

                        Ment is an airport based application that allows users to connect to and share information with other travelers in real-time. For the hyperconnected traveler looking for a unique airport experience, Ment is a one-stop solution that optimizes and saves on airport time while creating a connected culture in a once isolated and disconnected environment. Unlike other airport apps, Ment provides travelers real-time interactions and user-generated content specific to the individual's current airport in an intuitive way.
