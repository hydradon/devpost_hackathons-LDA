                <p>
                    We had no ideas for this event. We came here with no idea what to expect or do. Then someone told us to "create something we wish we had". So J White decided we should create a scheduling app that literally tells you what you should do throughout your day. Since J White finds Google Calendar annoying to use, and since our project will be doing many of the same things as Google Calendar, we decided to call our project "Kill Google Calendar".

                    So we have decided to write an app for Android that will literally tell you what to do throughout your day--slowly turning you into a mindless automaton, while the machines around you get smarter and smarter.
