                    It's literally just a powerpoint explaining my solution and what I learned, sorry to disappoint if you came for complex programming stuff.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I used basic maths, which as it turns out is more efficient and reliably correct than trying to use fancy maths. I guess that's kind of the whole point of the presentation tbh.
I also used Google Slides. I guess listing technologies is usually how people answer this bit...

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    My lack of knowledge of maths. Seriously, I'm a Psych student the most complex maths I've done since starting uni is slopes of lines so I had no right thinking I'd be able to solve a maths challenge in a room full of hardcore STEM people.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was the first one to solve the problem and won the challenge - always nice to win things. I also gained an unreasonable amount of confidence in the degree to which I deserve to be here. It's easy to get intimidated in this space by how overskilled everyone is, so it's nice to find that my more limited knowledge and skillset is still enough to get the job done and ultimately I was the only one who did get it done at all.

                    What I learned

                    1 - Even the most basic techniques can be valuable tools when applied correctly and efficiently. 
2 - Try everything even if you're unsure of your skill level, otherwise you'll never know whether or not you can do it and you'll never learn from mistakes you might have made.
3 - Sometimes simple is best
