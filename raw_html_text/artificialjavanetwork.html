                    We started to build a visualization-tool for DeepNeuralNetworks with direct (neuron-wise) user-interaction on the structure of the network

                    Neural-Network structure is working and can be feeded by a data matrix

                    To make our lifes harder we used Java (Yay!)
(But thats okay because we are all first-time-hackers, this was the only language we all knew and (nevertheless!) we had a lot of fun :) )

                    We all agree that this experience teached us a lot about programming and especially our own skills, e.g. the lack of software engineering ability and knowledge. This was the first time for all of us to form a relatively large group for programming and I think the whole hackathon teached us what people call "soft skills" for working together - like thinking about cool ideas, trying to figure out how to implement it and don't get too annoyed if someone's not sharing your opinion.
We also learned, that java is not the best choice. But it was our's, so we did the best we could and we still think that our idea was pretty cool! Even though we had to make the experience of horribly long javacode and messy style before - for the next time, we are prepared and we already have a lot of ideas how to make things better.
