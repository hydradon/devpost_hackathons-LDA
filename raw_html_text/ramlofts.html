                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration of this project was to learn new Computer Science skills which include, exploring unity and 3D representations.

                <p>
                    This project, located on a website, is to help users determine where the perfect house is for them by inputting data and viewing a 3D representation of the house they are interested in as well as the surrounding houses.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity to operate and design the 3D representations of the real estate shown on apartments.com. In addition, javascript and dialogflow were used to create the chatbot. Lastly, html and css were used to create the front end of the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into is hosting a domain and linking the code to that domain to make it accessible on a public website. We also ran into trouble using unity since Zach, the creator of the 3D represtation, had never used unity before and so there was a huge learning curve.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of finishing the website as it was a lot to code.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code in unity and that sleeping for two hours actually makes you realize even more how tired you actually are.
