                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The five of us coming from a bank background understood the need to streamline and simplify while not sacrificing efficiency and user friendliness. Add a dash of fun and something everyone looks forward to in their lives and we landed on BlockParty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A P2P system using the security, immutability, and functionality of Blockchain. The partnership of a front-end app enables users to simplify what makes event planning complex and time consuming.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the Business track we worked out the mechanics of how BlockParty would be built, the parts of blockchain technology we could tap into and the economics and financials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was coming up with our concept. We brainstormed, side tracked, dug into one idea conceptually, pivoted and landed on another idea that all 5 of us were excited about.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of starting off with limited knowledge about blockchain and in three short days have a fully flushed out proposal of something pretty awesome.

                    Is everything too much? we learned about blockchain. Various block chain programs, programming, systems, current trends, capabilities.
