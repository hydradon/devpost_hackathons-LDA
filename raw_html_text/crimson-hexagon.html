                    I ultimately was not able to finish this project in the time limit. I got the class that parses books into a python dictionary to work, but am far too tired to set up the machine learning aspects of this project. I'll do it later. I've had this project in mind for a while now, and mainly want it as part of my portfolio. I'm honestly not even sure it would apply to any of the challenges.
