                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Engineering professors very often need to represent 3d objects as figures and examples for classroom instruction. Until now, they have been limited to representing these shapes in 2D as a hand drawn figure from someone who is (lets be honest) usually not the best at drawing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows professors to access virtual reality models to use for classroom examples, and manipulate them in real time to give students an intuitive understanding of concepts that would normally be hand drawn. Professors can create and manipulate models, move them in the virtual environment, highlight relevent parts of models, and hide sections of it as they are giving explanations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Oculus Rift with the Oculus SDK, Unity 3D Personal, the Unity Multiplayer tools, coded in c# to create our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiplayer networking is a big challenge to use for the first time. We envisioned our application to connect teacher to student through the internet, but syncing the displayed models with the oculus rift over the internet would be something we would have to implement in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully created an immersive virtual environment using the Unity Graphics Engine with almost zero prior 3d modeling experience or experience using the Oculus SDK. Our models can be manipulated and function as teaching tools just as they were designed to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop virtual reality experiences! it is now not such a far leap to go into making rich, enveloping environments with seamless UI and excellent tools for both students and teachers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Virtual Engineering Classroom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add online streaming support so that students would not have to be in the same classroom as a teacher to have the same immersive experience. We would like to create a more beautiful environment, and add model manipulation tools for teachers, as well as separate manipulations privileges between student and teacher.
