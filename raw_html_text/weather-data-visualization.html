                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team is made up of a computer engineering major and a combined math and economics major with a minor in computer science. Both of us have experienced coding in a traditional classroom setting, given a pre-canned assignment in the context of a specific assigned task with clear completion. This challenge represented a new paradigm of coding assignment. There is no clear reference sheet, no clear path, just us and our ability to learn. We wanted to explore the field of website development, with no experience, so this is how we did it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website takes a set of data from 538's github repositiory about us-weather data. This dataset was chosen because of it's clean structure and csv format which d3 supports.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with a crash course session learning the basics of CSS and HTML. Then we moved on to javascript and d3. This was genuinely a ground up operation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a while trying to understand at a high level how some actions are done within websites. For example, it took a while to understand how data from a file is read into something usable. Next we had to format this data so that it could be used by the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team chemistry was our proudest accomplishments. We came into the hack knowing what we wanted to do, and had a great time due to our open communication and desire to work together. Seeing the chart finally show up on the screen was pretty cool too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tons. HTML, CSS, Javascript, how websites work. The amount of knowledge gained has vastly changed our perceptions of the field of coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Weather Data Visualization
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to address some bugs in the code. Some of the charts aren't quite showing up properly, but overall the concept was proven and the data visualization looks really cool!
