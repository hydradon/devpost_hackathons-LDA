                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wolfenstein, Doom, and raycasting legends from the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Send out rays from a playrs position and lines it up with an array full of information about walls and free spaces to walk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Visual Studio and the Simple DriectMedia Layer library, I was able to put the main part together in the first day and some change of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Loading textures into the different regions of the game proved to be difficult and borderline game-breaking. This will be revisited in the near future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting raycasting to work, learning another aspect of SDL, improving the writing of my classes and functions in everyday programming, and making my state manager dynamic (Vector/Stack implementation)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you know a base of something, don't be afraid to branch off into something new and jump into some code. Deliberate too long and nothing (or something worth nothing) might be the result!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Raycaster Challenge (SDL/C++)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A love letter to Wolfenstein hopefully. I love working with C++ and SDL because I'll be able to do cool stuff like that and learn a lot about development in one swift strike.
                </p>
