                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I worked in construction right out of high school. I noticed many laborers would arrive late or leave early, sometimes skipping hours of work a day. Seeing this problem, I asked what a contractor would need to prevent these actions from delaying projects or costing thousands a year. I though of a system where laborers would sign in at the beginning of the day, and out at the end, with their logs being verified by geolocation services. POP'n was born!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    t allows administrators to create "location sites" where a user/worker can "POP'n" -to, check in, and then be verified by geolocation services. The data would then be sent to an administrator for reporting or viewing at a later time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We deployed an instance of a JavaScript Google Firebase cloud database to power the backend of the web app. We then spun a Linode Linux server help together by a Jupyter Notebook to host the web app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other than running out of RedBull, the allotted timeframe was not quite enough to build the app we envisioned, but it was enough time to prove to ourselves that we could accomplish what we did on 36 hours without sleep and trust in new found friends.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with new technology such as Firebase really pumped us up.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to correctly manage a small group of software engineers throwing out ideas for the app.
