                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The iBeacon that Andre (our teammate) had. We wanted to be able to utilize this geolocation sensor on Boston College's Campus. To make life easier for students and professors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Via Bluetooth, it connects to smartphones and sends notifications or data values that can notify students how many people are currently at the Plex or what the menu at lower dining hall is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using react native to create the mobile app and we used Firebase for the backend database using java-script to create real time dynamic data. We also used html to create the web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we faced were connecting our noSQL database which would provide real-time updates to our web application which would also be connected to the mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a mobile application that connects via Bluetooth to the iBeacon that notifies professors and students when they are within the signal radius.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use a NoSQL database in which we had no prior experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cloud City
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the network effect, the more users that use this app and connect to the iBeacon, the more useful the data and information signals. We want to do this on a wider scale in which every building and well-populated areas are within the radius of iBeacons that can transmit useful information based on the specific location and scenario.
