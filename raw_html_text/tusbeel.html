                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the absence of information, people are not aware of cultural events and can't attend to this, for that is Tusbeel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tusbeel recommends culture events by categories near to you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use a data base which contains a set of cultural events so that we could retrieve them and displayed them on the web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge was in the from-end part, because we had some constraints at building the UI. Other challenge was in the back-end part because some relationships got lost and we had to redefine the data base structure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could end the principal front-end page and load some events from the data base.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the process of constructing the UI, the team learned some fundamentals aspects of JavaScript and PHP, and in the back-end we reinforced the knowledge of PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tusbeel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enhance the front-end of the initial page and construct the ones related to the personal home page of a registered user. In the back-end part, we'll implement a machine learning algorithm that allows Tusbeel identify the preferences of the user and make better recommendations based on their interested events and the rating they choose.
