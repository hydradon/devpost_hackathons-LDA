                    The goal of the game is very similar to Hangman. However, this version is more educational specific and more directed towards certain subjects. There will be a question asked and the answer is hidden. If you don't know the answer, you can guess a letter. Be careful, it's three strikes and you're out! Everything is through speech recognition so enunciate! Hopefully this is a good study tool!
