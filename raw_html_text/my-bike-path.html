                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both bike to school and sometimes we do not know when to leave our homes in order to get to school at our desired time.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app takes your past times for bike rides and the distance from your home to school and calculates when to leave.
