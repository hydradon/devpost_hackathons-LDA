                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build an app that helps you choose nutritious meals around a goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Foodly helps you calculate a calorie and macronutrient goal and finds recipes to help you meet those goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided on an Android app and built it using Android Studio and Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Passing data between activities. The preference widgets not being extensible enough for our uses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three of us went from no Android dev experience to making an app with data persistence and several fragments and using data binding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three of us were very new to Android development. We learned a lot about Android and Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for foodly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration with grocery stores, an online api, and possibly even using machine learning for choosing better recipes.
