                    What it does - We are suggesting to focus on data analysis of selective Volunteer programs on where employee's heart lies and hence resulting to recurring participation and not just one day participation. This will also help in effective budget planning and usage of resources.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to above, we also thought that an Online Academy can be really easy and helpful to drive volunteers in IT industry.

                <h2>
                    How I built it - We thought that we could use StiboSystems to create the basic Data repository and thereafter use AWS on various ongoing marketing activities and predictive analysis too.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - To clean up the existing data or to start collecting this data from scratch before the analysis. Organisation would need to invest a lot of time in this effort.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - During the research we thought that we being non- technical people, we might not be able to present anything however, we were able to leverage help from sponsors to understand more about their system and leveraging that to give life to our idea.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - This idea was built by Business savvy people and hence we learnt a lot about the technology piece specially through presentations given by the sponsors.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Helping hands - To sell this idea within the organization
