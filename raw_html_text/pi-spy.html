                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Packages stolen during the holiday time
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    our device uses opencv to identify crimes and to alert business owners or other users. our test case was people stealing packages during the holidays
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used opencv to detect if a package is on your porch, or being delivered. if it was taken away, we alert the userof a possible crime with a live streaming camera allowing for anyone on the network to see the feed. we also have a customizable web interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we ran into many logic errors, and network issues. we also had a hard time with bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used machine learning and opencv for the first time and managed to incorporate more hardware into our hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned about machine learning, live streams, and getting out of your comfort zones can really help you broaden your skills.

                    What's next for Pi Spy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to work on having it identify violent behavior and alert the authorities. making it safer for communities.
