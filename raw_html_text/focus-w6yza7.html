                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Telekinesis has been a popular super power for a lot of human existence. Our original goal was to simulate the feeling of causing an object to levitate using an oculus rift. The original plan was to build a room in unity and use an oculus rift to suspend the player in a room full of boxes. The player would have been able to look at a box and using the muse headband, make a box levitate without touching any other input device. Unfortunately due to hardware constraints, we were unable to use the oculus rift, and instead made a balloon popping simulator.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Focus allows you to use your mental concentration to pop a virtual balloon.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The muse headband provides many OSC streams, that allow you to gather a lot of data about your brain. One of these streams is your "concentration" level. The balloon is static as you continue to focus on it, and once your "concentration" reaches a certain level, the balloon pops.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunetely we spent most of the first 10 hours of the hackathon trying to get an oculus rift to work on our laptops. Because of this constraint we were not able to complete our original goal,  but decided to stick with muse, in order to gain knowledge of the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had interfaced with OSC before, nor had we analyzed brain waves. It was very satisfying to watch a sphere move across the screen without touching anything for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the value of researching hardware compatibility before deciding on a project, and organizing a plan before the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Focus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are still very excited about our original plans to integrate the muse headband in a 3d environment via oculus rift. We would very much like to explore that idea further, possibly at a future hackathon where we would bring better hardware.
