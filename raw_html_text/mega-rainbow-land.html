                    This is my program for MVHacks 2019. My game attempts to solve boredom and entertain people with its bright and vivid colors, and the smooth gameplay. I have made this program completely from scratch, coding everything from the pattern of colors to the animation in the beginning. I have been working on this project the moment I connected to the Wi-Fi. The game is completely functional and has no known bugs which were found during the 45 minutes of debugging. The UI is bright and minimalistic, with the player being entranced by the pattern of rainbow colors. The game is mostly self-explanatory, and if someone wishes,  they can change the rate of gameplay to make it easier or harder by increasing the frame rate. Finally, the program was made in Javascript on Khanacademy, for a lack of another editor.
