                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to design a web app that allows a user to get a fitness plan tailored to their capabilities and lifestyle that is simple and clean.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generates a fitness plan for a user based on their goals, experience level, and number of days they want to exercise each week.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was created using the MEAN.JS stack along with Materialize for CSS styling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the database and understanding what was needed from the MEAN stack for this project was time consuming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The clean interface and algorithm for determining a user's workout plan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a MEAN stack application can be very difficult to tackle efficiently.
                </p>

                    What's next for git fit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more options for users to get a more specific workout plan. Also add the ability to allow the creation of custom workout plans and include professional workout plans from top fitness programs.
