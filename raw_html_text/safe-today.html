                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something we have never done before. Distracted driving is a
                    <strong>
                        huge
                    </strong>
                    problem facing our society. This app helps to eliminate that problem. Furthermore, reading car computer logs help to integrate additional features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a user is driving and opens up the app, it will automatically connect to the OBDII reader through bluetooth. This allows the app to display features such as speed, and RPM. It also rejects phone calls unless the same caller has called 3 or more times within 30 minutes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized an OBDII reader to read the car's computer. To create the app, we built it through Android Studio with Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having never used Android Studio before, it was a learning curve. There were multiple issues that arose as we tried to implement bluetooth and the OBDII libraries. Sleep deprivation is honestly a huge challenge as hysteria kicks in.
