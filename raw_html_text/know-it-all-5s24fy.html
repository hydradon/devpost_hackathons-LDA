                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There has always been a language barrier and there will continue to be one. We try to remove that by using translation services so a Viewer can ask a Twitch Broadcaster a question in their native language and the broadcaster can understand it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The broadcaster initially sets up the configuration, setting their language and a knowledgebase of Questions with answers. These QnA combos help the extension answer some questions automatically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The viewer is then presented with a page in which they can ask a question in their own language. The question is translated, the knowledgebase searched and as a result we can either give the viewer an answer or relay the question asked to the broadcaster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each member of the team took a component, like AWS Polly, or AWS Translate and built their own service around this. The lead was then tasked with creating a coordinator to get these separate tasks communicating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time, with the team having full-time jobs or studies it was fairly difficult getting us all on the same page until almost the final week.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a working extension usable by any broadcaster. This extension is not restricted by the channel it's hosted on. We believe we have achieved a production we consider to be more than our initial MVP (minimal viable product) goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mixing technologies, experiences, timezones and langauges being a multi-national team is never an easy task, especially with the time constraints of each team member.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ATAM
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve interaction between config, dashboard and the panel. Improve backend reliability and make sure all services are correctly scaled and scalable.
