                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being the 5% diagnosed with stage IV cancer at a younger age empower me to understand many chronic patients and the elderly&rsquo;s challenge and mental health concerns. When cancer hits, I went back to my childhood love of music, dance and art, forgot how sick I was. Many patients like me stuck at home often, lack of exercise and community support, very easy to fall into depression, we want to make behavior change fun and easy for them.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Guided by BJ Fogg&rsquo;s behavior model, motivation, ability, and prompt are needed in order for behavior change to happen. We want to increase ability by providing pre-recorded personalized videos that are 24/7 available to isolated patients and the elderly via a telehealth platform, bring in the most effective behavior prompt, which is group support and a compatible accountable buddy.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app with XCode, Swift, and the open-source VisionFaceTrack API from Apple. Our goal is to enable emotion tracking and identify whether or not watching dance videos significantly improves a person&rsquo;s emotional well-being.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial goal was to employ Affectiva&rsquo;s emotion tracking API to yield emotion percentages and get more accurate statistics of emotional well being. Due to legacy objective-c code as well as some incompatibility with current iOS versions, we instead chose to utilize the VisionFaceTrack API to detect faces and change models based on different emotions.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud of developing an integrated product and being able to successfully download the app to our physical device. We&rsquo;re also proud of being able to plan out the business and social impact of our product in improving the quality of care for those who need it the most.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about several key technologies we can use for Emotion Tracking and how accurate such technologies are in characterizing different emotions. We also learned more about the nature of problems isolated patients face and how our app could potentially aid in enhancing their treatment.
                </p>

                    What's next for Dance4Healing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to continue developing this app to enable emotion labeling, creating user profiles, uploading dance video content, tracking emotions before/after the videos are displayed, and generating statistics on the quality of life for patients after our service was put in to place. We&rsquo;d also like to finish developing the app and integrating a video cloud base so that we can eventually run live in-person trials.
