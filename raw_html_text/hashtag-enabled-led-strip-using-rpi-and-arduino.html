                <p>
                    Internet connected color of led string based on twitter hashtag. Social interaction of twitter based input
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    when a twitter hashtag or word combination, in this case "TVCOG" the color on the led string cycles through a rainbow
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardware consists of a led light strip controller that was changed via a remote control, an arduino that controls the colors of the led lights, and a raspberry pi that handles the twitter interaction and hardware arduino I/0 with Johnny-Five
The led strip controller was used for the mosfets that drive an LED strip, all other chips were stripped off the board to directly connect the arduino pwm to the mosfet input logic. The raspberry pi needed several development packages installed and updated into a new configuration that was sparsely documented on the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The remote control on the led strip had limited information on the web and was just hacked for the power mosfet portion
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rpi current node application needs to be updated to 4.x to use Johnny-Five
