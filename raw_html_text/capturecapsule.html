                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People are taking more photos everyday, but these pictures often go forgotten within a few months. Nowadays, most photos are not printed, so reminiscing over old memories is much harder. We wanted to give people access to retrieve their old photos without the hassle of going through files from years ago.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can upload their pictures and decide a date to retrieve these photos. Our website will email the user on that date with a hashed key to access their memories.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used HTML and CSS for the front-end and connected it with Node.js and Express to handle the back-end.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both members of our team had no prior knowledge of Node.js and Express and very little knowledge of HTML and CSS
