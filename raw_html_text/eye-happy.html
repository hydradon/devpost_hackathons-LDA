                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the growing use of technology, our team aimed to provide an everyday solution to help those suffering from mental health illnesses that they may/may not be aware of. End the stigma.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A computer vision application that analyzes the eyes of the user to determine their level of stress and anxiety. Mental wellness is enhanced by sending the user positive, encouraging notifications that correlate directly with their observed level of anxiety.

                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Indigo API for computer vision. The application was coded in python.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to compile all code together and testing it until it runs smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are first time hackers and we are proud that were able to create a new application using computer vision APIs.
Some of the team was able to learn a new language (python), while others were able to learn how to use the computer vision APIs in a new creative way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a bit more about APIs and about computer vision application.
                </p>

                    What's next for eye calm:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To expand into other areas of the face to help better determine their level of stress anxiety.  Also a side code was developed for detecting how close a user is to their screen of the computer by outputting frequency waves.
