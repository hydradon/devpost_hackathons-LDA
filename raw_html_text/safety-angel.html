                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I looked at the well-planned roads and strict rules in the USA, I thought why not we? why not in India? Aren't we the fastest developing nation? These thoughts had stuck me a long time back from then but didn't find any ways or opportunities to fix it. I as a startup, when I read about Ford hackathon in the collaboration with the Indore government, I didn't waste time and started building Safety Angel, the smart and Machine Learning enabled local community app. I could win this contest, I hope I would get a chance to meet Indore Govt. officials and work together to take this product further for safer roads.
                </p>

                    I just want to make sure that a daughter who is waiting for her dad to return home after work to reach home safely. This inspires me the whole time building this product.

                    More about crowdsourced data node
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are multiple data nodes in our system which is feed with crowdsourced data coming from the Safety Angel application.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First crowdsourced data node is the users' location used to find the nearest/quickest helper for Crowdsourced SOS.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    a. Users who volunteer to become a Crowdsourced SOS helper/responder have to activate the feature in 'Track'--&gt;'Be an SOS Volunteer'. Once they activate this feature, their location is updated/tracked by our cloud system every 60 seconds[Could be a higher number but for demo purpose, we kept it small]. 
b. So whenever a victim is under distress s/he could either press SOS button On-Ride/On-Commute Dashboard or victim could press the headphone's button 4 to 6 times vigorously(pressing headphone's button is added here so as to not let the attacker know that vicitim is calling for help and get aggresive) to send out SOS distress signals to our server. [This feature works only when 'Track Me' feature is turned on. ] 
c. Now our server matches the victims location with the SOS responders location and automatically sends notifications to them saying 'Victim ABC in danger, help him/her'.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Second set of data nodes for crowdsourced data consists of users' feedback and rating for a bus, potholes and bumps detected by the users' devices, current traffic data provided by Google and current traffic data crowdsourced by Safety Angel app users by turning on their location in 'On Ride/On-Commute Dashboard' while on commute, and local rules or constraits like speed limits, school zones etc.. set by local authorities using 'Suggest Rule' option.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    --&gt;For Buses 
a. When user chooses 'Bus' as a mode of transportation in 'Ride' feature, and selects the destination s/he wants to go from his current location. Our system calculates 1 to 3 best routes the user could choose to reach the destination. Here the best routes are calculated using users feedback given to a specific bus on their route, the average delays by a specific bus on their route, the time of commute, traffic data crowdsourced by the users by turning on their location while on commute and the older days traffic data crowdsourced, and risk factors taken into the account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, User could choose the best route depending on the Risk Factors which is shown as a Risk Percentage Meter on the same screen. Which is calculated using risk factors invloved in the route like accident rates data on the available routes obtained from the earlier period, crime rates on the routes, speed ways etc...
                </p>
                <p>
                    User could also see the avg delays and ratings given by the Safety Angel community app users to the upcoming buses on the same screen to plan their commute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    b. Once the user chooses one route and starts the trip, s/he can see the nearby Safe Bus Stop Waiting areas marked the local authorities or communtity moderators using 'Suggest Rule'--&gt;'Mark Safe Bus Stop Waiting Area' option. [Crowdsourced Input for Safer Routes and Risk Factors]
                </p>
                <p>
                    c. User could call for crowdsourced SOS as mentioned above. Rate Buses and Bus Drivers whichever they board-on. [Input for Bus Avg Delays, Bus Rating]
                </p>
                <p>
                    --&gt; Other Mode of Transportation except Bus. 
a. When the user chooses other transportation mode expect bus in 'Ride' feature, and selects the destination s/he wants to go from his current location. Our system calculates 1 to 3 best routes the user could choose to reach the destination. Here the best routes are calculated using users feedback given to route after finishing their trip on Safety Angel, roads conditions like potholes and bumps automatically detected by our Safety Angel app users while commuting by turning on the On-Ride/On-Commute Dashboard [to simulate a bump/pothole, go to Ride--&gt; Select Bike/Car as the mode of transport--&gt;Select Destination and Route--&gt;Start Driving--&gt; Shake the phone vigoursoly to simulate a bump, you will get a toast saying 'Bump detected'. Now after 60seconds, you could see a circular green-red gradient patch at the location where the bump was detected by your device], accident rates, etc...
                </p>
                <p>
                    b. Once the user chooses one route and starts the trip, s/he can see the nearby Virtual Footpath, School Zones, Speed Limits marked the local authorities or communtity moderators using 'Suggest Rule'--&gt;'Mark Safe Bus Stop Waiting Area' option.

                <p>
                    Building an application which involves machine learning, recommendation model, real-time tracking, real-time vehicle alerting system involves a lot of moving part and has to be developed carefully. I found it bit hard to develop it in the very short time as I started to work on this lately.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before I could start working on the application, I had to go through all the literature and resources provided to understand the intensity of this problem. The first thing I learn the issues and the existing solutions in India and planned an upgrade around in keeping future in the mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technically speaking, I learned how to manage the design, development, and testing when there is very short time to complete. I was trying to develop dashboard for the traffic authorities and I couldn't finish it up due to lack of time. From next time, I will be much careful about it.
