                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all were drawn towards the JP Morgan Best Hack for Disaster Relief &amp; Recovery Challenge. Based on our research, we discovered that over 60% of people either have not developed/ do not practice a disaster safety plan. It is essential that everyone must have these kind of plans in order to fully maximize their safety and well-being during these dangerous and spontaneous situations. We decided to develop a app that both assists those who were affected by natural disasters and helps them develop a plan and prepare for an upcoming natural disaster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dr. Aid is a web app that assists the user during the whole natural disaster situation from before it occurs to the recovery period. First, the user can easily and quickly create a before, during and after natural disaster plan. The user will answer questions such as the designated meeting place of their family and emergency contact as well as provide information about each family members. Based on the responses and ages of the family members, Dr. Aid can easily generate safety plans and assign responsibilities to each member of the family. This way, when a natural disaster occurs, the family can easily access the web app and are immediately provided with their safety plan steps and their assigned responsibilities, wasting no time and maximizing their chances of safety. In addition, the user can refer to a map that pinpoints the locations of nearby shelters and hurricane hit areas. For quick and easy communication between the user and the shelter, we provided convenient text messaging that asks the user certain questions then sends to the shelter. Finally, we have a news feature where the user can be informed of the latest updates and news about the natural disaster they are currently experiencing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built this
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using React.js. We also used the Twilio API to have a communication feature between the user and nearby shelter, Google Maps API to provide a map for the Google Earth Hurricane Data. We programmed the software through the Atom IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble trying incorporating open source data from Google Earth because we couldn't get the data we wanted so we had to compromise. We also had problems with creating family members and incorporating user's responses into the disaster safety plan. We also wanted to use the NEWS API to get the latest news and updates about the natural disaster the user is currently in however, we did not have enough time to complete this feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to learn and implement many unfamiliar APIs in a short amount of time. Overall, we are just proud of how much we were able to complete in this short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through our research, we learned about the severity of natural disaster situations and how vital technologies like these can help victims. We also learned about the use and implementation of some API. Overall, we learned what it meant to work as a time since we constantly communicated and collaborated with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dr. Aid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since each natural disaster creates different challenges, we hope to create for each natural disaster including earthquakes, tornados, etc. We also hope to successfully implement the add new member/ account and using the user's responses, since this was one of the biggest challenges we wanted to fully complete during the hackathon. FInally, we hope to improve our news page by implementing the NEWS API.
