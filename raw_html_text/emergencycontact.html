                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people cannot reach out to their emergency contacts during their emergency and a result they die or get injured badly.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will send a message to the emergency contact they provided on the app and also send that person's current location to the contact.
                </p>
                <h2>
