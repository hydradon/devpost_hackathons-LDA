                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make a fun game ,to play with others.

                    The challenge required us to make a bot that communicates with a Unity server, and participate in a free for all kill fest. The tank with the highest points at the end of 5 minutes wins. This tank bot aims to maximize its kills and points banked by going around in a constant motion and have a scoring algorithm to find the most favorable bot to shoot at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started from scratch and constantly improving the design. First we started experimenting manually and see how the game is played , its rules and area. Made different algorithms for the movement of the tank-bot and its scoring algorithm for its opponents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Server side communication was hard to get. Python treating stuff like mod of negative numbers differently took a long time to fix. We also had to build a callback function to limit the number of API calls we send ,so we don't crash the server.
                </p>

                    Working as team, doing server communications which we were not comfortable with
