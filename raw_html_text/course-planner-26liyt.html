                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have ever had much programming experience and we were all looking to do something web based and to learn a lot.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal was to pull course data from the Scotty Labs API and then create a website for users to design their future schedules. We got through the Scotty Labs API and general website design okay, but when it can to implementing django and JavaScript (things no one on our team had ever done before) we ran into some difficulties. We spent a good while negotiating an authentication issue with the Google Sheets API and ultimately ran out of time before completing the functions needed to write all the data we wanted to the Sheet.

                <p>
                    Scotty Labs API for Course Data backs Website Users Use to ID the Courses they Want to Take and Place them onto a Google Sheet.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scotty Labs Course API was more a scraper program than an API we could call to.
Authentication with Google Sheets API.
Complexity of new languages and syntax we had never been exposed to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use APIs and their documentation.
Learning 2-3 new languages and strengthening our minimal skills.
Launching our first website!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Splitting front end/back end work.
Lots of syntax and logic.

                    Hopefully completion once we get a little more coding experience!
