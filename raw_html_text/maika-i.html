                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the devastation the water crisis in Flint, Michigan has caused. We realized that if someone had tested their water sooner, much of the harm caused by this event could have been avoided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our iOS app, tests the pH and pOH of water, using external hardware. It then analyzes the possible causes of any unnatural pH and pOH levels, and informs the user on how to handle the situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent some time looking at how to create an iOS app, using Xcode. We also asked a few mentors on tips for building an iOS app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble figuring out the syntax and format of Xcode. We also had to restart our project around half-way through because our Xcode crashed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We persevered and managed to rebuild our app with the remaining hours. We also managed to learn the basics of Xcode in less than 12 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of creating an iOS app through Xcode and Swift. We also learned a lot behind the science of pH levels and their correlation with the contents of your water.
                </p>

                    What's next for maika'i
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connections to medical professionals and law enforcement in case of serious contaminations, more in depth education to users about the negative consequences of drinking contaminated water, and finding a cheap way to manufacture our technology to make it accessible to third world countries.
