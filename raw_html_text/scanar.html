                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build it because we wanted to build something ARKit. It then struck us that AR has a lot of potential in e-commerce, so we thought that ARKit could be used to streamline the shopping process further.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The plan was to get "an amazon dash for everything," but we ended up with an application that can link barcodes to products.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Swift, Xcode, APIs
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the Barcode API and ARKit.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about ARKit
                </p>

                    What's next for ScanAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding ARKit functionality to the application. Also, better barcode compatibility because of the different types of barcodes.
