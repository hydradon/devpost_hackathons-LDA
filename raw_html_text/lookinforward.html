                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this project, we were inspired mainly by the concept of creating an innovative and unique client experience, as well as a futuristic and unique take on solutions to problems which banks of today face. Moreover, our inspiration circulates around ways to find possible solutions to various technological issues, and how these issues can be solved when it comes to the comfort, guaranteed security, and efficiency of the client, so their experience could be optimized when it comes to their digital banking experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of LookinForward is not only to provide a personalized, efficient banking experience, but is mainly focused on the concepts of providing an inclusive digital banking experience for everyone who has the desire to partake in any form of digital banking. LookinForward delivers a unique personalized experience, as well as completely accessible and intractable technology through the utilization of virtual reality, in order to further assist individuals who find it difficult to access a bank, but still desire to receive the full package and experience right at home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the integration of Virtual and Augmented reality in our project, LookinForward aims to deliver to you a personalized experience where you can experience limitless possibilities with plenty of features. We used oculus rift as a VR headset and figma and HTML to create our mockups. We also used GCloud and python to simulate the machine learning algorithms that would define the underlying structure of our project, and ultimately bring the whole banking experience to our client, without walking a single step.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When utilising the oculus rift as a VR headset, connecting to the oculus was pretty difficult as we ran into problems connecting with the HDMI cable. As our group had limited experience using the AR kit and VR headsets in general, we had to put our problem solving, analytical, and teamwork abilities to use, so we could receive an effective and efficient output, in order to optimize the experience of the clients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, we are very proud of the final product we have created and are super proud of our process we utilised order to achieve our goals with this project, and create something unique and innovative. In addition, something we strove towards was the overall inclusivity and accessibility of this design, and the way it allows many different types of people with different abilities to engage in digital banking in an efficient way. We also were proud of our ability to work as a team and use each others strengths in order to build upon our project, and improve our own strengths and skills in the process.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop AR apps in Unity for IOS environment. We also learnt about a lot of current problems faced by digital banking techniques.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LookinForward
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to include voice integration into our design by utilizing voiceflow in order to improve the quality, as well as the customer satisfaction levels. By adding this, we hope to further improve personalization levels, as well as add a greater amount of accessibility in order to open the doors of digital banking for a greater number of individuals.
