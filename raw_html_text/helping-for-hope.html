                    We were inspired by the hardships our community has faced with the opioid crisis. We wanted to make more resources available for people struggling with this addiction. It is an app of compiled resources to help opioid addiction battlers get a better support system. It features an anonymous support group through mobile application, weekly videos of survival stories and anything related to the opioid addiction, support group finder with nearby locations, and it also has a feedback feature where people can submit questions and comments that they have. We used a Javascript Framework API, which utilizes radar.io for map detection. One challenge we faced was that, we made a questionnaire for opioid battlers to use but could not upload it on the app. Another challenge was that many of our teammates have not created an app before. We are are proud of providing a solution to a problem that we deeply care about and want to make an impact on. We want to add one-on-one counseling, helpline, and content sharing
