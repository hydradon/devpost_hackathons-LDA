                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A post on DevRant by a hearing impaired developer who describes the impact of technology and automation in improving quality of life for individuals with disabilities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A wristband that detects sirens in real time, and alerts the wearer of their presence. The target audience is hearing impaired individuals who drive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use the Urban Sound Dataset to train a neural network to recognize the sound of sirens. The application then signals the Myo wristband which vibrates to alert the wearer. We used Python bindings for the Myo SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving model performance, working with corrupt data, microphone issues, training in AWS, attempting to port application to Android
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a prototype working; understanding how neural networks work as beginners to machine learning;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for Siren Detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Move all functionality to a smart watch; extend to detect other life threatening sounds like gunshots, trucks backing up, fire alarms, etc.
