                    Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally the idea was just to animate a single object around the window. I wanted to expand on it and include 2 objects that would be related to one another, leading to a chase.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started to learn Python and this animation was a small, simple project for me to practice!
I learned a lot about using the Pygame module, and the concepts behind building games.
It was also a challenge to debug the program and it was really rewarding when it finally worked.
