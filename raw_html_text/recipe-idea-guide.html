                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever have a fridge full of food but no idea what to make with all of it? Now you don't have to waste time guessing what to make!

                    RUN ON IDLE 3.x !!!!
This program scrapes data from a recipe website to give a user meal ideas. The user can enter key word(s) that are either food items (ex. "bacon": "I have bacon... what can I make with that?") or a general meal idea that he/she is thinking of making (ex. "cake": "I want to make a cake, but I don't know which kind"). The program will generate various meal ideas based on the key words that the user enters. Finally it will open a link to the recipe so the user can see the ingredients and cooking/baking instructions! Sweet.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python and BeautifulSoup to scrape recipe titles from a recipe website.

                <p>
                    Scraping information from a website with varying HTML tags. For some recipes, there were tags, and for others there were not. It also doesn't run on my Linux terminal, but works fine in IDLE.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I haven't ever used BeautifulSoup or scraped a website before! I also haven't used Python in years. I'm proud up that I taught myself new skills and brushed up on my rusty ones. I also have never submit a project at a hackathon before and I took on this project on all on my own!

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that scraping from the web is actually pretty easy. I also learned that humans need sleep.

                    Printing the ingredients and cooking/baking instructions in the terminal instead of opening the web browser. Also to update it so it will be able to run in Linux terminal instead of just IDLE 3.x.
