                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Video game development and practicality rarely do mix, but when they do, the results can be surprising. BattleForm is my take on forms which aims to yield the responses wanted by the company while providing the leisure of those who take it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is a interactive way for any interest group to consistently give feedback. Players are presented with a side-scrolling shooter game that every so often will present a choice, which can be shot at to "submit" a response. The responses are then recorded and stored for analysis and data warehousing.
