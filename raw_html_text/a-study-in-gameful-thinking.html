                    My name is Copernicus and I crash-landed on the Moon. My computer was invaded by digital number bugs. I need your help to unlock our command center. As we speak, digital bugs are working against us. The only device that is still operational is this small communication part with a blue circle light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To play the game you will need the number map from bit.ly/numbermap or view the screen in the Alexa mobile app, Alexa video device, or in a web browser under alexa.amazon.com.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are three game levels. The first level is about identifying numbers on a list. You will think of a number, I will ask you 4 yes/no questions, and then I will tell you the number you are thinking about. Next, at the Boss Level, you will investigate the number pattern on the number map to find the number I am thinking about. The Super Boss level is so cool, I can't even talk about it here. I'm glitching just thinking about it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Will you help Copernicus in this lunar rescue mission?
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Alexa devices just say: "open Copernicus rescue". On FireTV you may need to say: "open Copernicus Lunar Rescue" instead of just "open Copernicus rescue". To enable the skill on Echo devices say: Enable Copernicus Lunar Rescue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note for teachers:
The game is simple to use. Your students play the game by answering yes or no questions. You can print out the number map for them or display it on any screen. The map will show questions by question if you login to alexa.amazon.com.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use this skill to teach students about numbers, basic math of addition, the astronomer Copernicus, the heliocentric world view, the landscape of the Moon (Tycho and Copernicus craters), and the audio clips will relate to the historical US Moon exploration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you ask for a tip, the skill will tell you something interesting about the Moon. A sample tip: "The lunar craters, or holes in the ground that look like volcanoes, were formed by asteroids and comets that collided with the moon. These are named for scholars, scientists, artists and explorers. For example, Copernicus Crater is named for Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer who realized 500 years ago that the planets move about the sun."

                <p>
                    Once you reach the Boss Level you can ask for a hint. If you ask for help you will receive a password to unlock the mathematical foundation of the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you print the number map from
                    <a href="http://bit.ly/numbermap" rel="nofollow">
                        http://bit.ly/numbermap
                    </a>
                    you can use the game with the inexpensive Echo Dot in the classroom or, once your students understand the process, you can have students play with each other.

give me a tip
help
I don't now
stop
