                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are drowning in a world full of unclassified text due to lack of training data.
In a world, where mass text classifiers require mass acquisition of accurate data, creating custom text classifiers does not scale. We wanted to create an idea that would crowd-source the creation of this training data, allowing any users regardless of ability or knowledge of classifiers to participate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two user-facing parts to the application: a Tinder-esque web app, and a chrome extension. Users of the chrome extension can highlight text on a web page and immediately submit it to a pre-defined class. These classifications are then fed to the Tinder-style app, where users are presented with pieces of text from a certain class and they have to decide whether it is correct or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future the app will provide reward points for users that select the class that is chosen by the majority of people, providing them with a motive to use the app. We're imagining someone sitting down when they're dilly-dallying waiting for a bus, and opening up Pidgeoniser to earn a couple of quid.
