                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two weeks ago, I was tinkering with my phone and was forced to reset my phone. Losing my contacts. 
On another occasion, I was stranded phone-less &ndash;&ndash; and I didn't remember crucial contacts.
There was no way to get in touch with my people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    phoneNotIncluded enables users to store their phone-book/contacts into a database, which they can access and add via a web application, or call/text via anyone's phone. (Yes, a stranger's phone &ndash;&ndash; whether a flip phone, or the latest iPhone). You can assure yourself that the stranger will not contact your loved ones, as the conversations are masked through generic proxy numbers, and are quickly terminated when you're done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a several Twilio APIs: Proxy, Programmable SMS, Programmable Voice, and .
Gather is used for a secure initial login via a phone call.
Proxy is used to route a secure phone conversation through a masked phone number. 
SMS is used to forward messages to your contacts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I added a mongo database where contacts will be kept and synchronized to a React front-end web application, and visual interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I initially ran into trying to use one API (Twilio Proxy) for all of my use cases. I ended up using the rest of the APIs to fulfill the needs to my initial goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I gained great exposure to building a project that has immediate impact on my life.
I had
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned all about using Twilio Proxy back and forth.
I learned about connecting a text-messaging interface with a React front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for phoneNotIncluded
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to scale the application so others have the opportunity to access and interact with their contacts.
Additionally, it is a big tool for those who cannot afford to have a personal phone. Though, by using other people's phone and the web they can access and communicate with their contacts.
