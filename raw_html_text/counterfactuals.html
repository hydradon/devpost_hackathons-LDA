                    Counterfactuals for Machine Learning Models
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A counterfactual explanation describes a situation in the form: &ldquo;If X had not occurred, Y would not have occurred&rdquo;. For example: &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t taken a sip of this hot coffee, I wouldn&rsquo;t have burned my tongue&rdquo;. Event Y is that I burned my tongue; Cause X for this event is that I had a hot coffee.
                </p>

                    In interpretable machine learning, counterfactual explanations can be used to explain predictions of individual instances. The &ldquo;event&rdquo; is the predicted outcome of an instance, the &ldquo;causes&rdquo; are the particular feature values of this instance that were input to the model and &ldquo;caused&rdquo; a certain prediction.

                    Example
                </h3>
                <p>
                    ML powers quite a lot of automated decision making software these day. Repeat offender analysis, credit score, grants, etc.
Peter applies for a loan and gets rejected by the (machine learning powered) banking software. He wonders why his application was rejected and how he might improve his chances to get a loan. The question of &ldquo;why&rdquo; can be formulated as a counterfactual: 
What is the smallest change to the features (income, number of credit cards, age, &hellip;) that would change the prediction from rejected to approved? 
One possible answer could be: If Peter would earn 10,000 Euro more per year, he would get the loan. Or if Peter had fewer credit cards and hadn&rsquo;t defaulted on a loan 5 years ago, he would get the loan. Peter will never know the reasons for the rejection, as the bank has no interest in transparency, but that&rsquo;s another story.

                    What I built
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A script that will take in a particular instance, a machine learning model, and provide an example closest to the given instance for which the prediction of the model changes.
The notebook contains one example using a very popular dataset called the iris dataset.
