                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wellbeing, life balance and mental health ressources are a huge issue at McGill.
Many students are thrown into their independent college lives lacking the ability have healthy lifestyle. Depression and anxiety can become outcome of this phenomena.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to implement an app that will help you through your difficult and happy phases or your uni life. The App is a Martlet that portrays your mood by analyzing your data. Afterwards, you can chat with your Martlet and ask for advice.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the backend on Java and then shifted to Android Studio to build the UI and put together all our code.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being 4 second year student, we only have a little coding experience. Although we had many ideas, we were very restricted and had to learn everything from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a first Hackathon, we are very proud to have finished the entire project. We learned to use many new tools and come up with an idea that also take into account social and ethical issues and create an application that functions.

                    We are highly motivated to continue this project.
