                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Live stream is a hot trend now. Everyone like to share their moment in life to other friends, and it make people come closer. In fact, people love to watch live stream in Facebook, more than normal video. But, Facebook live stream seem still so simple, not really attractive. Our company provide a live stream service, we help people to live stream on social network like Facebook, and our client want something more. They want a studio in their hand, they want to control everything in the live stream screen. And we make it happen. We worked hard and spend a lot of time to make that dream come true. It's GoStudio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facebook users are very active and creative, they made video content everyday, and now, they want to do the same with live stream.
What do you need if you want to use two cameras to live stream in an interview ? Hmm.. I may need 2 cameras - of course. Both connected to a PC to merge the signal from 2 cameras, a software to control everything and stream the video to Facebook. Oh.. And I may need a man to use that software, it's too difficult.
Yea,.. but with GoStudio, you only need 2 smartphone, or PC camera and one smartphone. To control which camera to go live, you just need few click.
GoStudio support many other cool features, to help you create your own show. Example, if you want to make a Quiz Game while live streaming, we got that. GoStudio help you to make a frame where you can ask people a question (the question show up in video live stream), and people answer you by comment. At the end, you can see how many people has right answer, how many wrong. And you know who is the fastest man with right answer. It really fun, you can take a look here :

                <p>
                    Not only game show, people can use GoStudio to create an online class, too. Let say a teacher want to do live stream. With GoStudio, their student, be able to make a video call or voice call to ask a question. Just by click a link. Or teacher can make a realtime poll. Students answer by comment and see the update realtime in live stream. All of these features to make a better communicate between teacher and student, livestreamer and watcher.
And for some one who selling something online, they will live GoStudio. GoStudio help you to build your own frame when livestream. You can put your brand there, so every one can see. You can make scrolling text, title, pin a comment inside the video while livestreaming. All features in this clip

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build web interface by PHP with Phalcon extension. And the backend is Python with some other softwares. We use WebRTC to send video data from client to server, process it and send it forward to Facebook. It seem so simple when you say it, but it's really hard in real-life :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first challenge is with WebRTC. We don't know how to capture the video data from client. You know, WebRTC is a p2p connection, client-to-client. And we don't really know how it works at that time. We tried many wrong ways to found the right one. And I realized that the right way is always there, I know about it, but it's the last thing I try :D
Then, I can captured the video, but another bug come out. Video and audio was not synchronize. I did some research and I see people said nothing we can do about that, just update browser to newest version and see if it gone. But, I see other sites can record video and audio just fine (Facebook and Youtube both have feature to live stream from PC camera, and video-audio synced). So I keep trying, to fix the bug. And lucky me, I found a way, again. To keep everything forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we never give up. While we're building this app, one member of my team wanted to leave. It was a difficult time, we're startup and we don't have much money. I know that I didn't pay him well, but there is no other way. So I talked with him. We talked about GoStudio, it's the unique software in the world, we're building something special and it'll be great one day. I didn't lie and he knew it. Then he decided to come back. And, together, we build GoStudio like today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now we understand so well about WebRTC technology, when an issue come, I know what to do, how to fix it. We learned how to run the company, and we'r still learning. For the first time we do startup, I think it's a little success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GoStudio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We still have many things to do with GoStudio. We need to build mobile app, too. So people easy to get live everywhere, everytime they want. We have to do marketing for the app, so we'll need money, we're looking for an investor. 
We're developing some other features like green screen, donation while livestream - and I hope Facebook will open their API of this part.
