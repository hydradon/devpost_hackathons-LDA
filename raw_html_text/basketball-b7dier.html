                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always loved basketball and I have been playing it since I was in third grade. I volunteered to show my webpage in the workshop, and it was ok but I know it wasn't my best work. I took that as a challenge and inspiration to work harder and perfect my own website.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you click on the top team logos, you will learn more about them and you can also look at the overall standings in the entire NBA. To top it all off, I have included some hilarious NBA memes. Overall, my website is put to update my viewers on the different basketball teams, and how they are doing compared to the others in the league.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built my webpage using html and css. I learned it in the workshop, and I thought it was extremely fascinating. I tried to add some extra features to my website by researching how to code certain objects (ie. how to put a back round color).

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges I ran into during this project was not understanding some of the code I was typing. I would type code for an hour straight but then not understand what I just typed. Also, sometimes after working for an extremely long time even if you miss one semi-colon it would not work. After that disappointment, you would have to go back to the entire code and see where you went wrong. Those parts were a challenge but it motivated me to work harder and make my website wonderful.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some accomplishments I am proud of was figuring out all of the code by myself, with minimal assistance. After the workshop, I thought I understood most of the code and wanted to continue for a really long time. Not once was I bored of what I was doing, because the more code I added, the more rewarding the outcome on the website was.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After only one hour of an html/css workshop I thought I understood all of the code. I also learned how to add cool features onto the code, which really enhanced my ideas towards my website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Basketball
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My basketball webpage is just a fun website to go on when you want to learn more about the different teams and want to laugh at the funny memes. My next step for this website is adding live scoreboards for games onto the website that, so viewers can watch live updates for all of the games, and not just one. These scoreboards will refresh automatically, so the viewers don't have to do it every five seconds.
