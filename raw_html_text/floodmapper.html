                <p>
                    Flash floods pose severe danger to human life. They affected 1.2 billion people in the last decade costed the world more than $12 Bn. In spite of its severity and frequency, flash floods are rarely predicted because our current water balance models riddled with uncertainty. On the other hand, data-driven approaches can be promising.

                    is a multiclass boosted near-real time flood mapping tool which takes into account multiple inputs and produce flood affected areas maps. 
The model runs on an
                    <code>
                        google earth engine
                    </code>
                    skeleton which ingests the latest backscatter images from Sentinel-1, land-surface reflectance from LandSat and precipitation data from point rain gauges. The output extent is then predicted using a multi-class boosted classification on RStudio. For quality control purposes, the flood extent is cropped to all regions with less than 5 degree slope (because of data limitation of backscatter). When compared with crowd-sourced information of flood occurrence during the flash floods in Venice, Italy on Oct 10 2018, the model showed an accuracy of 94%.
