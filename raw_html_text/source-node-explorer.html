                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interconnected map of the internet that demonstrated the vast resources available for use was the original inspiration. This made us want to create something that could help others better locate resources given any arbitrary starting point.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Source Node Explorer takes a article that the user has retrieved and attempts to find related materials that would be of interest or use to the user. For any material that the user expresses interest in, it can then recursively find more related material and expand into a vast network stemming from that original source.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using javascript, we constructed a framework that parsed strings representing the textual information stored within an article. We then used that information to create branches that spanned the tree of information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was difficulties parsing the data because of the many variation in citation method. Furthermore, the extraction of text from pdf returned symbols rather than conventional English characters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    We finished :) (kind of)
