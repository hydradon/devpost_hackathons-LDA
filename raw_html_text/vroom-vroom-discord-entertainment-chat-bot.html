                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Discord is a convenient online chat service that our whole group uses frequently. We were interested in their chat bots and enjoyed using bots created by other people. However, we were curious about the process of creating a bot, and wanted to customize a bot to do whatever we wanted. We were inspired by other bots we had come across online, and brainstormed some essential commands that we wanted our bot to have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our bot, Vroom Vroom Bot, is mainly a chatbot that detects certain prompts that are typed out by users inside the Discord server, and returns a response according to how we coded it. The prefix for our bot is V: and multiple commands can be called on our bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this bot using Python and the Discord API. We mainly coded within the IDLE python shell. We combined our knowledge from past Python experience, documentation, examples and various tutorials online to put together our bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, the biggest challenge for us was where to start. We didn't know what text editor to use, how Python syntax worked, or even how to get our bots online and responding to code. We asked for help from mentors, consulted online sources for explanations, and worked together to figure out how to start coding our bot. From there onward, we had to figure out the code that we needed to bring our ideas to life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of Python during this hackathon! For some of us, it was review, and for others, we started out with little to no experience with coding in general. We're proud of ourselves for pulling together in the end to make a fully functional, organized bot that doesn't crash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the power of friendship and meeting new friends through collaborating together for such a long period of time. We learned to get inspired by the people and environment around us, and strive for what we really wanted. We learned to be unafraid of asking for help, and to take all advice with an open mind and a grain of salt. Most importantly, we were able to take the first step in developing our own bot, and opening the door to the world of possibilities (and memes).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vroom Vroom - Discord Entertainment Chat Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue adding functions, although it may be on our own rather than in a group. We wish to extend Vroom Vroom Bot to have features like playing music, replying to conversations, etc. We also hope to learn more about bot designing and programming, much like robotics.
