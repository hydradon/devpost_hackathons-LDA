                <p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It should present opentreemap data along with inhalemap.com data, and reward users for planting trees in polluted areas.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio and StackOverflow.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Google Maps API turned out to be a pain to work  with for us, due to our lack of experience as well as the differences across versions. This was further compounded by attempting to get the current location.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's always more to learn, but be careful when picking up projects when the original creator is MIA and the technologies used are unfamiliar.
