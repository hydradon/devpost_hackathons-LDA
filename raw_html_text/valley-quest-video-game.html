                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we were all beginners and not that experienced in any coding language, we decided to make a video game on Alice 3. 3/4 of us had used Alice 3 in school so we were familiar with the basics but chose the challenge of making a first person shooter. We thought it would be a fun and cool idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the game, the player uses keys on the keyboard to move the 1st person camera through a forest canyon and take down some monsters on the wat to getting to the queen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Alice, we set procedures, variables, and event initializers to program different actions in the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to make the ogres move as the player would get within the designated distance of them, sometimes they would move toward you and sometimes they just wouldn't. We also struggled with working together because with Alice, you can not share it so we had to individually develop different parts teach the person with the official game how to do it to put it in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all happy to fully finish the game and be able to play it after. We all learned how to use some of the most complicated codes on Alice which was a challenge to make them work sometimes but we eventually figured it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how use many of the more complicated functions and codes in Alice and how to apply them into our video game.
                </p>

                    What's next for Valley Quest Video Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were to build off Valley Quest in the future, we could work on giving the ogres abilities making them harder to kill and make more levels and maps to play through.
