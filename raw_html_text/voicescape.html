                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Old School Runescape is a beautiful masterpiece of nostalgic perfection. Perfection has never been so perfect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This allows you to play Runescape via voice commands sent by a Google Assistant. This can be done from a phone, tablet, Google Home, or other smart device with access to the Google Assistant. Some commands include walking, turning, chopping trees, making fire, putting on armor, dancing, and speaking with others.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used IFTTT to connect the Google Assistant to a synced Dropbox folder on our local machine. We ran python scripts to take in the input from the Google Assistant stored in a file on Dropbox. We used pyautogui to interact with Runescape through keyboard and mouse commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The scripts took control. We fought a hard battle, and in the end the scripts basically still won. One of the scripts nearly deleted the entire project while not having any backups, but we came out with a finished project.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one of us knew Python. He mainly helped everyone, so the rest of the group members got a lot of practice with Python. Making a connection between a Google Home and a PC was very interesting and gave all of us ideas for future projects.
