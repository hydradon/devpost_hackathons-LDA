                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to an IPOS survey, only half of adults recycle daily... A staggering 13% of adults NEVER recycle and the most highly cited reason why they don't? It's because they don't know what is recyclable or not!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once, my dad tried to recycle a toaster!!! This is, of course, an extreme example, but many Americans don't know what is recyclable or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows us to train a k-nearest neighbor algorithm and distinguish what an item is based on simply computer vision. We will then be able to determine whether or not that item is recyclable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the brand-new Tensorflow JavaScript library that they recently released, which was a limiting factor since all the features have not been built out (in fact, they were still updating the documentation as of two days ago!! Which was kind of cool to be using something that is literally being developed in the moment) We used HTML+CSS+JavaScript to create the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -The features of the Tensorflow.js library have not been fully fleshed out so we weren't able to export the model we would develop after training it ourselves, meaning that it would have to stay on that webpage the entire time (if we refreshed the page on our local host, it would lose the trained model).
-Training your data yourself is long and somewhat boring
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -For everyone but one person on the team, it is their first hackathon... So being able to create this in your first hackathon is pretty dope. 
-The team was formed today and within less than 12 hours we became friends working on these projects
-Getting a functioning machine learning algorithm from a very undeveloped existing library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -How to collaborate quickly, how to rapidly iterate when a plan didn't go according like we had hoped.
                </p>
