                            AR CheatSheet - There were many... but the biggest challenge actually lead to the biggest breakthrough. Originally we expected the machine CAD to be available, but the manufacturer would not share the files due to IP concerns. Without access to the 3D data, we didn't have a way to map AR assets to real-world objects efficiently... we could use image or QR style triggers, but then we'd be backpedalling toward the sticky note problem we were trying to get away from. Ultimately, our lead developer (team member here Garrett Hoofman) had the epiphany that HoloLens included computer vision capabilities via an XBox Kinect camera system, which unlocked environment depth scanning functions. After testing a theory to confirm using the device to scan the room, including the machine, it allowed us to map the objects directly to a specific part with the least amount of friction. Moreover, it also allowed us to create a "Builder Mode," which can be used to program/customize the app to any machine or workflow on-the-fly directly in any environment.

                            Inspect &amp; Collect- There were many here too... mainly surrounding current limitations in computer vision based on environmental factors as well as user adoption and training hurdles for tool integration.  Moreover, deeper insight required regarding AI/IoT needs for pushing beyond AR for visualization into IoT/Smart Connected Operations and AI predictive-analytics.&nbsp;

                    For example:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Hololens 2 - provide a UX/UI with guides and inputs like current "AR Cheatsheet" + "Inspect &amp; Collect"; take photos when decision is made, archive them for analytics
2) Introduce AI where after we get X amount of data, use that data to program AI so it knows when a job is completed successfully and can validate the human choices through a process
3) Take the AI up a notch where after it has enough use cases, we flip roles with the worker and as he or she is going through the process the AI is watching and doing the verification... at this phase, the human would still have ability to validate and override the AIs decision. All the while the process is still being captured and archived providing rich and targeted fodder for algorithms because now we have the human expert validating the machine&rsquo;s decisions.&nbsp;
4) Install a system that overlays the "how-to" information so the worker is an expert from day one (AR CheatSheet)... and they go through executing their job function. The main difference now though is the user doesn&rsquo;t have to do paperwork at the end of a shift. Rather, while they are doing their work, they wear a device that toll gates process and measures success in real-time. The process is recorded (what was done? Was it done correctly?), cycle time measured, and any information regarding maintenance defects achieves a higher standard while process and efficiency increases. Moreover, Human performance data on the worker is measured and recorded so we know where gaps in training are or if that resource needs to be reassigned.
5) Finally an automated AI-driven robot approach is implemented where the human monitors the machine&rsquo;s performance and/or can take on other job functions...
