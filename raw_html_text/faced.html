                    At the moment, companies around the world are looking for new ways of securing accounts and payments . Passwords become more and more ineffective and everyone is looking for a solution to use instead of the classic PINs and passwords.
Biometric verification is the future and that's why we wanted to do something with face recognition.
Our plan was to log into an account from a page made by us using face recognition. However we did not achieve that. We ran into some problems :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        couldn't install openCV into our computers ( probably because we have windows) -  this step took us most of our time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        found out that it is quite difficult to link a button from a html page to a matlab project ( when clicking the button, the matlab project will open)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the matlab project takes time to run
-the face recognition thing needs some ort of level of light in order to work ( it will not work if there is poor light or too much light !)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We tried to implement biometric verification into simple html pages, but it was kind of difficult or maybe impossible.
However, we are proud of the fact that we made some code that works ! And it recognises your face! Also,it prints our 1 or 0 into a text file if it found a face or not( 1 if it found , or 0 if it didn't). 
 What we have learnt :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        to never use matlab to a hackathon
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        how face recognition works
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We are table number 13
                </p>
