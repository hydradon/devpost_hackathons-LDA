                </h2>
                <p>
                    High Marks takes any image with highlighted text, converts it into an editable text document, and organizes your highlighted content by color. Study better. Get High Marks!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Cloud Vision API to process the image, find the text, cut the text into single words to detect whether it is highlighted, and save the text accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever been to a hackathon or deployed a web application before, so starting the project was a huge obstacle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all demoed a project at our first hackathon! We also were able to push the capabilities of the vision API to use it for our purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Google's Cloud APIs and that it's really difficult to talk between the front and back ends of a website when you don't know how to create either.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for High Marks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is still a lot of work to do in creating a website that can actually interface with people, including actually deploying our web app.
