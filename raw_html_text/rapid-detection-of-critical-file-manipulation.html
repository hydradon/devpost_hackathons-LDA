                    In the past thirty-six hours I have crafted the base of a tool that can give you length in depth of correlation event information and nearly instant notification of critical file alterations. Searchable, rolling logs are capped according to the user or admin's specification, while alterations and additions of critical files are notified on the user's display, and texted to the cell number specified during setup within one minute.
