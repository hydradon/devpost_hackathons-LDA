                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are driven by the desire to help the homeless by addressing them on a personal level.  This idea inspired us to create a user friendly, personable application for the individuals in need.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gimme Shelter creates a database between the individuals in need of shelter and shelter providers.  From here, the person in need has the opportunity to reserve an available room for the night at a local shelter based on proximity, applicant qualifications and shelter preferences. Each time someone is checked in and out of a shelter, the information is recorded and stored in the database.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Bootstrap, Flask and MySQL.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a database for a web application was one of the most challenging things we ran into, other than previously having minimal knowledge of web development.

                <p>
                    Coming together as a group with a diverse educational background and competing in our first hackathon.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about databases, web development and homelessness.
                </p>

                    What's next for Gimme Shelter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the Hackathon, our group got a great start on our project. However, we still have a lot of ideas that we were unable to implement in the time given. This includes: partnering with food distributions, mental health care facilities and other benefits that homeless people can use. Another step we would try to take is to find a way to analyze all of the data stored on our database. We would focus specifically on the individuals who are going in and out of homelessness to find trends and possible underlying causes as to why the problem is reoccurring.
