                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our friends on the basketball team has color blindness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This codes identifies different or enhances certain colors within an image, so that people with different forms of color blindness are able to differentiate between differently colored aspects within the image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by translating java code unto object-c and then swift in order to create the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transcribing the code from one language to the other, as we had to restructure the algorithms with each translation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were successfully able to complete the app. In addition, we are proud of learning and using image processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The importance of the planning process, and the intricacies of image processing. `

                    What's next for HelpC
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To further diversify the pallet of colors it is able to recognize, and building a more accurate compare algorithm trained to find the 'same' colors within the image better.
