                    Raising people&rsquo; awareness on the topic of climate change and motivating the community to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle via gamification.
Inspiration:
Our own personal experiences inspired us to develop this project. We deeply care about the environment and we see others around us concerned about it too. However, when we initiate such dialogues on climate change, people feel confined in their abilities to make any change. Climate change is perceived as a big global issue and they feel they can't do anything to change that. 
Moreover, some think of climate change as a scientific myth as they don't see any real impact of it in their daily lives. Therefore, through the Climathon, we got together as a team to develop a gaming app to visually show the real impact of climate change and to engage players showing how they contribute to this cause by making slight changes in their daily activities.

                    Project Description:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EcoWarriors is a social challenge game challenge of raising virtual endangered wild animals to bring awareness and action toward climate change! The goal of the project is to engage people in changing their daily habits and adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. Every action of the users is tracked and converted to a score, the score will be the metrics for the wellbeing of their virtual pet. These actions include: Reducing carbon footprint using more renewable energy, wasting less water, reducing waste (i.e. Changing to reusable shopping bags), choosing businesses that support green living (partners), recycling, and biking instead of driving.
                </p>

                    Game Storyline:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The global climate change becomes a huge problem on Earth and numerous animals are on the edge of extinction. To prevent the mass extinction from happening, the players will act as a wild-lives rescuer and are assigned with a mysterious egg of an endangered animal. Each animal they are assigned will be the very last one of a species. The players will incubate the egg at the beginning stage of the game. After the players reach a certain score, the egg will reveal their assigned animal ( i.e. penguin, dolphin, whale, polar bear&hellip;) Depending on the player&rsquo;s choice of challenge, a set of tasks will be shown. The tasks are daily actions in a person&rsquo;s life, and every completed task will be tracked and converted to a score. That score will be the metrics (such as air quality, water quality, energy consumption&hellip;) that will contribute to the wellbeing of their virtual pet and the improvement of the environment in that animal&rsquo;s habitat. With a higher score level, the virtual animals will slowly bear more eggs and have a family of their own to bring their species out of extinction. The game raises people&rsquo;s awareness and educates about sustainable living in a fun way that even a kid can understand. EcoWarriors is a great game for individuals or for the whole family to play together.
