                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It came from thinking about how nice it would be to drive up to the Marriott, hold up your phone, and check in through a clean, easy to use AR interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested in creating a "point of sale" system that used AR with the Esri location data and Galileo for transactions. It create a dynamic floating 2d anchored in 3d space at the geo-location of each business. The 2d sprite(s) would be information about the business/monument/location and would allow you to scroll through reviews, make purchases, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't. It was way too far out of our current capabilities. We plan to continue on developing it and use it to help push our skills.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I personally ran into many issues with dynamic content on 2d Sprites. I wanted to add a scrollView to a 2d sprite and I haven't found an answer to that yet.

                <p>
                    That I'm still interested in coding after banging my head against documentation all night.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to create post/get request, create a mongo atlas bd, and create an RESTful API that allows for an external application to access the database.

                <p>
                    We are going to keep trucking away at it. Maybe finish it for next year's hack-the-u
