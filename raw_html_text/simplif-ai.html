                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most people have multiple Social Media Accounts that they are constantly checking throughout their day. Using Social Media seems intuitive to us because we use it so intensively every day. For Seniors and Disabled people, the lack of accessibility in Social Media will stop them from using these platforms. This problem was our inspiration to build simplif.ai.

                    Our solution, Simplif.ai
                    <strong>
                        consolidates social media data
                    </strong>
                    for seniors and the disabled who have difficulty staying connected with the world. Simplif.ai streamlines the
                    <strong>
                        user experience for accessibility
                    </strong>
                    .  The
                    <strong>
                        integrated chatbot
                    </strong>
                    (on Facebook Messenger) allows for users to read a
                    <strong>
                        custom summarized version of their activity
                    </strong>
                    on social media.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Chatbot using
                    <strong>
                        Azure&rsquo;s Bot Service API
                    </strong>
                    . Using this API gives us the ability to use
                    <strong>
                        CaptionBot
                    </strong>
                    , one of Microsoft&rsquo;s Cognitive Services. We are making use of API&rsquo;s from Social Media Companies such as
                    <strong>
                        Facebook&rsquo;s Graph API
                    </strong>
                    . We are also making use of smartphones
                    <strong>
                        text to speech
                    </strong>
                    ability to make this extremely accessible to our target audience.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We had difficulty implementing the authorization system in Facebook messenger. We also had difficulty with implementing Instagram and Twitter feeds inside of the messenger.

                <p>
                    We learned about
                    <strong>
                        implementing API's such as the CaptionBot
                    </strong>
                    . We learned on
                    <strong>
                        how to use LUIS
                    </strong>
                    to make a chatbot enabled with
                    <strong>
                        Natural Language Processing
                    </strong>
                    . Learned how to use the Azure Bot Framework. We learned how to work with
                    <strong>
                        Facebook's Graph Explorer
                    </strong>
                    and implementing its API.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make this accessible to a larger demographic. An example of how we can do this is implementing the
                    <strong>
                        IBM Watson Visual Recognition API for use of Sign Language
                    </strong>
                    inside of this bot. We also want to increase the range of social media platforms available on this bot.
