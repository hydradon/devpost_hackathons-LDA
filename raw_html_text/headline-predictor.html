                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were wondering wether we could use predictive models such as markov chains to predict future news, (and with that, the future!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The algorithm constructs a complete merged markov model of order n, by calculating and merging together the markov sub-chains generated from each individual training news header sentence

                <h2>
                    We made it using python and our general knowledge of Markov chain models
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We were planning on making it into a web app but due to node Js limitations we decided to pack it into a very compact python gui
