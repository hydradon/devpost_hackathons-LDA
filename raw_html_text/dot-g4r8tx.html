                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create awareness of sexual harassment and safe zones throughout the campus.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product is a web application that allows users to state if a certain location is a red dot (signifying not a safe zone) or a green dot(signifying a safe zone). And based on these inputs, a visual representation of it is placed throughout the map. It also allows the user to enter comments about that specific location thus adding a textual background to the visual representation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided the group into two distinct teams: front end and backend. The front end worked with html, css, and javascript to create the layout and format the web application. The back end, worked with javascript, API's, and databases to create the functionality of the app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to us all being first years and it being one of our first hackathons, it was a slow learning process as we knew only the basic of the basics of javascript, html, and css. As we laid our idea more clearly, we realized we will need to implement our own database through firebase to store and obtain various forms of data, however, none of us had any knowledge or skill in those fields so learning how to use it was quite frustrating as often time we were stuck at a particular problem.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was able to create a functional webpage through implementing various techniques for a sleek UI and create a functional database that is able to store the data from the application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a variety of technologies that enabled us to complete the Dot project. In addition, although we split up into two teams during the development process, we were all heavily involved with each other's affairs. We learned how to utilize Firebase in order to store data from a live interactive map, and how to implement the Google Maps API. We also strengthened our preexisting knowledge of web development by challenging ourselves to create new things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to be able to view comments for each and every red/green dot situation that happens around grounds, so as to better track dangerous situations. In addition, we would like to have a search functionality to search for locations so users can see a rating of how safe the general area is.
