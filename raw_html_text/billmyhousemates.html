                        &ldquo;credit&rdquo; is given to each housemate based on the expenses they logged in the billing period.

                    <li>
                        When a bill is due Each housemate&rsquo;s amount due is calculated: Credit is first used against the amount they owe.
If there is still credit remaining for a housemate, it carries over to the next billing period.
Each housemate receives an SMS with their own amount due, prompting them to pay.
They can reply OK to automatically transfer that amount from their Capital One account to the Household Account.
Once all housemates have transferred their portions for a Bill, the Household Account automatically transfers the total to the company.

                        The concept was conceived during a whiteboard session where we were discussing problems that people commonly have. The problem of communal payments when house sharing came up and we decided to run with the idea. Using the whiteboard we then planned the project by mapping out the problems and coming up with solutions to them and seeing where we would have a viable and unique product.

                    <li>
                        We then divided the project into separate areas such as client side, server side and the texting functionality.
