                <p>
                    Making sure that we understood directives correctly was critical due to the conversational nature of the application and the demand for Render-Templates on our Echo Show development.
Making sure that our selection of S3 and DynamoDB storage could scale to meet demand was tough, since we focused on preserving our innovative randomly generated interactions on complex configuration files.
English is not our native language so triggering the right Skill in echosim.io was quite funny and time-consuming at times.
