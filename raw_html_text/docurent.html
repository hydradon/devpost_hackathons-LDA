                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the fast growth of websites like Craigslist and other big social media sites such as facebook implementing online marketplaces, our group wanted to come up with a way for individuals to trade/rent items securely without having to rely purely on each others word.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows one to access an online marketplace for renting goods, where he/she can explore what kind of goods are available for rent (along with details such as rate,conditions), but also allows one to post their own goods they would like to rent out. For example, I select an item I would like to rent which sends info the the renter that I am interested and if both parties agree, the app creates a premade contract and uses DocuSign to sign the contract.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the mobile app and used firebase as our Database to essentially create the environment in which people can explore and rent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major problem was asynchronized tasks with java as we coded through android studio. It was also very challenging to navigate through the DocuSign API and documentation as there was not very much information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to code a much of our milestone such as the create and access items on a list by multiple people, create an account and save it on the database, and implementing DocuSign into our app in a short about of time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides learning a lot about android studio and setting up server databases and accessing them
It's difficult to build up an app from scratch with little to no organization and a tight time constraint
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DocuRent
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement a chatting/messenger system, a direct transaction method, rating system. However there are many optimization issues that we need to work on as accessing and pulling information takes a bit of time from the database
