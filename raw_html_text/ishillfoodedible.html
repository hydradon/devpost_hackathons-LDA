                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hill food is really not that edible, especially those from B-plate. However, the debate regarding whether hill food is edible goes on forever. So, I decided to settle this using Google's Natural language processing API.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gets dining hall menu data, feed it to Google API, and say whether it is edible or not!

                    How I built it

                    I literally built it in the last 30 minutes before submission
