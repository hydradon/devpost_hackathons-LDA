                    We were inspired by the idea of being poor college students and how we have been trying to get cheap furniture for our empty apartment. We have been usually getting it from the streets on garbage nights for free tables and a couch. We built the website using a database from MongoDB. Our biggest challenge was actually learning out to connect and retrieve data from a server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All login and account information is on the cloud as well as every simulated piece of furniture is on the server database.

                    Once you create an account the details go up to the cloud(MongoDB) and are stored there even after the page is closed/refreshed.
The system throws errors at you if you decide to log-in without entering a correct email/password so make sure you type carefully!
