                <p>
                    Since we are quite far in our bachelors degree of computer science we all have some ideas how to improve the life of a software engineer. And often it's one of the biggest issues to orient oneself in a new software project. So we want to tackle that  problem. We are trying to rethink the ways in which software projects are navigated and viewed.

                    Our Project ⊤.ology visualizes a Java software project with all the dependencies in a git repository. It shows who writes a lot of the important code of a class and other contributors, so a new developer can find the perfect contact person for a problem.

                <p>
                    The service is built on top of Spring Boot in a very extendable manner. The frontend code runs separately from the backend as visualizes interesting data about software projects in different manners.
