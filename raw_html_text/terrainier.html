                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always wondered how urban city planners were able to visualize the landscape of a city solely based on its 2D layout on a map. Moreover, it is difficult to plan for the future sustainably when we live in a world constantly plagued by climate change and global warming. Hence, we thought of making a tool which allows city planners to see part of the city in a 3D plane while also suggesting improvements based on real-time and historical weather data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a web dashboard which first allows the user to select the location they want to develop on the map. Then, they can generate a 3D mesh of the city tile and interact with it by viewing it from multiple angles. A plethora of useful charts forecasting the air pressure, wind speed, precipitation and temperature of the chosen location is displayed. The website even provides recommendations on what is the most optimal installation (either solar panels, trees, rainwater harvesters, or windmills) based on the weather data received about the chosen location. The user can also simulate how the particular installation would look in real life by placing 3D models of them in a 3D landscape of the city. It also provides the Return on Investment (ROI) and in how many years the investment would break-even which are important data for a government on a tight budget.

                    <li>
                        Used Google Maps JavaScript API to find the latitude and longitude of the marker dynamically as the user moved it on the map.

                        Used Google Maps Static API to capture a screenshot of the satellite image of the current map which is sent to the backend for image processing.

                    <li>
                        The satellite image is processed to identify the percentage of green signifying trees and the percentage of gray signifying roads and a ratio is calculated which is then used to recommend whether to plant trees or not.

                    <li>
                        We use a custom mesh analysis script and run it in the background with the open source 3D modelling software, blender, to analyze and mark all the building tops in a given area&rsquo;s mesh. Then calculations are done on these values to recommend whether to build solar panels/windmills/rainwater harvesters.

                        You can also place trees, solar panels, etc onto terrains onto a separate, distraction-free view and see the impact on the budget, as well as plan how many of each asset you need based on our suggestions. It also shows the ROI of the investment and break even point.

                            The land segmentation, powered by a large-scale Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model is able to predict fine-grained analysis of each and every pixel based on local features, i.e.,  what is near this pixel, as well as the features of the whole image. This hierarchy enabled by deep CNN makes the prediction highly accurate.
