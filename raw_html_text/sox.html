                    Inspiration
My inspiration is my parents and that section of society who want to enjoy the benefits of fast and rising technology. Our current project resolves 3 problems which commonly people face, namely- building websites from handmade drawing, job dashboards, and other small services and feedback providers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does
Our product is based on customer requirements. As per their requirements, we provide services like just draw and get the code, maintain job details and application to design the house. The products currently we have developed are:-
                </p>
                <p>
                    Realtime website generator
This generates a website source code either from a sketch or through webcam and is much faster than designing a website using wireframes and all such stuff. [Video excludes this service as we didn't ask for customer feedback upon this service].
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sharu and Jyoti
These services are for those who are handicapped. Such customers can avail of these services to have an improved customer experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vmail
This is an application that can be used by all customers to directly send emails using just their voice and not even a touch of the mouse is required. The source code is too simple just a few python files so that it can be used by developers as a package to integrate into their applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sox
This application is an offline e-commerce based application to mainly cherish the needs of those who live in areas of low internet availability or at times of natural calamities. In case of low network availability, the application is a PWA already has images that are classified using realtime object classifiers and then AMQ service is used to send fast messages. It received great customer feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traffene
The application is currently under development which uses RedHat Istio, Kubernetes and DataGrid to provide the best traffic management solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it
Initially, we focussed upon making the most important parts of the project that is using java and bash scripts to generate the code from the object dimensions and python scripts to deal with training our model. Hence, in this way, we completed the first part of making an automated front-end designer. Secondly, we made our basic project my second team member worked upon that. Firstly, I designed all the screens to have the best customer experience. Worked upon the backend so that for the time being we can demonstrate the working of our model. Implemented Redhat developer studio to develop our fuse integration project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into
Initially, we thought we won't be able to develop our project using a completely new platform and learning new tech stacks. But as we were working at least I thought that now I am a die-hard fan of the Red hat community. I want to become its member now and so I wanted to use almost all the tools. But then our main intention was to make something productive and we had less time so we are going to present our prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to work upon such a nice platform - Red Hat developer studio. Deploying our application upon openshift was another part of our interest. Then we even made another project and will integrate it soon using Quarkus and Kafka extensions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned
In short- "Customer is God". Making things at the hand of their tips and increasing the ease of using our applications is most important. For us to keep in mind that developers who will be working on our project after some time can feel comfortable using our code and so I used Quarkus for making the automatic preview of code. Especially Kafka's extensions are just awesome as we can easily add them in just a single line of command
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for CusX
We have a lot to work upon CusX. We need to add many such small but interesting free services. Our project upon automation of website building we need to implement Tensorflow.js so that we can develop code based upon real-time object detection.
