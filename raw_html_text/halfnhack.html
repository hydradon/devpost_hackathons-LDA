                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WE tech Alliance's challenge to develop tools to enable and empower the public to become more aware of the consequences of their actions (with respect to water.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our interactive allows the player to form water molecules using atoms, expanding to a wider and wider perspective until the water itself is consumed. Things start getting bigger, from an atom to the world, exploring how the world is crumbling fron the environmental changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game in Unity (2D) mode, and scripted in C#. The assets were made in GIMP and everything was locally developed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, coming up with a good idea. Then adding collisions, getting the items to interact properly and drawing quality assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finally getting the colliders to work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basics of game design, how to create item interactions and a little lesson in faucet proportionality ;)
                </p>

                    What's next for Small Things
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more endings, covering more complex issues, and showing the perspectives of people using water around the world.
