                    Automatically manages/spams course enroll requests at given time with an interval to the connectcarolina course registration system, so that you can finally steal all your precious courses you have always wanted from your fellow classmates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Potentially very useful for getting into that classes you have always wanted to be in. Turn on this tool all day, so you don't have to panic when Coursicle sends you an alert.

                <p>
                    Also potentially very useful as a semi-automatic DDoS attack to the rusty connectcarolina course registration system.

                    Honestly this is called HackNC so I really wish this is a real DDoS tool, oh well.
