                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am an avid fan of the game and sometimes cannot decide which character (a.k.a. god) to play, or get stuck in a rut playing the same characters.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program encourages players to broaden their god pool by randomly assigning them a god. However, it takes into account how skilled one is with said god as well as how often one plays the god. Gods who perform well and who the player enjoys playing get chosen more often. While, gods who perform poorly get chosen less often. The user is also encouraged to box the search by providing a class or role for the god.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I scraped data from Smite Guru, a website that keeps track of stats. From there, I performed a few algorithms to calculate the skill level and popularity of a character as well as the character's class.

                    Modify the algorithm slightly to put more weight on popularity.
Port program to a website for easy use.
Incorporate an offline mode.
