                <p>
                    There's so much knowledge that flows through and sits in our mailbox - articles, conversations, jargon-rich blurbs, meeting memos and links
                    <em>
                        (yes, we all know that coworker who sends us the "Check this out" email with a link - sometimes it's a useful article, other times is a cat video)
                    </em>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plus, there are hidden knowledge needs that get triggered in subtle ways - peers sharing buzzwords, bosses sending memos and development goals, job sites emailing new job postings and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's easy to get tangled in this plethora of information and the searches they spark - and end up in
                    <em>
                        a million
                    </em>
                    browser tabs, dodging promoted content and
                    <strong>
                        end up with hours of lost productive work-time

                        With Mya for Office365
                    </strong>
                    , we are introducing an Office365 Outlook add-in and OneNote+OneDrive integration (Office365 API) that knowledge-work super productive:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Convert articles, links, conversations - ANY email message - to a Mya checklist of concepts that you can research later, assign to peers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take notes of organizations, people and articles for future reference.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mya learns your knowledge tastes &amp; acumen - with the Outlook Add-in, you can peek into the contents of an email and see relevant insights (e.g. how conceptually relevant is the email to my current knowledge needs, am I an expert on the contents of the email and more)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With this project, we've also incorporated OneDrive and OneNote Office365 APIs to fetch relevant cloud assets for a user's Mya checklist - no more dancing between browser tabs or apps to find the right file at the right time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Powered by IBM Watson&trade; and our proprietary machine learning layer, Mya understands concepts and entities while organizing them into Smart Checklists&trade; just like a human assistant.
