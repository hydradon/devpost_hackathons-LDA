                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of my older brothers have had years of experience in the Computer Science and Design industries, and with those years of experience come acquired tastes. I found it particularly hard to shop for them during holidays and birthdays, so I conceived the idea of Wishlisty. A wish-list publishing platform aimed at design professionals and programmers. I'm hoping that people who visit the site are buying for someone in the industry, or are people in the industry themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the average visitor, it's a place to see what type of gear people in the industry are using for their profession. For the web administrator, it's a versatile product cataloguing and gift guide generating platform.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PHP for the backend development, with all the UI features supported by the Bootstrap framework. The main pages that people interact with were built with HTML, CSS, JQuery, and PHP with mentorship from my brother.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing the database to hold all the items. Creating a backend to make publishing wishlists easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very proud of the administrative tools I made for this project. I utilized the Amazon Product Advertising API to make cataloging products much easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a ton about PHP, which was use a lot for all of the database interactions. I also learned about using an API. In this case, I learned to read an XML response and translate it into data I could use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wishlisty
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keep on publishing Wishlists for certain design/programming professions.
