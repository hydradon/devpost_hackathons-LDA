                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to share all the joy we get from memes with all the other students around campus. We wanted to lift the spirits of students who have had a bad day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meme, Myself and I gives students the opportunity to enact the meme and feel the emotions that were trying to be conveyed by the creators of the memes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Meme, Myself and I through the use of Python. We used facial recognition and image comparison to determine if expressions were similar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Of the many challenges we ran into, some of the biggest ones would be cropping the picture to the face, detecting emotion and calculating SSIM values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make an accurate emotional recognition program. And we are first time hackers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about front end, through the use of HTML5. We also saw how difficult it would be to connect front-end to back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meme, Myself, and I
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although our project is currently in an incomplete state, our group found this experience to be a good stepping stone for further development in more deeper fields of computer science. Our next goal is Shark Tank, and then World Domination. And then a World Class Meme Monopoly.
