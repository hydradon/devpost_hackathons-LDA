                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Among Quizlet's other forms of using flash cards, we decided to explore auditory learning with them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choose and add Quizlet sets using a web application, where you tag them with keywords, and you can ask Alexa to read you one side of a card and have you decide which of two choices is the other side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided into two groups; one group dealt with the web app and one person dealt with interfacing with Alexa. The app group was responsible for a UI and uploading the flash card sets onto Firebase in a format usable for the Alexa team. The Alexa team was responsible for interpreting voice inputs, and using those inputs to access the different sets that were on Firebase. It took a lot of reading through the documentation, especially for the Alexa team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of our challenges were correctly interfacing with the Alexa, but there were also some issues in formatting data sent to Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack has two independent parts, separately designed, that work with each other very well and without issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest things we learned were interfacing with any variety of APIs, and the fact that even big companies have
                    <em>
                        very
                    </em>
                    accessible developer tools that anybody can use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Getting the webapp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Go to ajusa.github.io/Quizlexa/www/. For whatever reason, devpost thinks the link is invalid, so we added it here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quizlexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't know! Perhaps the ability to work through a set of cards at one time a bit more seamlessly, without having to worry about repeated questions. Also, we're excited to see if dynamic slots are something that Amazon adds to their Alexa API.
