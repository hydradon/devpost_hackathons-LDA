                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I (Souleiman) sometimes work in a chatroom where people stream their screens/webcams and try to work productively. It&rsquo;s really helpful for my productivity. Sometimes, people use another site that has a synced timer as well to schedule working/breaks. I thought that we could use Agora.io to combine the timer and streaming into one site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can create chatrooms, which have a synchronized timer for working purposes. They can see each others faces and talk using microphones.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used nodejs/expressjs as the server, and HTML/JS on the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not familiar with making node web apps so we had to learn that
Some difficulties with pm2, the node process manager
We had to set up Let&rsquo;s Encrypt HTTPS on the server, to run the web chat, which ate up some time
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a working chatroom!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web development experience
Basic deployment of a node app
Realizing that using express js is pretty simple, I (Souleiman) had come from a RoR set up which is less lean.
Experience with the Agora API

                <p>
                    Possibly tweaking up the experience, we have done some things that don&rsquo;t scale/aren&rsquo;t best practice.
