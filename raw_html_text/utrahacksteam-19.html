                    Our project is a food/cargo elevator designed to help people/ robots in these industries. The original design involved a camera which would be installed in every floor. The robot/person would stand on a specific spot in the camera&rsquo;s field of view indicating the floor that they wish to travel to. For example, a building with 3 floors would have three cameras and the camera on the first floor would have spots for the second and third floor. Thus, a person wanting to go to the second floor from the first floor would stand in the &ldquo;second floor spot&rdquo;. The algorithm for the elevator is optimized for efficiency and reduced wait times (minimizing unnecessary movement). The design would aid industries where a robot could move around with cargo in a warehouse for example and needed to go to the second floor. However, the robot has no means of communicating with the elevator directly. Thus, the robot can go up the floor.
