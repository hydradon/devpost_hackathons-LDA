                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we found that there are a lot of people who don't like to take medicine when they get sick, we think whether there might some other way to help these people. In traditional Chinese medicine, food is also a kind of medicine. There are some natural chemistries which can cure people's illness. Not only vitamin, but also some other chemistry can make people feel better. We believe that some food can replace medicine in some ways when people get ill. We won't try to say every pill can find its perfect substitutes. However, foods can help most of normal sickness. We believe that if you don't like pills, some fruit, vegetables,  can help you to go through uncomfortable time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the Dietment, users can take a photo or search in the search bar to what medicine he or she took. We recognize the picture though machine learning. In the function pages, Dietment will tell you medicine ingredient, a specific description, authority sources and what food you can take to make you feel better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use following techiques to build this project: Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Mysql, asp.net, c#, css3, html, javascript.
On the cloud platform, we use Azure Custom Vision Service to recognize the picture, and run the WebApp on to to provide the user service. On Google Cloud Platform, we use the SQL database and Virtual Machine to run our searching backend. We tried to use Storage or Blob Storage to store our picture, but we did not completely finish this part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team members are in different level of technology skills. We teach each other the tech that we know and use the new things in the project. The time is short, we could not make the project perfect. Time is the most challenging part for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that our design is actually works. This project can brings people better life. We are so excited that we can help people in this way. We show our passion on technology and helping people. The project is beautiful, we make it together. That's great!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each member in our team has learned different kind of things. For example, the Java guy start to learn C#. The guy who has never get in touch with database start to use MySQL. There are so many things that we learned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dietment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continues filling our database, to make it more and more accurate. We can also collaborate with some health companies to promote this project and let people really start to use it.
