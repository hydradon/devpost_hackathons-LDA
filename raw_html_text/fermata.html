                    We have so little time to reflect how we use our time and it would be amazing to know with a simple click what percentage of our time is used studying, or sleeping, or studying. Knowing these metrics doesn't fix anything, but it gives us perspective on how we each live our lives.

                    We are implementing a simple web application that categorizes how your time is used based on your google calendar. Knowing what percentage of your time is spent where provides perspective to all those who toil endlessly with minimal time for reflection.
