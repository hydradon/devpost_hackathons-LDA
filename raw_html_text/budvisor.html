                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meteor framework was chosen in order to minimize the setup time. The initial intention was to query the Nordea Open Banking API, but the idea was abandoned later for the reasons described in the next section. In the end we generated the transaction data ourselves to have it closely match the realistic spending behavior.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, having Node.js talk to the Open Banking API was nearly impossible and in the end we had to send requests through cURL. While Open Banking API is good for demonstrating how the whole thing works, the transaction data that we got back from it wasn't enough to make anything sensible. On top of that, it was absolutely random which made it hard to draw a parallel with the actual spending patterns (~10k transactions a month, ~7 payment destinations). For that reason we chose to simulate everything.
