                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are services that diagnose people's sicknesses, and there are services that refer patients to doctors. However, no service does both efficiently or smoothly, and it's a very important need that's not being met.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cura takes a user's insurance coverage information and combines it with a diagnosis it creates based on the user's symptoms of sickness. A host of the nearest relevant doctors for the patient to visit is then produced. From here, the user can view each doctor and their contact information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mapped symptoms of illnesses to particular illnesses. From there, we assigned doctors of a particular specialty to each illness. This then linked to a large, data-rich database of doctors in the US in order to complete the process from symptoms to doctor information. We basically integrated the doctors database with user information to produce the complete package.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding an API for a symptoms checker for patients was very tough, as a good one doesn't exist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is a very complete solution to a challenge that a lot of people face: finding a doctor that their insurance will cover who can cure their ailment. This is, in our opinion, a very useful solution and we're very proud about that. We're also proud of our team spirit and the way we worked together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the things we tried and turned out very successful was the use of online real-time collaboration in writing the source code. This is the best way to work together. One thing we could have done better was plan the specifics of the program logic and flow beforehand- something we'll work on for next time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cura
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to enhance Cura's personalization by allowing users to save and comment on the doctors they get referred to, both improving the quality of recommendations and the holistic user experience.
