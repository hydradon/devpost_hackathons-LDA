                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People continually bemoan that all politicians are the same, people who pay attention to politics get angry and say they aren't. This would be a way to answer one way or the other, at least as far as twitter is concerned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using scraped twitter histories of numerous political figures, we can train twitter bots. One comparison will be the bots vs the source material, and the other will be bots against each other and people will try to guess the source material
                </p>

                    Flask and heroku for the web application, a markov bot library for training of bots.

                    Learning points

                <p>
                    training twitter bots with RNN's are more fundamental, but haven't gotten quite turn key enough to learn in the course of 24 hours and then deploy. Markov chains  were chosen after 6 hours and progress had to be made.
