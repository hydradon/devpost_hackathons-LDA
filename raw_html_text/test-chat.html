                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jeremy Bloom's talk plus the experience of hundreds of awkward social conversations! The whole goal is to not hit the metaphorical wall in the conversation, which maybe due to a language barrier or not having anything to talk about. We want to eliminate that language barrier, help you learn another fellow Olympian's language and also know more about them, their countries and their cultures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a chat application exclusively for Olympians at LA2024. But it is more than that, because it has an in-built chat assistant called 'Olympia', whose sole purpose it is to help you have a great conversation. Olympia can help you translate sentences into any language you want, she can help you get news and trends that you might both be interested in, and also help you learn more about a new friend you just made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this as a web app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end and PHP for the back end. We used Microsoft's LUIS (Language Understanding Intelligent Service) to teach our assistant what kind of questions to expect. We used Bing Web Search API and Bing News Search API to help get answers for the user's questions. We also used the Microsoft Translator API to help break the language barrier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, trying to create a chat service of our own. Second, trying to integrate everything that we built as a team into a single project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building an actual chat bot assistant who answers specific questions that we want it to. That's so cool! Kind of like our own Cortana or Siri.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Microsoft Cognitive Services have some pretty cool APIs that can do some pretty cool stuff. Definitely will try them out more in the future.
                </p>
