                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create readUp from our own personal experiences - as young children, we were active participants in the King County Library System's Summer Reading Challenges, and we hoped to create a similar experience for young children in the modern age. Research has shown that the recommended reading time for beginners is 15-20 minutes a day, and that reading comprehension is a crucial skill for development and later success in life. Yet, this can be difficult to achieve in young readers who demonstrate little interest in reading. At readUp, we believe that reading can, and should, be fun. Through our online interactive reading tracker, we hope to promote and inspire literacy at a young age, setting children up for successful lifelong learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    readUp helps children and parents track their reading levels and stay active by encouraging daily reading (15 minutes). This makes reading fun, interactive, and helps children stay on track.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this web app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We used Adobe Photoshop and Sketchbook to create all of the graphics, and built the website from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges that we ran into included having a time crunch, grappling with the new technology, and learning how to adapt to these struggles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to create a fully functional website in the time given, and we think that the aesthetic appeal makes it fitting for children, our primary demographic. Additionally, we are proud that the website is dedicated to something that we are passionate about, which is literacy and education for all. We fully believe that this will encourage children to continue reading and enjoy learning about the world around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this entire experience, we learned about integrating many moving parts into one final product, especially as many of us were able to draw on our prior experience with art and computer programming to create our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for readUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add more levels, the ability to save user data, a login menu for parents to access their childrens' activity, and more interactive and fun features that give children even more incentive to continue reading!
