                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first night of the competition, we wound up talking to Sam Rebelsky about the experiences of a low income student in his MAP group from the past summer. The student faced social pressure to contribute money they didn't have to a gift for Sam or T-shirts. The conversation got us thinking about some of the difficulties faced by low-income students, which the majority of the student body might not be aware of. We wanted to create a project raised awareness about some of these challenges.

                    One feature of the Grinnell College experience is the Student Activity Fee, a fee which each student has to pay on a semesterly basis and goes towards student activities on campus, student publications, and running SGA. The fee was $225 in the fall of this year and is slated to increase for next year. We want to make sure that students know where their money is going and enable them to take advantage of events that they're paying for. Especially for students who don't have extra resources to spare and could probably use the money for other aspects of their life, we want to make the process more transparent and make sure they're getting their money's worth. We also want to encourage responsible spending by SGA and get the student body to engage with how their money is being spent.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives an interactive experience to understand the expenditures of the student activity fee on both an aggregate and individual level. Now, students can understand where their money is going and get involved to change the way their money is spent.

                        Did automated and manual cleaning of the data (see GitHub for R scripts)

                        The data from the SGA treasurer was very messy

                        We had to accommodate for ambiguous and conflicting data
