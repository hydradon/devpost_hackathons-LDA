                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People who have just begun living on their own, especially students, often have a difficult time paying attention to their diets. Diet is a very important part of overall health, and the first step to a proper diet is learning to cook. But what do I cook? What ingredients do I need to make a meal? What do I have to cook with already? These are the hoops many people think of before they give up on cooking altogether.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple kitchen is a mobile application that scans the ingredients on your countertop, names them, then searches a database of over 350,000 recipes to deliver you the meals you can make with only the items you already have! If there is not a recipe with only those ingredients, don't panic, Simple Kitchen will also provide recipes for dishes that contain your ingredients, and will show you those dishes in ascending order by the number of ingredients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using state of the art artificial intelligence systems, we are able to identify food ingredients in images, then based on the ingredient names the user accepts, we search a huge database of recipes to find the closest match to only the ingredients you have provided the system.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating an artificial intelligence system inside of a mobile application demands simplicity and accuracy. Designing a user experience to fit this model was extremely challenging.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we each had to learn a different aspect of iOS development in order to finish the project in time. None of us had much (if any) experience in mobile development. Trying something new turning out with a project like this is very rewarding.
                </p>

                    What's next for SimpleKitchen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SimpleKitchen would love to continue its effort by learning individual likes, dislikes, recommending healthy foods, and allowing a user to be tailored a balanced diet. We would also love to take the app from the kitchen to the grocery store, planning a shopping list for a week's worth of meals for our users, thus completing the circle from the cupboard to the kitchen to the grocery and back.
