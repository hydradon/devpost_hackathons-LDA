                    Growing up in multiple international surroundings, I have always been faced with the same struggle: inherent biases against unfamiliar cultures and nations. Never having been outside of Europe or North-America, I am filled with such biases. One way to change that: learn about their countries. Let's go, Alexa!

                <p>
                    The Alexa skill has a list of 'facts' which include an African country and the belonging capital city. By calling Alexa and asking her to open 'African countries and capitals', the user can ask for 'a country and a city', upon which Alexa responds with one of the random facts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was extremely surprised by how easy it is to build an Alexa skill - and I am eager to continue to do so!
Not having much previous knowledge at all, it was difficult to figure out where the bug was when I got stuck, but since the fact-skill I am using is quite simple and straightforward template filling.

                    Thanks so much!!
