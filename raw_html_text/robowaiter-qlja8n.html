                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having many bad experiences with waiters at restaurants that often spoil the customer's experience. We decided to fix this problem using technology and tools available to us such as google firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps people order at restaurants and avoid error in ordering the wrong item. And provides customers and the kitchen with real-time information about the orders.

                    We used firebase, javascript,html and css.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    The time was too little and we were too ambitious in our visions for this project. Also lack of experience was challenging.
