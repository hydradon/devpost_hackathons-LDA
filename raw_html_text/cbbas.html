                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CBBAS was inspired by our previous work with biomarkers in the human voice. With access to facial analysis tools from Microsoft, it was only natural to try to use this technology to find biomarkers as well
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an algorithm based on research into how facial asymmetries reflect deformities inside the brain, we created a tool that can assess the risk that an individual has autism just from a picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built CBBAS using Microsoft and Project Oxford's facial analysis software along with JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CBBAS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By making CBBAS more accessible and easy to use, and by improving it with new metrics, we can make a diagnostic tool that is accessible to everyone and can help end the social and medical issue of autism being a very underreported disease.
