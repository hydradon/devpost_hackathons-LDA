                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have this ever happened to you: Your remote control/electric toothbrush/mouse just died, so now you have a used battery. You know the battery is extremely harmful to the environment so you cannot just throw it away to a random trash can. You know you need to dispose of it at a spot that is especially for used batteries. You saw spots like this before. It is not necessarily a store, but just a special trash can. You were not sure if there is one near you.  You searched online but the results are a few recycling centers very far from you. You don&rsquo;t want to drive all the way there to throw away one battery. Well, that&rsquo;s what our Map is for. It helps you find locations, even the small ones, that you can dispose of e-waste, donating clothes, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows drop-off recycling boxes nearby users' current locations and tells what they are recycling. it is an interactive map where the user can not only find locations of different kind of spots (to dispose of batteries, donate clothing, etc) but also upload one location if he finds one. For example, you see a trash can for wasted battery on the street, then you can take a picture of it, open our app and upload it our map. (and maybe earn some points) In this way, our map becomes a platform that the user find/edit the locations of all kinds of recycling spots.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Map API, Google Place API, and Firebase. swift to build this.

                <p>
                    We know nothing about how to use an API and IOS development.
