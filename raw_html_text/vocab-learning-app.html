                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The existing vocab learning apps like Duolingo often lack effectiveness. A) They don't provide an effective method to ensure the learners to actually learn the words. They just kind of show "Hey, these are the words you need to learn"  B) They are often boring and learners won't stick to the app for long.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The game combines the Tower defence type of game with learning vocabulary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The app shows the concept of acquiring vocabulary words in a fun effortless way and provides a learning method which the results are measurable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is designed for people who want to learn new languages but are not motivated enough.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It makes the learning process much easier and much more effortless.

                    This main purpose of this app is simply to show the vision - where more complex educational games in the future can be built based on this concept and the learning process will hopefully no longer a challenge for anyone.
