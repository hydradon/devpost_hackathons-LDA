                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was playing a game similar to this on a website and thought this would be a great game to move to Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Guess the sound is a game where it plays three similar sounds and must guess option 1, 2, and or 3 which sound the skill is talking about.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm planning to add multiple language support, more multiple layer options and more diverse sounds for the skill.
