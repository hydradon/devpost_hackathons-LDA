                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Slack is a robust platform for communication so it is good environment to leverage for peer to peer payments since so many people are already on there communicating with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives Slack users the power of a DEX in Slack so they can remain productive and financially informed. Users can also exchange crypto directly with eachother simulating buying on platforms like Coinbase and Kraken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used the Interactive component and slash command modules in the Slack API to create at UI component for users to interact with remote Blockchains and services to do trading with Slack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Went through a maze of chrome tabs to learn about the SDKs offered by the companies here. I everything from missing dependencies to accidentally using the wrong version of the tutorial to get setup but I still perservered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never been to DeFi before, so I am very happy to have the opportunity to network with everyone at this event and have the opportunity to present an application to everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to the talks I learned a lot about new tools and frameworks in the Blockchain industry to make development easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SlackExchange
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After more testing I plan to publish on the Slack App marketplace.
