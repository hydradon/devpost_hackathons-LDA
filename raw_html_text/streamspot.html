                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us listen to Spotify or some other streaming service while working on our daily assignments. But when you remember that one song that you just need to hear right then, you have to hunt down the spotify tab among 100 other tabs. Where's the fun in that? That's why we created StreamSpot. All you gotta do is go to the omnibar, press 'S' (to invoke StreamSpot), type in the song name, and voila! We'll play the song and even add it to a playlist if you desire.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We covered it in the inspiration :/
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StreamSpot is running on Javascript mostly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spotify's API is not fully fleshed out when it comes to web apps. We had to write quite a lot of functions ourselves to make the playback smooth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished the app in time and we plan on putting it on the Chrome store very soon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StreamSpot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StreamSpot will be given some final touches and the polished version will be on the Chrome store pretty soon.
