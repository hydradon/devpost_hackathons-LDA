                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dataset itself inspired us to use machine learning
and NLP because it contained so much information hidden 
inside reviews written in human language. We hoped that 
trying different models would give us insights into how 
people encode their sentiments into their reviews, and 
that at least one model would give us a decent method
of predicting sentiment given a particular review.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our model uses Google's Word2Vec algorithm to first 
learn semantic information and context from the raw
reviews, and then vectorizes reviews using this learned
context. We treat these vectorized reviews as feature 
vectors that we augment with the other features in the
dataset, and then pass these feature vectors as training
data to different supervised learning algorithms such 
as LR, LDA, and neural nets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used scikit-learn for implementing the learning models,
and used gensim to implement Word2Vec by following the 
SkipGram-based implementation of the algorithm. After this
written, all we needed was to load and clean the data using 
Pandas and nltk, and pass this to the learning algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was the training time required to 
run all the different models we wanted to use to determine
which was the most accurate. The size of the dataset and the 
gensim library were also issues, as we needed a lot of space
to work with these locally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our implementation of Word2Vec, which seems to 
effectively learn semantic and contextual relationships between
keywords in the reviews. This allowed our models to predict star
ratings as effictively as they did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doing this taught us about the techniques being used in NLP and
sentiment analysis, and about which supervised learning algorithms
are the most effective given certain types of language data (by 
trying all the algorithms, we were able to get a sense of which 
was working the best with the type of data and the vectorization that 
we had).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Yelp Prediction Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would be to improve the NLP aspect of the project;
if we can more effectively analyze sentiment by better analyzing 
context in reviews, we would no doubt be able to improve our 
prediction accuracy. Given more training time, we also could 
experiment with more complex models to see how these perform 
on the dataset.
