                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scrolling through my Instagram and was irritated by how many people upload a image of the food they having at a restaurant or at home. I wanted to create something that lets them know of the health pro and cons of the food they eating.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Application that helps users select healthy food recipes based on the ingredients in the grocery cabinet

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used php and mysql to create this application. I used the source to image capabilities that the Openshift cloud service provides.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Still being new to Openshift, I had trouble getting started and ran into quite a few issues that affected my progress.
Linking databases in openshift to the web app.
Technical assistance
API's didn't work the way they should've.
