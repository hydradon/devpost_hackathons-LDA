                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was thinking about apps that have preached about productivity and healthy habits. However, usually, these apps generally just shoehorn the habit reinforcements in and do not really work. I wanted to make a habit changer that would genuinely work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a regular alarm clock, it wakes you up at the right times. However, you must prove that you are awake to the clock within a certain amount of time or serious consequences will happen. Right now, it only breaks the computer, however, I intended it to send emails and donate money if you don't wake up on time.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I coded a clock into my index with JavaScript, the design is HTML and CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My entire team quit like more than halfway through the hackathon. I had to can my original project and create a new one from scratch by myself because I didn't know how to implement the past project. I had to teach myself JavaScript, relearn CSS, devise my idea and code it in about eight hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the entire application, learning some JavaScript in such a small amount of time, creating something cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt how to use JavaScript and gotten more familiar with CSS. I also learnt the importance of proper sleep.

                <p>
                    Making the consequences of not getting up more severe. Adding more Kanye sounds.
