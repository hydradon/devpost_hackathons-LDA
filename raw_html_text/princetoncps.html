                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a tangible lack of concrete data to work with when it comes to mental health and wellbeing. We wanted to design a platform that would facilitate the most effective collection of information in long term. We also wanted our project to have a significant individual impact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We met with the office of Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) and proposed to them our idea: an app that asks a simple question to the user each time it is unlocked. These questions can range from things like &ldquo;Did you eat breakfast this morning?&rdquo; to &ldquo;How many times today have you felt lonely?&rdquo; This data is collected, analyzed and presented back to the user in the form of a graphical representation, and this smart feedback also suggests appropriate resources to help with trouble spots. The data collected will be encrypted and anonymously provided to CPS, including information about the user demographics to help them more accurately address and target their initiatives across campus.  Ultimately, this allows for Princeton students to anonymously send health and wellness data to CPS, which can then be used to provide better treatment. This information is collected from questions which the application presents periodically through a simple widget on the Android homescreen.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend runs Java with an SQLite database. The frontend runs Java with the Android SDK.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing consistent protocols to communicate with the client.
Designing and implementing the widget functionality was another obstacle.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our user interface (which successfully communicates with a server and database) was one of the first milestones in our project.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to work with the University&rsquo;s CPS to provide a quality application which students can trust to safeguard the data they submit, while allowing for members of CPS to access this information in anonymized aggregates.
