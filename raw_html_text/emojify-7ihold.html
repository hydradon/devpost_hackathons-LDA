                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine learning is cool!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It detects your facial expression and adds an emoji to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used machine learning with Scikit-learn as well as a training set of facial expressions to train the model. The model is then used to predict facial expressions, live, with the help of Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facial detection is sometimes quite slow. Also, originally the model was not good enough, until we decided to gather many datasets and combine them together.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first machine learning project!
                </p>

                    What's next for Emojify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to expand the emoji list to not only include faces, but to include other things like hand gestures etc. That would require a much bigger training set, though.
