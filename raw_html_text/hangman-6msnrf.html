                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make minesweeper, but that was boring and so we decided to make hangman instead.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simply simulates a game of hangman
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python.

                    Basically every part of the code.
