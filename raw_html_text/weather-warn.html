                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Amazon Echoes can do many things, but I was shocked to learn they did not provide watches and warnings for severe weather. As a meteorology I sought out to change this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Amazon Alexa provides current watches, warnings, and advisories when prompted by the user. The data comes straight from the National Weather Service and is updated about every 2-3 minutes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created the script in python and transferred it to Lambda to integrate it with Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since I had never used Lambda or much of Amazon web services, it was a challenge to get the script working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to prevail with my code in the end and test it out against various counties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about AWS and coding in general while enjoying the process.
                </p>

                    What's next for Weather Warn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps would to be integrate it with counties all over the US.
