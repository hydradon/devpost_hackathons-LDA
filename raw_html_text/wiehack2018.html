                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got inspired by the fact education is not only about academics i.e. what all is taught in our classrooms, apart from that our personality also plays a key role in building our career and prepares us as confident and bold interviewee. My personal experience is also attached as I was studious student of my class and because of lack of confidence, I face the fear of public speaking and present my ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our platform helps to do personality check-up by providing a random topic to the user to speak upon, leaving behind the fact whats the user's background is, he/she needs to speak confidently and with zeal. We've submitted a 100% working POC of the platform, since making a full production platform was not possible in such short duration of time. After every sentence spoken by the user, our model will do sentimental and emotional analysis. Also, it captures the facial expression and then convert it into greyscale with focus only in the face and doing the facial analysis of the user which will act as a confidence checker. Lastly the speech and facial analysis will be shown in the form of realtime graphs. And after the user ends speaking, it provides the overall report of the user.
In this way, parents and teachers will be able to know how a child is growing in terms of personality and can focus on that accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build our own machine learning model to do speech and facial analysis. We used reactJS as our frontend module and used different reusable components. python and TensorFlow for the our models. Flask for server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the Video analysis part was a bit difficult for us, but we finally came through it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By proposing this idea we were able to co-relate academic and personality development and have a knowledge expansion of Machine Learning.

                    What's next for InstaPersonalityScan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our future scope for this platform is firstly to overcome the challenges faced.
To enhance the speech-to-text analysis by involving pitch and tone analysis model.
To enhance the facial expression analysis by having the addition in model by behaviour and gestures analysis models.
Also, building the better report card with all possible things required
