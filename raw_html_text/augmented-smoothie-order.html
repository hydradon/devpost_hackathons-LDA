                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I get an order of a smoothie five days a week at 10 PM from Conversations back at Iowa State, and I thought it would be cool to augment that my pebble.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, all it does is log in the user by PC into their GET account and starts going through the steps to order the food by itself. I ran into some issue that prevented me from finishing the project, but I'll probably continue it in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used JavaScript and PhantomJs in Notepad++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I could not for the life of me get the program to alter a drop-down menu. I spent maybe six hours just on that one issue scouring the internet for a solution. Before that, I had a couple of smaller issues that I was able to resolve with the help of a mentor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first experience with JavaScript, which is a relatively easy language, but I'm still happy with how fast I picked it up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To try crazy ideas, but also ones that are within my current skill set. I got started late because the ideas that myself and Evan Timmons had were over our heads, so we split off into our own small projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Augmented Smoothie Order
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think it would be cool to create a simple android app that communicates with my pebble and uploads info from it to a server of some sort where it could be then accessed by a raspberry pi to do tasks like the one I was trying to accomplish. The possibilities are endless from that point on. I could control quite a bit from my watch, and I also think it would help me grow as a developer.
