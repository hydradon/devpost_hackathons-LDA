                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a decreasing availability of parking spaces and an increasing number of cars connected to the cloud, it only made sense to go for a platform that allows people to sell parking space to needy buyers for a short or long-term basis
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pulls different statistics from your connected car to allow you automatically unlock your car based on your phone's location. The client will login using a web app through Firebase to access the smartcar API. From there they can log in their car company's account and provide access to location and car info. This data will be pushed to Firebase and utilized by an Android app to determine if the car is in the parking space or not
                </p>
