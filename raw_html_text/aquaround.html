                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seafood is the largest source of animal protein in people&rsquo;s diets worldwide. By 2030, 62 percent of the world&rsquo;s seafood will be farm-raised to meet growing demand, according to a study by the World Bank. Consumption of fish from aquaculture is forecast to reach 93.6 million metric tons by 2030, nearly doubling the amount consumed in 2006. Early Mortality Syndrome and White Spot Syndrome Virus are just a few of the diseases shrimp can contract. Losses cost the shrimp sector billions of dollars and can decimate a farmer&rsquo;s livelihood. Preventative measures and rapid diagnosis are key to prevent the spread of viruses.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow shrimp farmers to collect environmental data with a microcontroller based sensor module and share farm conditions with others around the globe using built in bluetooth capabilities.
Notifications based on outbreaks of EMS and WSS in farms with similar conditions to the user.
User friendly interface.
Implement predictive algorithms based on Accuweather API and previous outbreaks of disease.
Use Google Maps API to display farms in relevant region.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used android studio for app development, arduino IDE for 101 microcontroller
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BLE integration was much more difficult than we imagined, and in general, we did not quite have the skillset necessary to accomplish our goal
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest stride we made was in getting the app to actually recognize and function with the arduino 101 via bluetooth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about android-studio programming, as well as gained a large understanding of BLE functionality and protocols although implementing them has been quite the challenge.
