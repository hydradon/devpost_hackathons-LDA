                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's common knowledge that regular physical activity is good for both the human body and mind. However, in today's world, finding physical activities in the local area can be quite daunting. Not only can navigating new spaces be a physical challenge, but if you don't know people in the local scene, getting a game started can be a major social challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We solved our problem by simplifying the process of finding someone with whom one could play a pickup game or participate in any other social and physical activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used data about the surrounding areas to show users what activities are in their region. With this view, they are able to see what activities are happening in the local parks and fitness centers. The option to filter the list will allow people with accessibility needs to seamlessly locate facilities that provide them with the services they require. Seeing all the activities will encourage users to try new things and connect with more people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used XCode to code in Swift and edit our MainStoryBoard.xml file (the front-end), and we stored all account and event information in tables on Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Git Merge conflicts were our biggest issue. Since we used XCode's Storyboarding feature, a lot of conflicting code was generated even when we were working on separate features. Dealing with the MainStoryBoard.xml file and searching for Git Conflict markers and coordinating merges took up a lot of our time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the Parse Database as a Service Application as we initially planned didn't work, We're not sure why it wasn't working, whether it was a bad install or bad configs. So, we decided to make the switch to FireBase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of having been able to migrate our code from Parse to Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of version control (Git) throughout the entirety of the application development process.
                </p>

                    What's next for SportsConnect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After any event, if members want to stay connected, they can buddy with them on SportsConnect to see any future events they'll go to. Ideally, these SportsBuddies will be a positive feedback loop for each other, helping them develop better fitness and health habits as they grow together.
