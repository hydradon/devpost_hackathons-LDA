                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often times, I would find myself lost at Wal-Mart. I wonder if I can build a solution that can help other to avoid the same situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the store to save the locations of specific products and allows users to get such product's location easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application was built using Java and calls Wal-Mart's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a bit trouble to get images into the application. In the end, we decided that the low resolution nature of the images that Wal-Mart provided fails to warrant the sacrifice in performance that we will be taking in order to have them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build a demo that is relatively light-weight and perfectly functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learn how to call APIs and parse their results.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I hope to have the chance to create a mobile app that customers can use in store.
