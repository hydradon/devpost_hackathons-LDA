                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Far too many times, people feel constrained to a political party associated with a set of resolute views. This interferes with the voting process as voters may vote based on partisanship rather than a politician's actual platform. The purpose of our web application is to match people with a politician based on their political beliefs rather than their political affiliation. Upon entering the website, the user is prompted to take a quiz answering questions that determine their opinions on certain polarized stances. An algorithm we&rsquo;ve created then takes their opinions and finds the most compatible candidate to them. Thus, they find a candidate not necessarily associated with party, but with belief.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This web application takes users through a set of questions to determine a user's "political personality." Upon hitting submit, the user's answers are passed through a match algorithm that pairs a user to their appropriate political candidate for matching.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this use the Java EE developer tools on Eclipse. We used Java servlets, JSP pages, and a POJOs. The servlets and JSP pages communicate via AJAX calls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Tomcat server fell... multiple times. This cost us a number hours trying to repair our web application deployment. It was also three of our members' first time using Java Servlets, and two of us had little experience with HTML. This was three of our members' first web application ever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we were able to network our servlets and run our application. It was also cool to implement Question.java class to pass data client-side to the back-end and run our algorithm to generate the appropriate politician for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every member of this team was a novice going into this Hackathon. Thus, there was a lot to be learned and a lot to discover. We all came into this Hackathon knowing back-end well, but the biggest trouble we ran into was connecting the back-end to the front-end. However, with a little help from stackOverFlow and Google, we collectively learned the process in which connecting front-end and back-end is achieved.

                <p>
                    We are planning on adding a crowd-sourcing function where users are allowed to &ldquo;evaluate&rdquo; candidates, answering questions that demonstrate how the given candidate&rsquo;s beliefs are perceived. Though there are websites that list candidates&rsquo; beliefs, PACs contributions, etc., these APIs are limited. Thus, in order to expand the scope and accuracy of our web application, we will add this crowd-sourcing function called evaluate.
