                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too many times have we browsed the internet or done unproductive things when instead, we should have been studying for a coming-up exam or working on an important school project. That's where StudyHack comes in. StudyHack _ forces _ the user to be productive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Chrome extension injects study questions on unproductive pages. You can't view the page until you answer a question correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazingly, only knowledge of JavaScript and HTML is necessary to build a Chrome extension. Google's documentation provided excellent help on how to get started developing for the Chrome browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into some issues with CSS but was able to overcome (most of) them through use of the magical Internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had no idea what project I wanted to work on at the beginning of the event, and I thought up this idea halfway through the night. I am proud to say that I _ actually _ completed a project at my first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to make a Chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StudyHack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's _ a lot _ of things I I didn't complete. Right now, the project only consists of two questions, and some functionalities need to be fixed. As of now, the user can't select what websites to block. It only goes into effect for reddit, Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and even then the overlay can get confused with the original website's CSS and HTML. So, in the future, I hope to improve and expand upon StudyHack.
