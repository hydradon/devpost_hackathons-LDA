                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After crises like natural disasters, political unrest, or acts of terror, the region can become a hotzone of danger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea behind TB is to use the bluetooth capabilities of a drone to fly into hotzones to communicate with people who are in need of help. For example, in a hurricane, it's difficult for a human to perform search and rescue as many places are hard to get to. However, using this app, the drone will go into danger zones first and inform responders where victims are, allowing them to send help more quickly and effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Reactjs and the Google Maps API to build the front end which displays the data sent from the server. The UUID(Universal Unique Identifier) of each detected bluetooth device is shown as well as the GPS coordinates of the drone when the bluetooth signal is detected. The client for the drone uses Noble, a Node.js library for bluetooth, to scan for and get information on the device. Then, the drone client will send the data collected to another Node.js server which will send the data to the first responder's central hub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time using React as a front-end templating framework as well as the Google Maps API. In comparison to VueJS, React does not provide as much control over your application. The Google Maps API, in particular, was difficult to work with because there was a lot of things you couldn't do to customize it. Furthermore, I worked on this project alone for the entirety of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of being able to create the three main components needed to relay messages from the drone, to the server, to the first responders, within the 24 hours allotted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Work with languages you're familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TB
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use data received from the drone to determine the priority of people in need by processing comments and looking for key words that would make a crisis more or less severe in order to help those in dire need first.
