                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the ability to use scraping and Amazon Alexa to build something that will make the campus meal searching easier to anyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program informs the user about the campus cafeteria menus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to scrape the data from the MSU cafeteria website. We then built a data set and incorporated it into the developer console for Amazon Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty formatting the data into our data set.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our largest accomplishment is that we all learned a great amount this weekend and we were able to make something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to scrape and how to use Node.js within the Amazon Alexa developer console
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MSU Cafeteria Search
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we will add more features like hours of operation, nutrition information, and meal search.
