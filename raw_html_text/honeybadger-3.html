                    Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are building a web app called

                    Executive Summary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When presented the main issue of the producing a software that solves issues for four target groups, due to the time and knowledge constraint of the challenge it appears wise to focus first on one target group and if completed, expand to the different groups and that, is the approach that was taken for this challenge. The idea being developed looks at the issue from a farm owner's&rsquo; perspective, and addresses the challenge to collect data by Crew Leaders, on a daily basis for making adjustments on the farm and at the same time develop performance or efficiency charts where it can be easily identified where the issues are. By doing so another aspect that is being addressed is the issue of not being able to see the farm workers on the terrain at a direct line of sight, have better supervision and accessibility for checkups on them for their health and security. The idea is to create a web based application that will track the movement and location of the workers on an agreed time interval and the tracking will only be occurring on the work hour periods and the time periods cannot be rearranged without previous consent of both parties, also it will give more accessibility and communication between the worker and leaders. It will be a positive aspect where the worker has the support of his supervisors in case of an emergency due to dangers and accidents in the workplace.
