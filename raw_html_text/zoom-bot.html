                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a TA at UCF for Computer Science I, and I wanted to try to learn how to make a basic bot on Discord. So I decided I would make one that would be able to tell you who is holding office hours for the class at either the current time or a specified day and time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the command
                    <code>
                        !cave now
                    </code>
                    the bot will tell you who is currently holding office hours, or you can use
                    <code>
                        !cave &lt;day&gt; &lt;time&gt;
                    </code>
                    to find out who has hours on a specific day of the week at a specific time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Discord reworked API for Python in order to send messages and scan messages sent.
