                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used to play this game since we were children and when we used to only play with cards
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is a simple one where the alphabet is chosen randomly and the players will get a certain time in which they have to fill Name, Place, Animal and Thing. At the end of the timer the form will be automatically submitted and score is calculated for each round. If two users have the same value they will get half points otherwise they get full points.
                </p>
