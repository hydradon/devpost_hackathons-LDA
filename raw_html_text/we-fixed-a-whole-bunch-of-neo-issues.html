                </h2>
                <p>
                    The open source contributions we made to the Neo repositories made them a tiny bit more polished and less buggy. The VM wrapper we worked on allows Elixir to access Neo VM methods normally only accessible from neo-python or the official neo C# implementation. Writing this VM wrapper should someday allow more advanced functionality in neo-scan.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Elixir is a

                        VERY

                    functional language that not a lot of people use and the python implementation of the Neo VM is completely object-oriented. Writing a wrapper between the two requires quite a bit of tedious type encoding.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our Pull Requests are super professional. We ran linters, followed tab/space conventions, used the most up-to-date technologies (such as async/await), and tested our code thoroughly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working so closely with large-scale blockchain code really helped us understand how blockchain works in practice. Dealing with smaller repositories in the past had only given us a thin understanding of distributed computing. However, working with so many different Neo repositories gave us practical, first-hand experience. Also, in our attempts to create neat, clean code, we learned about Elixir, code standards, Electron, and, most importantly, how to fix Git disasters.
