                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parents around the world actively decide to send their children to work or tend to the house instead of attending school.  Why not help these needy families out while staying in touch?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teachers, administrators or social development staff go around to classrooms finding out students' personal needs.  Their families may not be able to make ends meet, and need food, clothing or medicine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This inventory of needs is published to our app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We show future donors one child a day, everyday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a donor helps sponsor a child, they'll be able to stay connected with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Administrators make sure that these donations fulfill their needs and can share updates through the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These updates can include how long the child has stayed in attendance, milestones and pictures or videos of donations in action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sponsors receive notifications on the students they're helping out closing the feedback loop, and see the impact of their contribution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team iterated over the design through debate and research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then identified a user flow that made the most sense within the timeframe of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developers coded the backend and database schema while designers created a workable prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The two toughest parts of the project were 1) coming up with a feasible product with well designed feedback loops and 2) keeping it simple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team actually spent a lot of time putting ideas out on the table, mashing them up, and testing them.  We were all passionate about our own ideas but eventually managed to reduce the size of the problem and the size of the solution.  This was the most rewarding part for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting feedback from a variety of perspectives early can be a great way of figuring out product solutions.  Its easier said than done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EduKid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gauging the interest of educators, administrators and social development staff and figuring out where exactly this app could be piloted.
