                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Remember that 90's computer game where you had to guess where all the pesky little mines were? Well we want to bring that back, but in a much more real way.
The presence of landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) is a global issue that affects many countries across the world. Here's some trivia for you: building a landmine costs only $3-$30, but disposing it can cost up to $1000.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So naturally we started thinking about how much it would actually cost to build an efficient landmine detection ecosystem using IoT that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        minimizes human involvement,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        has a high detection rate,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        can be easily deployed on the field,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        uses lightweight equipment that won't trigger explosives,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        uses cheap sensors
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    ...and it turns out it really wouldn't cost a lot.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project Minesweeper uses lightweight programmable robots to 'sweep' areas prone to landmines. These bots collect real-time sensor data to infer possible threats using ML and alert the relevant authorities so they can properly neutralize them.

                    How I plan to build it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To test out the idea, we will use Anki's programmable robot: Vector and try to retrofit it with some cool new sensors that help us detect large suspicious objects and classify them. We will also attempt to build a
                    <strong>
                        Mission Control
                    </strong>
                    IoT dashboard that displays location data in real-time.
