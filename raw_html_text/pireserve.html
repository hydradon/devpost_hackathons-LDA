                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a previous study group app we made, and we thought that letting students reserve rooms through an easy to use system would help out students who wanted to study together in a campus building or library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to setup a reservation system for rooms using only a raspberry pi and a touch screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built in C# and UWP, and ran on Windows 10 IOT core.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came into this contest knowing nothing about raspberry pis, so it was pretty challenging to try and figure it out and create an application in only 24 hours. One big challenge was the screen. It wasn't built for windows, and the drivers are all written for linux. The screen didn't work without additional setup in the config file, and the touchscreen doesnt work at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we managed to get a pi running our own program with zero experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the raspberry pi and how to load our programs onto it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next is setting up a system to store all of this information in a database.
