                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sounds fun to me create a game like Master Mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can play Master Mind (with a JSON client) in follow address:
                    <a href="http://gringo.purplebox.com.br:8080/MasterMindWS/rs/bot/chat/YourName" rel="nofollow">
                        http://gringo.purplebox.com.br:8080/MasterMindWS/rs/bot/chat/YourName
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a server application with 2 JSON services endpoints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first is Master Mind Game where you can consume the functions to play Master Mind in single player or multiplayer mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second endpoint is a chat service meet by 2 bots, Marvin (from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) and Bender (from Futurama). They are not the best example of happiness and good education but you can have a nice talk with then. They also can help you playing Master Mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main idea was to create a Android app to consume that services but I had not time. Sorry for that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The run's over java 8, Jboss Wildlfy 8 and mongo 2. You need to add a folder called org (sent in submission) in wildlfy modules folder. Then you need to create a database on mongo called axionzenmastermind and an user for that database called axionzenmastermind with password axionzenmastermind (safety first).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Open the project on Eclipse and let Maven do the build.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The time was my main challenge. I would love to able to create all functions that I but unfortunally 2 day was not enough. Create the multiplayer mode let me think a little moore but it wasn't very hard.

                <p>
                    Well, I'm proud to make my first multiplayer game and to make a nice bot talking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that automated attendant is more complex than looks like and I need to learn a easier way to create web applications (Java web is too complex for that simple task)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Well if I had time would be amazing to have an Android/iOS app to consume the Master Mind and Chat Bot services.
