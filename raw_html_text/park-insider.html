                    Parking payment fine
Finding a parking space in Berlin is a task in itself. But the real pain starts later. Predicting the time that you will be parked for, per-paying for the spot at the parking meter and extending your ticket if you exceed the time is a hassle.
We aim to provide an efficient parking payment solution with Parking Insider.
