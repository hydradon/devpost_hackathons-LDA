                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services&rsquo; Value-Based Purchasing Program emphasizes patient satisfaction scores by factoring them into reimbursement formulas. Hospitals across the country struggle greatly with a category known as &ldquo;discharge information&rdquo;. Hospitals have implemented many tools that focus on providing information to patients through live coaching sessions, folders filled with pamphlets, and limited interactions following episodes of care. Not many entities have found success with these limited solutions. Patients and family members struggle to remember the swarm of information surrounding them during a hospital stay or following a surgical procedure. Providers need a comprehensive solution that interact with and educate patients in order to ensure that &ldquo;discharge information&rdquo; permeates life after their acute episodes of care
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patients fail to comply with discharge orders for a number of reasons. Doctors do not always have a full understanding of their patients&rsquo; lifestyles and patients do not always understand what is at stake (risk/reward) when weighing lifestyle choices particularly following acute medical interventions.  We are developing a platform that will solicit feedback from patients upon discharge from the hospital and prior to scheduled procedures.  Simple surveys are designed to increase each patient&rsquo;s health literacy and to determine if the patient is complying with both pre- and post- operative orders.  Based off the responses, hospitals can determine if a patient is non-compliant and intervene appropriately if necessary. Personalized, automated messages will be sent to patients through text message, email, or push notification when a new communication is available.  More in-depth surveys that contain specific patient information will be completed through a browser or a native application.  The web and native applications will be secured with password protection and message retraction to ensure HIPAA compliance.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PHP/MySQL app connected to Twilio for final delivery of the text messages.  Our code is being hosted in Azure.  Our landing page is material design lite site connected to Firebase to store the inputs from the form.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jonathan: Understanding the problem of readmission of recently discharged patients and why it actually matters to hospitals.  Then we researched what existing solutions exist on the market and trials that have been done in the past to address the issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sam: The easy part is thinking of what I want to see in my hospital. The challenge is expanding the design to be simple, functional, and attractive to provider organizations of all kinds without getting too far ahead of developmental capability in early stages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jonathan: First time I have ever worked on a business plan.  The plan really helped us gather our thoughts for our idea and put some structure around it.  Also we created a simple light weight landing page for our business that we open sourced.  Hopefully it helps another business that needs a simple website for their MVP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sam: This was my first true attempt at early stage design and really considering the capabilities we have at our disposal. I'm proud of the collaboration we continue to build upon and the things each of us has learned in the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jonathan: What it takes to actually build a HIPAA compliant platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sam: The challenges around design and development. More complex and fluid than previously thought!

                <p>
                    Finish developing the product so that it can be HIPAA compliant, integrate into an EHR, and get business associate agreements drawn up for our business.  We will then use our network of health administrators to find an organization needing solutions and establish a partnership in order to provide proof of concept and begin showing evidence and data that backs up our claims.
