                    Maker is the largest credit creation facility on the Ethereum mainnet. Unlike mature credit markets, Maker users cannot trade credit risk associated with specific loans and borrowers. CDP CDS allows two parties to trustlessly buy and sell protection on liquidations/undercollateralizations of specific CDPs. The project was built using Solidity. The key challenge was getting in-contract information on liquidation (bite) transaction from Maker DAO. Next, we plan to figure out a way to get default information from Maker and implement a front-end for users to interact with the contract.
