                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asian restaurants have massive, unwieldy menus that take hours to comb through. How is this so inefficient? What should I eat?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why do Yelp, Google Reviews, and all other food review places include poor ratings because of service? What if I only care about how the food tastes (since I'm already in the restaurant)?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    Scan menu and identify word chunks in real-time.
User can select a chunk and then select specific keywords that corresponded to the dish
Based on the keywords, user can rate the dish/food-stuff

                    ML implementation that is not shown in this codebase was particularly difficult to work with

                    Develop Android application

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of first times learning complex Android, so turned to many tutorials and read through a lot of what goes into Google's OCR. Also tried many different Google Cloud products to understand how each could fit into project later.

                    What's next for Food Menu Keyword Indexer for Better Recommendations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Train better ML model in order to have accurate recommendations like Amazon's "Customers who bought this item also..." or "Recommended based on your (eating habits)"
Fully flush out back-end server-side work, which was not entirely functional and therefore not included
