                    Over the course of the last year, I have shifted towards an almost vegan diet. My food cost has gone down tremendously and I feel significantly more energetic than before. I have become very aware about the plastic waste I produce and have unintentionally trained myself to feel guilty about it. I am reminded about the damaging effects of waste on our environment and the beautiful organisms that live in symbiosis from the time I purchase an environmentally harmful product till the point I throw it away. My family used to take extra plastic bags from grocery stores to save money on garbage bags like many other Indian families living in the U.S. and thinking back, I can affirm that we made a huge contribution to the global epidemic of climate change and violation of animal rights.
The android mobile application allows the user to scan various types of bar codes to identify products. Once the product is identified, the user can enter a quality and submit to save the quality and date of entry. In the case where the item does not have a bar code, information about it may be added manually as well. User will be provided with a table of items with some relevant information and option to mark the item as finished or wasted. The dashboard page provides critical information on the user's food usage, including statistics about their food wastage. To expand the application, a social network can be built in which participants may compete against each other to see who can reduce their waste to zero. 
I was not at all familiar with mobile development before coming to Girl Hacks and was originally planning to utilize my familiarity with the .Net Framework, Microsoft SQL Server and Angular to build a web application. However, since I've been using those technologies for almost the last 10 months at my internship, I decided to take on the challenge of learn a new platform.
I ran into many challenges from the time that the Girl Hacks started till the moment I wrote my last line of code. Successfully installing the different components required and configuring them was definitely a challenge. The task of familiarizing myself with the APIs that exist for interacting the phone's camera and storage came with it's own difficulty. 
I was able to successfully invoke the camera app to take a picture. I was also able to process images of bar codes and QR codes and decode the data.
I was able to get started on the project and get familiar with Android Studio. I am slightly more familiar with mobile development.
Whenever I have some extra time, I plan to actively develop this project to completely meet the requirements I stated above.
