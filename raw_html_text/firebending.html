                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a video feed from your webcam and shows you video that looks like you are firebending.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java and JavaCV. After reading from the webcam, we just worked with the pixels in a BufferedImage.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Figuring out how to detect a human in an image.
Simulating realistic looking fire.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Image processing is extremely difficult, but really interesting.

                    What's next for Firebending
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More accurate vertices on the human, and more accurate looking fire.
