                    What's Lookout?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The number one challenge of living in the modern world is information overload, and keeping track of everything is no trivial task. Context switching between what is currently on your screen and any sort of organizational app is distracting and time consuming (think about accidentally flying three desktops over!). Often the distraction of noting down future plans is more than that of the text or phone call that notified you of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Lookout
                    </strong>
                    is a
                    <em>
                        lightweight
                    </em>
                    app that combines Notes and Calendar for rapid access to the most pertinent information in a glance. It provides three scratchpads to drop idle thoughts and to-dos in a snap, titling each one of them like the Notes app by taking the first two words of the note. It also provides three quick views of your calendar: two days, two weeks, and two months, displaying only non recurring events to cull out some of the noise and bring focus to the out of the ordinary. Because it lives in the status bar, it is accessible from all desktops and full-screened applications, and therefore lightning fast to both pull up and tuck away.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Additional Features
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The rich text format of the scratchpads can be exported as RTF files for convenience. It also saves the scratchpads to an intermediary file, in case of unexpected system crashes or other unexpected issues. Because of the light-weight, glance-like nature of Lookout, rather than allowing calendar events to be added in the app, command and click to open Calendar for extended interaction.

                <p>
                    I would like to extend my thanks to the Apple engineers who critiqued the UI and usability of my app as I worked. It was important for me that my app was aesthetically pleasing and made sense to others as well, so that it would not be a tool that only I could take advantage of.
