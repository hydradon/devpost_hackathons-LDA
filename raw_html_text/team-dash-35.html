                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An artificial eye for people who are blind, it allows the blind to see using computer vision. We believe given current technology, betters forms of assistive technology need to be made.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses a live video feed from an available camera to detect obstacles in a persons way and alert them of said obstacles
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized AWS and the OpenCV library to grab live video from a connected webcam, convert it to words based on directional locations of identified objects, and send that text to a text-to-speech interpreter that relays the information to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the camera connected to the text-to-speech program and integrating a convolutional neural network to pick out objects from the video
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the program to pick out obstacles and say where they were located
                </p>
