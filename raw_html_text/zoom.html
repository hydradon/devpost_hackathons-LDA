                    We wished to help those who felt they were in a dangerous situation, such as the woman who felt endangered by a blind date that could go wrong, or the drunk who could have easily been taken advantage of or have gotten in a drunk car accident, or simply a person who needed someone to talk to in hard times. We wanted to make sure that our app would not take too much time to use, thus possibly arousing the suspicion of others. ## Inspiration
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user adds contacts that they trust into the app so in unfortunate situations, they can immediately contact them without the hassle of calling or writing a message. Three options are available for the convenience of the user and the receiver: I need a ride, I need a friend, and I need to leave. The message will be sent to the user's contacts with the user's address. Afterwards, the user can press "no need" when the problem has been handled. ## How it works
                </p>
                <p>
                    As our first venture into the android platform, we had difficulties with connecting Android Studio to Parse and our testing devices. In addition, compiling the different components required to make Zoom work (contacts, geolocation, etc.) proved difficult but we were able to overcome these issues. ## Challenges I ran into
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the successful creation of our first app in this short time frame and creating something that can be useful for all sorts of people. ## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </p>
                <p>
                    XML, design, Android Studio, and Parse were only a few things that we have learned through this intensive experience. ## What I learned
                </p>
                <p>
                    The future Zoom will include compatibility with Facebook for easier contact additions, along with high-end aesthetics, and more customizable settings for the comfort of the user. ## What's next for Zoom
