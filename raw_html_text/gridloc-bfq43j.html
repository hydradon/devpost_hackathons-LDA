                    A big amount of the world's population doesn't have street addresses. Cheap smartphones and GPS's are allowing systems to be adopted as solutions for people to be able to communicate location information to each other. There's a lot of theoretical papers but very few implementations with high accuracy so we decided to work on this. -Kevin

                    Our project is an extended application of
                    <strong>
                        The Maidenhead Locator System
                    </strong>
                    which is a method for identifying positions on Earth commonly used by VHF/UHF enthusiasts. The position information is represented in a higher level of precision(roughly 10 meters). Pairs of characters alternate between letters and numbers to indicate a zone or a sub-zone.

                    A system of a similar implementation would be used in developing countries, it'll be really helpful for both companies and clients. If fully developed it could become an official address system as well.
