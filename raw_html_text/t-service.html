                    Now a days time and money are the predominant aspects, so with this project we can utilize them effectively using this Transportation service
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It provides shared services such as rides and couriers between out of states with the flexible options
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It is developed with HTML,CSS,Php,Bootstrap and MySql
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We create our app, TransportMe!, to help the average citizen travel and deliver their packages at a cheaper price. Unlike other transportational services like Uber or Lyft, TransportMe!'s prices will not vary depending on the time and day. It will be a fixed price, cheaper than those of other services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user will simply register and login through our app, input current location and desired destination, and hit enter!
He/she will then be able to choose to use a ride or provide a ride. If he/she chooses a ride, he can then select himself as the passenger, and/or he could have his items couriered for him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will almost be a cheaper from of Uber and mailing serivces like UPS combined!
