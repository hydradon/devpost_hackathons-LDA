                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More than 300 million people worldwide are not able to recognise all colours - they suffer from colour vision deficiency  (CVD) and therefore are often called colourblind. We are courageous to help these people to participate better in the world wide web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our AddOn starts with a small test, which spots if the user is colourblind - and which kind of CVD. There are different kinds of colourblindnesses. We differ between Protanomaly, Protanopia, Deuteranomaly, Deuteranopia, Tritanomaly, and Tritanopia, also the different dichromatic and anomalous trichromatic CVDs. With an algorithm we change the colours so, that only colours are used which are visible and distinguishable for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed an AddOn for Mozilla Firefox using javascript. First, you can choose from which kind of CVD you suffer. Likewise, we wrote a script to convert the colours in javascript. Therefore, we read colours, convert them first to RGB values if they are not in RGB yet, then convert them to HSL, converting by a image processing algorithm within HSL and converting back to RGB before replacing the old page by the new one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us usually don't code much in javascript, so this was a big challenge for all of us. The problem that challenged us the most is executing the code on the users machine, since most html files are really big so that we ran into performance issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became a great team. Also developing the algorithm that changes the colors to make the users life easier was a difficult task we managed. Due it looks different than real views it is very useful for CVD patients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to increase our social and web developing skills. It's the first hackathon of three of four.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Colour Deficiency Extension
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are different further possibilities to extent this tool. The smallest additional is a test which kind of CVD you suffer from. We started building an AI, but didn't get time to implement it. It can be extended for other visually impaired people, e.g. by bigger font sizes or by increasing contrasts and saturation. Another extension could be the hatching of different colours for graphs and diagrams, also used for gray-scale prints. Although, there are some people with monochromacy which need other requirements for viewing. Techniques for this could be really difficult.
