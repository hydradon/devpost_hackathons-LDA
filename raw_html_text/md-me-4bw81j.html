                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects doctors and their patients so they can directly contact each other without the need of an appointment.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the framework of a website's coding to create our own landing page for the site. From there we used JSON files to create a user storage server for both the patients and their doctors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the landing page wasn't much of a big deal given that the framework for the website already existed and just needed to be edited to fit our own website, but creating the user storage system took a bit of research to figure out how to properly be used.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our team's first hackathon and we are all beginners at coding, one teammate didn't even have any experience coding at all, so this was a great experience to get an idea of what a coding project an be like and we really bonded as a group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding can be done quickly when you know what you're doing and the framework exists to help you code, but when you don't know what to do or how to do something, there are always resources available to newer coders to help them understand and accomplish their ideas and projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MD&amp;ME
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, given that most of our group is in Computer Science majors and the other in a Health major, we can take MD&amp;ME into the real world where the need for quick communication between patients and doctors are needed in several different fields of health. We can only hope that in the future services like MD&amp;ME exist to help healthcare services in the world.
