                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a program that ties together cybersecurity, fun, programming, and networking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a dangerous challenge for your computer, and must be executed with caution. It's a program that auto-replicates until the user stops the timer. Whichever computer can survive the longest wins. When the user stops the timer, the user sends a screen shot to the lolbat email. It's like a game of chicken - who will back off first? Who is going to risk gigbytes of gibberish being written in a directory, which could crash their OS, to be the Lolbat champion?! And the website is sweet.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python, then turned it to an .exe. I put the file on an aws server
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a difficult time working with aws (very complex) and I had trouble creating the replication program
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I proud of the website that I made. I really like designing websites and this is my best one yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use aws, register a domain, and learned how to create a .py to an .exe.
                </p>

                    What's next for LolBat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Who knows? Maybe a GUI in the future? A feature that automatically emails the lolbat email?
