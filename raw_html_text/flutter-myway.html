                    Stories of people not being able to have the same experience due to their disabilities and the thought of what if we could help make the world a little more accessible by encouraging and education through this platform?

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally built it using Swift and Apple APIs and now have bridge it to Google's Flutter SDK which would make it have the same feel across mobile platforms while scaling for the future.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google's built-in frameworks for such things as Google Maps didn't completely expose the view into the accessibility system for handsets The work around I came up with right now without breaking the SDK on both Android and iOS. This inadvertently removed indication of your current position.

                <p>
                    I got to share my enthusiasm for advocating and designing for accessibility and being able to unify the look and feel on both Android and iOS

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    There is still a lot of work needed to be done with MyWay but there are some widgets that need to be audited and fixed on Google's part.
