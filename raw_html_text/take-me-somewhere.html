                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the things I would like to do in the future is to travel and see more countries in the world. My father worked in trade, and when I was very young, he constantly stressed the importance of seeing places and people that are different than yourself. Unfortunately, I haven't really had the independence nor the time to experience this want. I really wanted to learn about some awesome places to travel in the world in the future, so I thought that building an application to achieve exactly this service would be good. Not only would I learn about awesome places in the process, I can also share this knowledge with other people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a tinder for travel destination of sorts. Users basically have a choice to match with certain places in the world. It's fun. You see a picture of the place. You read a little history of the place. You read about cool spots in the place. And then it gives you an option to learn more about it through other sources like Youtube, Google, and allow you to book tickets and plan your trip if you want to go. It also saves these "matches" so you can view them in the future, like a bucket list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back-end is built with ruby on rails. I styled the website front-end with HTML and bootstrap. The application stores many "places" objects in the database, and it will show a place to the user. If the user clicks "yes", it will add that "place" object to the users's places. I used rails to load all of the user's "matched" places.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I ran into many challenges. I had no experience with Design. HTML/CSS/Bootstrap were all pretty unfamiliar to me. Working by myself, I constantly learned and had to solve problems on both ends.  For example I was not too familiar with REST requirements, and as a result I had problems working with different function and different views. It wasn't too hard, but I eventually figured out many of Bootstrap's cool features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of creating an application that is actually fun to use.  I think it's actually useful and can provide real value to other people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I worked by myself so I had to do both front-end and back-end. I learned alot about design. It was my first time working with bootstrap and I learned alot about making good UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Take Me Somewhere
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can't wait to work on Take Me Somewhere in the future. In the future I would like to keep track of the user's preference. And based on the user's preferences such as Language spoken in country, Budget, Distance away from home, and also past matches of countries, I would like to add data analysis that gives the user recommendations of countries that are better suited for the user.
