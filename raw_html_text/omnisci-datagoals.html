                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data in the OmniSci platform is very interesting as it gives us real informations about traffic

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works like magic, we use the data provided by Uber Mouvement and US travel services to check how accurate travel times are compared to distances, unfortunately we are not able to present a working product

                    Using Javascript, yarn and some classic web dev kit, yarn and node.js
