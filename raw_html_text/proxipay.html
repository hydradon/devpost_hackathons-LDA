                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pitt Job fair. I spent too much time writing down my email and filling out my details instead of spending that meaningful time talking with representatives of the company

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses QR as an ID to an event or schedule. People just need to scan the QR and their email/information is shared with the host and they are added to the events list of attendees. The host can send push notifications to all who have

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an android app we used Android studio to develop the app for the most part. We used Parse as the back end framework and the ZXING library to create custom encoded QR codes

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard configuring the bitmaps needed to produce the QR codes. We also had a lot of trouble configuring the user interface, often times the app would crash suddenly due to unexpected bugs.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get everything working for the most part. We overcame the most important challenge which was figuring out the encoding, this was probably one of the bigger accomplishments of the application.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Any one can build a mobile app, it just a matter of coming up with an idea and sticking with it even though there are long periods of time when it seems that there is no progress. We also learned how to use the ZXING library and parse-android, among other things.

                    What's next for ProxiPay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a venmo implementation where events can have a cost, the most important use being charity. Instead of people carrying cash around a simple venmo transaction would be more convenient and safer. It would make donations, paid events, or anything involving the need for cash or money. We actually had the code ready to go to implement, however, we were never able to get approval to use the API. We would also like to develop NFC based support later down on in the future.
