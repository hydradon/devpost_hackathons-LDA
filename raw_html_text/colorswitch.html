                    As students brought together in our introduction to programming class this previous year, this project has challenged our newfound abilities to apply all that we have learned into a full-fledged java project. We were inspired to model the game Color Switch, in which the user controls the movement of a bouncing ball by pressing one key to move it up across a belt that changes color. The belt and the ball must be the same color for it to pass. Using components of graphical user interface and coding logic, our team successfully applied our java skills to a real world example. We are extremely excited to present our first self-coded java project, and hope you enjoy!
