                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of us enjoyed playing games online and asked the rest of us for help on an anagram puzzle. It was a challenging word, and we could not solve it. We decided to create an anagram game in which we could enter our own words and challenge each other to solve it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user enters a word and then the word is scrambled. The scrambled clue is displayed and the user is given chances to guess the word. Each word starts at 10 points, and its value decreases over the course of the game. If the user guesses a wrong answer, the word's worth decreases by 1, and if the user asks for a hint, it decreases by 2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At one point, we wanted to all guess the word, so we needed the computer to generate its own word for us to guess. We had to establish a word bank for the computer to pull from and make sure that there were no words repeated.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The method we used for scrambling the word needed conversions from a string to a character array, and then back again.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are always things to add on to the game, and there is always stuff to work on.
