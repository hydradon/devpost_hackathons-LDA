                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Liberty Mutual once said "Our challenge to you is to create a fun &amp; wacky solution that puts humans at the center of your design." And from there we realized: what if we made an app...that literally puts a human at the center?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Human centered literally takes photos and makes you the center of attention! It simply removes other people by obscuring others' faces, making it clear in group photo who the real star is around here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose to make a web-app so that it is easily accessible through both mobile devices and computers. We used javascript to handle the image facial recognition and subsequent editing completely client-side, meaning it works, even offline, without communication to server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we wanted to use AWS's Rekognition API. We discovered a couple of difficulties, including setting up a proper way to communicate different parameters after facial detection, so we used a library in JS instead. We also had a little trouble thinking of the structure for a purely client-side implementation, but we managed to make it work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Human Centered
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully in the future we can introduce simpler blurring instead of direct covering - looks a little less cheesy, effect would be a little more subtle as well.
