                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django REST framework for the back end, and React for the frontend.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty configuring React for use with Django REST framework, and learning how Django works.

                <p>
                    We worked pretty well as a team!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to find a faster to configure tech stack that we are more familiar with. That involves taking deliberate time before the hackathon to familiarize. #fullstackjavascriptbros

                    Finish deploying the website itself, and then look into deeper analytics with ML/NLP.
