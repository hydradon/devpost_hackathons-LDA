                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to produce a simple to use visualization system which can unfold the sequences of events as though we were watching it in real-time. Just like a movie can take us through each character's day, we wanted to emulate that experience with our product to provide a clear picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product simulates the events of the Murder of Richcraft Hall using simple visual representations.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used SQL Lite as the database and used Python 3 to create the GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration of all the different parts

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completed the project in a timely manner
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Richcraft Hotel (formerly known as the River Building)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we believe that this product can have the option for law enforcement to import their blueprints in a user-friendly manner and add suspects with a few clicks of a button. Eventually, the software can be used in a user encrypted end to end so that more agencies can use this tool.
