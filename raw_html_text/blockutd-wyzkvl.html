                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try learning something completely new, and thought of going down the finance route while keeping the project personal to us
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many productivity apps reward you for being productive. That may be a good incentive, but we felt that it wasn't good enough. blockUTD blocks the user from using social media, and in the case that they still use social media, they are fined a small fee to a friend who also uses the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time working with crypto and blockchain so we couldn't get that part to quite work out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app itself is somewhat demoable
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about crypto
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for blockUTD
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue to implement the features we couldn't get to.
