                    While looking through the hardware that MLH had to offer at the hackathon, we found the Leap Motion. After playing around with the demo functions for a while, we could see that it was an incredibly versatile piece of technology. Inspired by its ability to so closely replicate games such as Sevens and Squash, we wanted to create a virtual version. Because of the sci-fi like aspects of the concept, we decided to go with a space theme for the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally we wanted to create a web app, using Python or Javascript. However, we soon discovered numerous difficulties associated with accessing the data from the Leap Motion over the web. So instead, we decided to use Unity to develop and offline game that could connect straight to the Leap Motion. None of us had ever used Unity before, so we had quite a lot of trouble getting anything off the ground at first. Eventually, we actually started to figure things out, and before any of us knew it, we had a (semi) functioning space-based squash game. Just having the game wasn't enough, I mean, how could anyone play it if it was offline?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, from our previous attempts to make a web app, we already had some semblance of a web page on which we would have uploaded our game. We decided that instead of abandoning all of that work, we would instead convert it into a landing page, on which people could download the game, as well as see a trailer and behind the scenes photos from our work on Quantum-Leap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, we really had an amazing time working together to create this fun little project. We all learned a whole load of stuff that we would never have really had the chance to even see, much less use and explore for a whole 24 hours - to top it all off, we actually managed to achieve, not one, but 2 different finished products that we are all very proud of.
