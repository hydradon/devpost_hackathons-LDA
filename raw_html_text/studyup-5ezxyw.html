                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Studying and working on assignments with other people can be very helpful, but sometimes none of your friends are near by.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects people who are in the same courses to form study sessions together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can create a new study session or join an existing one, filtering by classes.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an app using Flutter with Android Studio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also built a Flask/MySQL webapp on Google Cloud Platform to store and retrieve data for our users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very inexperienced Android developers and we used Flutter for the first time this weekend. Only one of us has any server side experience and he&rsquo;s not great at SQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    Our App
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Android noobs learned and built an application with Flutter! Evan learned he never wants to do mobile ever again.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Our Server
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It runs and handles requests like a champ! Migrations, connections from local machines,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so much about Android development (mainly Evan and Josh), Flutter, REST APIs, server models (mainly Tim), and asynchronous functions. Also Google Cloud Platform is great!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StudyUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add friends in the app, a log in page, and even integrate with College room booking services.
