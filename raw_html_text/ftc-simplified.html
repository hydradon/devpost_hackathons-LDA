                    T## Inspiration
The challenge corresponded with our outreach strategy, which is to expand STEM and prepare the next generation.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows players to create robots and come up with strategies to maximize their points for each particular game.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Sublime 3 and HTML coding to assemble our website and attempted to build the game by using Scratch.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is our first hackathon and we don't have a lot of experience coding, we weren't sure how to begin the challenge and sometimes needed help creating the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to create something that looks almost finished. There are buttons that lead to links and those were very difficult to create, so we consider that an accomplishment as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to be patient when the code isn't working, to listen to each other's ideas, to manage our time wisely, and a lot of teamwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ftc simplified
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to further develop the game and use it during our outreach events throughout our robotics season in order to not only engage kids in robotics, but to also have them interested in STEM.
