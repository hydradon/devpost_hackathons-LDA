                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we have a lot of emails in our inboxes. Our team was curious to learn more about our inboxes and see what sorts of trends we could find.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Email Analysis Tool provides a simple platform for you to learn about your inbox. You sign into your Gmail account, and the tool displays a webpage containing some bar graphs and data tables that summarize various aspects of your email.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote Python code for the server and also used Jinja to automatically create html for the front end. We used the Gmail API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced challenges regarding optimizing runtime for large inboxes. We also faced challenges regarding streamlining the user experience at first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We produced a web application that successfully allows a user to log in to their Gmail and see statistics about their inbox in one very concise place. We also overcame many challenges along the way to get to the final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the power of resilience and determination in developing a project from start to finish. Also, Hackathons are fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Email Analysis Tool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make our tool compatible with computers of all ages/types. We also want to translate this application to a publicly accessible web application so that anybody can use it.
