                <p>
                    An Android application to provide street parking information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It can be intimidating for drivers who happen upon unknown streets with unknown signs. However, with our community based street mapping application can relieve some of that intimidation. ECParking features a better way for users to understand the parking information they need; from foreign signs to roads that are under construction. With the help of our community we can make driving and parking a much better experience.
                </p>

                    User Cases:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Kevin updates our application by saying that the street between 70th to 71st street has street cleaning on Monday from 9am to 10am. Frankie understands that street cleaning is under effect and would stray away from unparkable area.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Syed notices that his street is going to be under maintenance from October 13 to October 14 and posts this on our community based application. Hugo during by doesn't have to be confused as to why his favorite parking spot is closed on that day.
