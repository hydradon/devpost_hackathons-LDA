                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HNotifier is an mobile application made with the goal of enhancing communication between organizers and hackers during hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since participants will be scattered in different places, getting information and the latest updates to everyone is important so the hackers would not miss anything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was heavily based off of the HackWestern app, which allowed the organizers to inform the hackers of delays or activity/workshop starting times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The frontend was created using the Ionic framework with a Java backend. The communication between the client and server used JSON.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most annoying problem we encountered was CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). Since we had the front-end and back-end on different computers, it prevented us from effectively integrating them together. This was added onto the fact that our back-end was custom written in Java, there wasn't much documentation available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that API design and communication is very important. We had a bit of mishap when we misunderstood the "/hackathon/id" endpoint with "/hackathon/:id". In the future, we would strive to plan the API before hand, making less redundant code.
