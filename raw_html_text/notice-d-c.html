                    Inspiration: I was inspired by the incidents I've had in D.C where I run into homeless individuals and I am not sure what to do to help them.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It provides a list of homeless shelters in your area based on your location. This way, if you find a homeless individual, you can help them.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I used Swift to code.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: The geolocation wasn't working the way I had planned so I had to hard-code the list of shelters in for the current area we are in.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I am proud of the fact that the application has a lot of views which means a lot of potential for growth.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I have never attempted to use mapkit or geolocation in any of my apps before so this was interesting.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Notice D.C: I will fix the geolocation problem and work on a visual display to show the results.
