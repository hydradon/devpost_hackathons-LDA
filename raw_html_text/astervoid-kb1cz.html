                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to join a project for Oculus Rift development and wanted more experience using the technologies involved. We wanted to work on a project that would expose us to the complexity and strength of the Unreal Engine, Razer Hydras, and the Oculus Rift, and thus Astervoid was built to create an enjoyable, immersive gaming experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unreal Engine to create an endless flying game where players must avoid asteroids and laser barriers to survive. The player puts on the Oculus Rift and controls movement through the trigger buttons on the Hydras.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of internet, lack of power, lack of knowledge, lack of sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game! We're excited to have started and completed a game within such a small amount of time when none of our teammates had had any prior experience with the Unreal Engine 4.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to texture, 3D model, work with Blueprint, create actions and dependencies, create a game soundtrack.
                </p>

                    What's next for Astervoid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to be able to make the experience more polished and immersive.
