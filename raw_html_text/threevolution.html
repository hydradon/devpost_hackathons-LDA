                    Inspiration we wanted to make a computer game that improved, and provided multiple games as well a make something that is fun for us and our friends to use.

                    What it does The app is online, and learns from the opponents an gets harder as it progresses.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it We used a java papplet. Then we uploaded to html, on our .tech
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into were game design and machine learning. Also many small glitches that happened from one tiny spelling issue
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of we are proud of the games and how it gets harder as well as how fun it was play
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned We learned is how to use multiple games in one piece of code and how to make a interesting game that people would play and even get hooked too.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Threevolution is that we want to organize our code better as well as use methods and a bunch of other short cuts to make the code more readable. Also to label the code in more places and add more complicated games to the overarching game.
