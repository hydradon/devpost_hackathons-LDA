                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The disappearance of local news outlets has brought many dire consequences that range from increased corruption to news manipulation through fake news.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates a content based on the user (reporter) input then it's hashed and put into a syndicate contract, there reporters can claim ownership and receive payments system a logarithmic growth scheme
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Tensorflow and Texar to generate the news, flask to serve the content, truffle. MetaMask and ganache to deploy and test the contracts
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a decent dataset was tough, and computer power for the training as limited
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The content is decent enough for the limited amount of time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Self generated content is a BIG problem that need to be addressed ASAP
                </p>
