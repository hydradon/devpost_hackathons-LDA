                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are passionate about assisting military members to overcome tough times and mental challenges. We were inspired by the available research about
                    <strong>
                        Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
                    </strong>
                    which has been shown to be one of the most effective means to treat mental disorders in veterans. We realize that veterans lack access to mental health support, which may lead to worsening symptoms, long-term unemployment and high suicide rates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to address a veteran&rsquo;s negative thoughts and emotions. It redirects these by providing a new positive perspective to encourage cognitive reprocessing. In the app, a veteran is able to write out their day and then their journal is analyzed by flagged keywords. To redirect any negative thoughts or emotions, the app will recommend a positive activity or helpful resource. A veteran&rsquo;s progress can be tracked on a graph, which is part of the process for behavioral therapy so that they can see the days they had negative and positive emotions and therefore track their progress and identify negative processing directly.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used InVision for the prototype and attempted Java for the backend and Python for our keyword recognition component.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have applied technology to help address mental health problems in the veteran community.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work well as a team and contribute ideas and design as well as how to effectively project plan and implement those ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we had difficulty to finish the coding parts of the app with Java and Python, we tried our best and learned new things like connecting Java APIs and had fun. One of our biggest challenges was keeping the focus of our app clear and simple for the user.
