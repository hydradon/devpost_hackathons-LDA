                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not enough real-time data on the environmental impact of public transportation in Chicago.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a website that displays graphs and tracks real-time data to keep accurate metrics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Flask python module to create a simple website and the CTA's API to count the number of active buses and trains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web server was error prone and difficult to work with.  We also had far more trouble processing the data the CTA's API provided than we had originally projected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully using the CTA's API to extract real-time data and meaningfully integrate it with data analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to extract web data through beautiful soup, and create graphs with matplotlib.
