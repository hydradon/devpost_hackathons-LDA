                    Given the current political climate, we wanted to get a better understanding of how our media sites reflect and influence our views. A recent article by

                    talks about ways to understand and and communicate with people with opposing views by understanding their values. Through our project, we hope to make people aware of their biases, bridge the disconnect between the left and right, and spur more meaningful conversation.

                <p>
                    Initially, we wanted to use information from Facebook's Graph API so we could retrieve data on the media found in the user's newsfeed. However, we had issues retrieving the data and ended up switching to data collected from people's browser history. Also, asynchronous data calls in javascript.
