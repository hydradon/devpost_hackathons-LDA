                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every time we fly, we run into troubles. Do we use our Aeroplan points, Air Miles rewards, or our Flying Blue points? Which is worth more? Do we have enough of each to buy the flights we want?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To ease the overall frequent flyer experience, we designed an app to both keep track of rewards, and find the most cost-efficient way to use various reward programs for upcoming trips.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Travlr has two key tabs:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Find flights. Enter your desired travel information and find all possible flights with their most cost-friendly point value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Manage points. Keep your frequent flyer reward numbers and balances in one spot.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed this app using Sketch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being four friends who hadn't seen each other in four years became a challenge. We struggled to stay focused and choose one idea when we had many floating around. With our various skill sets, we also struggled to find something that allowed each of us to learn and grow.
Once we chose Travlr, our biggest challenge was defining the meaning of &ldquo;cheapest flight&rdquo;, in terms of the points from various reward systems and the dollar value of the flight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest learnings was to focus on the task at hand and code as a group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Travlr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to build this app in the near future using travel reward APIs and swift.
