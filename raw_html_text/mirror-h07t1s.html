                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever been at a party and someone takes a picture of you but forgets to send it to you? Or in a situation where you accidentally photobomb of a couple taking a picture? Or at the Eiffel Tower, and people are snapping pictures and video of everything around them and you are in some of them? With our app, Candid, we give you a way to get all the pictures that have your face in them. Imagine if you could get all the pictures ever taken of you, accidentally or intentionally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every time someone near you takes a picture of you, you get it using facial recognition technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Expo and React-Native to build an app that would be supported on both Android and iOS. For the Server-side we used Express, Node and S3 for AWS services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we had was to minimize the amount of images uploaded and speeding up the facial recognition software, so that the experience was seamless. When someone takes a picture of you, we want you to get it as fast as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of designing the UI such that it is simple and beautiful. We had no experience with Expo before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expo doesn't support Bluetooth yet. Or WebRTC.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Candid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement support for video. There are also some features that would speed up you getting the picture, such as taking into account the direction where the camera is pointing and the location where people are standing.
