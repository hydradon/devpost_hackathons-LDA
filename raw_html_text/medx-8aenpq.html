                    <strong>
                        250,000 people in the United States die every year from medical negligence. However, it is not negligence that leads to the most fatalities, complications, and increased hospitalizations. Rather, it is the lack of universally accessible patient medical records and software to encourage teams of doctors to work together for every patient.  After thousands of hours spent shadowing and working in the medical sector, our team set off to catalyze modern medicine.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the current system of medical records, Emergency Room physicians are given little to no information on patients, and in many severe cases, have no time to collect it. Patients with certain diseases can suffer fatal consequences if given many common medications, including Aspirin. ER doctors have no way of knowing this if the patient is unconscious or non expressive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctors in different networks have limited communication. This is especially pertinent as almost half of all doctors are in private practice. When a patient&rsquo;s doctors do not work together, misdiagnosis, polypharmacy, and extreme change of prescriptions become rampant. Commonly, a doctor will give a patient a new medication that does not work well with drugs being prescribed by the patient&rsquo;s other doctors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a patient visits a new doctor for the first time, the doctor must get all their information by interviewing the patient. This means that doctors are forced to rely on a patient&rsquo;s memory, rather than past medical records, to provide life or death information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctors must be able to work together, using cloud based information, in order to provide modern healthcare.

                        A patient, John Doe, is involved in a car crash and suffers a severe left arm injury, and immediately rushed to the ER. At the hospital, a doctor scans Doe's medx ID to get Doe's profile on his phone. He checks known allergies to see if Doe is allergic to EpiPen which he wants to use to help stop bleeding. He sees that Doe is severely allergic and uses a pressure system to stop bleeding instead, avoiding a fatal allergic reaction.

                    <strong>
                        ER doctors then perform surgery and note this as a procedure. The doctors want to prescribe Doe Vicodin as a pain reliever, but as they can see on his diagnosis medx profile he suffers from substance abuse disorder; so instead they raise the dosage of his already existing Norco prescription, a less addictive opioid.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Doe's primary doctor back home now sees on medx that Doe just had a left arm trauma procedure and that his dosage of Norco was raised. Now during Doe's visit to the primary doctor next week, the doctor is fully up to speed on Doe's medical history and can even message Doe's surgical team at the ER any questions, because they are now active in Doe's system. Without medx, Doe's primary doctor and surgical team are not connected and Doe's primary is likely to reduce the Norco prescription back to normal, thinking there was a mistake.

                <p>
                    medx exists as a website and as an accompanying app. A patient creates a profile on the website (age, ethnicity, ssn, name, username) and is
                    <strong>
                        automatically generated a patient ID and data matrix
                    </strong>
                    . The user then downloads the app and can now login to generate the same data matrix. The user will also be sent a physical ID card with this data matrix to keep in a wallet in case of severe accident when the phone cannot be unlocked (patient unconscious).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A physician creates a profile on the website with their DEA identifier, and can now input a patient's ID number when the patient comes to their office for a first visit, or use the medx app to scan a patient's data matrix in emergency medicine. They now gain access to a patient's medical records compliant with HIPPA based regulations and security focus. With medx, a doctor uses a streamlined, universal, cloud based system, instead of being at the mercy of a patient's memory or limited understanding of their medical profile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a physician enter a patient's unique identifier or scans their data matrix, they can access the patient's medications, diagnosis, lab results, medical imaging results, past procedures, and doctor's notes for all of these. medx is unique in that it has built in discussion threads so that doctors can message in real time to coordinate patient care across specialties so that the entire network of care is always working together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    medx uses a collection of algorithms to detect dangerous combinations of medical data in a patient's profile and marks these in red to attract a doctor's attention. An example of this is that a patient with a rare disease called RCVS cannot take Aspirin or other NSAIDS. On the dashboard for a patient with RCVS who was just prescribed aspirin by a doctor, would appear a red warning under a section named "contraindications" which cross references a patient's known diseases and their prescriptions to find dangerous combinations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    medx allows a doctor to download a complete report for the patient so that the doctor can store this in their personal visit records.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    medx was built in three parts: frontend, backend, and mobile. We built the backend as an express-based node.js web server using a REST api to deliver data from a mongodb database. The frontend is a dashboard-based interface using Bootstrap. The mobile app is an iOS app built using swift.
