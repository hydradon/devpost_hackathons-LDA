                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to design something that could impact the development field positively and give more freedom to the individual. We also wanted to build something that was relevant and would allow us to jump into web design as neither of us had any experience with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We (eventually will) connect freelance developers and companies in need of technical help. Our goal is to make it easier for independent developers to find work and for companies to hire temporary positions. This isn't an internship site, we want to provide businesses not looking to hire full-time computer science positions connect connect them with reliable, skilled independent developers who intend to remain independent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask(html, css, python)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to DNS propagation taking longer than the scope of the hackathon to go live we were unable to get the site up at lioneagle.life(domain which we own).Working on the back end and saving information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed a good looking website with little to no web development experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each of us got first time experience with html, css, and/or python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for lionEagle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once aws is up we will be migrating to amazon's web hosting using the lioneagle.life domain purchased on namecheap.
