                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are no good IDE's for introductory computer science students, hence where the name ICSIDE(Introductory Computer Science Student Integrated Development Enviornment). They also struggle to connect to the gl, or remote linux servers, to work on their projects. So all of this came into the challenge of developing an IDE that solves this issue
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a difference between what it does and what it should do. It should be able to highlight C++ and Python syntax as well as find syntactical errors. While also local and remote compiling to gl along with gl file viewing. What we actually accomplished was the syntax highlighting for C++ and local compiling of the C++ using g++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built ICSIDE in C++ using wxWidgits. The background tasking was also done in C++.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was simply not enough time to complete the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the fact that the ui shows up and we can type into it. It did come like this by default, so this was a big milestone for us. Also getting our syntax highlighting was a high point!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C++ is a bad language for string processing, and wxWidgets is misleading in what it comes with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ICSIDE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing the IDE to the standards that we wanted to achieve as well as getting it to the CS students!
