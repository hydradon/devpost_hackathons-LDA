                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are 4.2B people in the world who are still not connected to the internet and this phone will allow them a cheap alternative to get connected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it is supposed to work
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We host an Android OS in the cloud with AWS and connect to it via VNC on an arduino board and output the video with VGA to a display screen. Unfortunately, due to network issues, hardware issues, and time issues, we were not able to accomplish a fully functioning model so we attempted to use a raspberry pi instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Network issues would not allow our VM's to download proper OS and libraries faster than 4-5 hours a piece which slowed us down significantly.
We did not bring all the hardware we needed (we forgot some cables and pieces to connect arduino wirelessly).
We lost a ton of time waiting for downloads and updating outdated libraries. (For example, arduino hasn't had a VNC viewer client pushed for 4 years and there is no support in the community with it)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Uploading an Android OS in the cloud.
VNC from the cloud to a client.

                    Always test localhost first

                <p>
                    Figure out how to get arduino a functioning VNC Viewer client that functions properly. After, figure out how to get arduino to not load images pixel by pixel.
