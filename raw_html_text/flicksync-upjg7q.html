                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine becoming your favorite movie character by taking their place as the main star. Embodying Darth Vader and &ldquo;altering the deal&rdquo;, or stepping into Jack Sparrow&rsquo;s boots and drunkenly slurring &ldquo;where&rsquo;s the rum?!&rdquo; Innovative entertainment means taking mediums we know and love and taking a new perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another main inspiration was Ernest Cline&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ready Player One&rdquo;. In the story, when an OASIS avatar begins a FlickSync game, they become a specific character from a movie and have to recite lines of dialogue. When the avatar speaks, they will speak in the voice of the specific character, move around as the character, see, hear, and feel anything the character would see, hear, and feel in the movie.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can take on the roles of their favorite story characters, acting out scenes and speaking the lines of their assigned character. They enter into the Tea Party scene from Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland and become Alice, the Mad Hatter, or the March Hare. They can also play the scenes with their friends, with each person being assigned different characters using their own Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Windows MR headsets. During the scenes, when a character needs to speak, a cue card shows the user the lines assigned to them. They have to speak the lines correctly within an assigned period of time. Players are scored by how well they speak their lines of dialogue. The title of winner of the game goes to whoever gets the highest percentage!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity with collaboration through Github.  We used SDKs for voice recognition and split the integration of those SDKs between the devs.  The artist created 3d models for the scene and the director made a script and recorded our audio.  We then built out the game logic, and tested with several mentors for a few rounds of feedback for the polish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Public Domain Story:
While there are a ton of amazing stories we would have loved to pick scenes from, including Star Wars, The Princess Bride, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Monty Python &amp; The Holy Grail, Pulp Fiction, The Room, etc. the scope of this Hackathon required us to pick a story that was in the public domain and that was instantly recognizable. We decided on Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland as this fit the bill for the Creating Reality Hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Watson Speech to Text API:
The Watson Speech to Text API was a little bit of a challenge to work with, but was extremely crucial to the success of this project as it hinges on speech recognition. The main struggle was in determining whether the user had said the correct lines and this was done through C# scripts analyzing the words said (given by Watson) and the current line they were assigned (via JSON). Another issue we faced is sometimes Watson Speech to Text API struggles with certain words and phrases making it a little difficult to properly emulate lines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Photon &amp; Watson conflicting about microphone ownership
We used Photon for the multiplayer aspect of this project and encountered a few difficulties concerning the microphone ownership. Both Photon &amp; Watson would fight for ownership of the microphone and so ultimately our solution was to share it, but initially this was a big issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multiplayer Virtual Reality:
Our multiplayer functionality ultimately wasn&rsquo;t working 100% up to our standards but getting both players synced up and hearing each other did end up working. We struggled greatly with placement of players as each player is assigned a unique role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Animation:
We knew we wouldn&rsquo;t have time to animate lip synced facial animation, so we used hand drawn facial animations hovering right in front of the character&rsquo;s faces. This allowed us for a faster workflow and ended up being a quick fix that worked very well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Original Assets:
While it might look good to use pre-made free assets, we decided it would look even better if we utilized the talents of our very own team to create unique stylistic beautiful art assets. We created 3d characters, sounds fx, and music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Character acting:
There was a lot of dialogue, and 4 characters that already needed to be designed, modeled, painted, and rigged, which didn&rsquo;t leave a lot of time to animate each character speaking their unique lines. We designed a single talking animation for each character due to the time constraint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of putting together a gorgeous and fun scene from Alice in Wonderland that allows the user to act out the part of Alice. 
We are proud to have gotten the multiplayer experience working, and for the Watson and Photon SDKs to be working together well. We are especially proud of the great teamwork throughout the few days. We made decisions quickly and each team member made unique contributions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to get multiplayer working (save a few bugs), how to use Watson, and how to get Unity working well with a team, working on it through Github and Source Tree. We tracked our tasks by using Trello having four columns - To Do, Work in Progress, Ready for QA, Done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FlickSync
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The potential of the tools and game we created is huge. 
We want to implement the following features: 
Track blocking and character action depending on the scene (interacting with props, moving around, throwing things)
Camera To Watch Performance (if you want to re-watch or record from 3rd person)
Multiplayer without bugs. 
Characters synced up in multiplayer 
A hard mode for disabling the cue cards
Movable and grabable cue card like a tablet
More comprehensive report card
Smarter Watson Speech-to-Text Checking
HoloLens and mobile VR headset support
Voice Augmentation depending on character
                </p>
                <p>
                    FlickSync could be a used as a tool for actors looking to practice lines, or an artist could produce a full length play all in VR!
