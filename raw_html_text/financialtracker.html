                    With tons of personal banking and financial tracking apps with their fancy algorithms and goal setting, nothing in the market actually motivates users to become financially conscious

                    . Teenagers today have increasingly short attention spans. Instant gratification in snap reactions, YouTube videos, and mobile games has this generation with everything available at their fingertips. Our app
                    <strong>
                        Don't Pig Out!
                    </strong>
                    targets this wide audience by using visual game-like elements, embedded analytics, and personal finance tracking to incentivize users to spend money wisely or have their pig suffer! Everyone loves animals, and with a pig on the line, users have direct feedback on their unwise financial decisions. It's either save or slaughter.

                    Financial transactions are tracked over time, creating various visualizations and graphs of user purchase history. An analysis of individualized trends also customizes the pig over time to closely mirror user spending habits and keep the user more attached to their grocery-bag-toting or movie-obsessing pig.

                    With the trending push away from cash and towards electronic payments, people don't feel the effect of giving up wads of cash while they swipe their plastic cards to their heart's contents. Teenagers who spend their time playing games and less time budgeting money will appreciate the cute motivation
