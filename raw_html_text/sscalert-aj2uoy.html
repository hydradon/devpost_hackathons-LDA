                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every semester, students compete for the limited seats in their desired/ required courses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To tackle this problem, my team members and I created this project to notify us when our desired courses have vacant spots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used several APIs to build this project. For example, we used Jsoup to parse the website and record the number of seats available every few seconds. We used the Javax.Mail API to send an email to our email inbox.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced several obstacles since the beginning of this project. For instance, none of us knew how to create GUI, and a webserver for our project. Each of us had to learn something new and contribute to this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of our final product. Moreover, the most important lesson learned from this project is the sense of teamwork and individual responsibilities we learned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create Basic GUI, backend servers, socket programming, and OOP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SSCAlert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand its features. For example, we plan to send text to phones, develop it into an app, and host it on a webserver.
