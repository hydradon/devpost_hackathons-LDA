                    When a beginner or someone wants to learn programming, the first question should always be which programming language I learn first? Nowadays there's so many information, you may be overwhelmed and have no idea what to do. Someone may have a friend using java, she or he then just begin to learn it even if python or CSS may be a better choice for her/him. They may make the wrong choice and give up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first learn java 3 months ago. I just run into a java Bootcamp and start to learn it.  I'm lucky enough that I'm good at it and enjoy learning it. But I'm not good at CSS and HTML. As a beginner If I choose to learn CSS and HTML first I may lose my passion and give.

                    Some people are interested in coding, But they may think themselves not smart enough or scared off by some thoughts like "I'm too old to learn it", "I'm a female, should I learn it?".

                    I use flutter and Dart to build this mobile app. It's a powerful language you can use the same code base for both iOS and Android platform. I also use google cloud and firebase auth. I also use plugins to embed youtube in my app.

                    I started to learn flutter and Dart 3 days ago. I'm not very familiar with it. There are so many things I want to do. The IOS configuration has some issue, Android is working perfectly. My English is not good enough. I have difficulty writing this description.
