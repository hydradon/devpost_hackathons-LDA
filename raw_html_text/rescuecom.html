                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've been inspired by the deck provided by Accenture folks. There's a number of massively important problems that have to do with communications in case of a disaster.
                    <strong>
                        We ourselves came for the hackathon from Poland where we had plenty of natural disasters strike our country this year - the problem we're trying to solve is real.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows people to communicate with other people in the same geographical area, receive broadcasts from emergency services and get the help they need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        It's an iOS app powered by Hyphenate chat service
                    </strong>
                    with a very simple backend and Nexmo phone number which you can dial into
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial assumption to use websockets in conjunction with Nexmo turned out to be SUPER-time consuming and we ended up wasting 4 hours on it just to find out we won't make it in time. We decided to get rid of websockets to complete the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've built a functional iOS app MVP in less than 24 hours, we'll probably need another week to polish it to make it launchable. We're committed!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned a ton of new APIs from Nexmo and Hyphenate and other hackathon sponsors! We also learned that websocket programming does have some learning curve ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RescueApp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to launch the app after we recover from jetlag and sleep depravation ;)
