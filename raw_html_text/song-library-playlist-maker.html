                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an application that integrates apps like spotify and itunes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows you to create a playlist and play the songs for easy access. The main purpose of this app is that you can add, delete, or edit the name, artist, album, year and as long as it is not a duplicate of a name, artist, combination, the app will allow it. This allows users to easily fix incorrect songs instead of deleting a song and then re-adding it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Java and JavaFX. the front end was built using FXML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges that we ran into.
1) Making sure that songs and artist combinations are unique.
2) Figuring out how to create popups.
3) Leaving songs in alphabetical order by song name and then by artist name
4) Autoselecting a new song after one has been deleted. (for example, if you delete the first song in the list, then it should select the new first song, but if you delete the last song in a list, then it should delete the new last song)
4) Figuring out how to save songs so that when you reopen the application, it'll pull up the same playlist.
5)

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! Everything so far works well and doesn't seem to have any bugs.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out how to use JavaFX and create a user interface in java! We also learned FXML. This was the first time we used JavaFX and it was a great experience learning it.
