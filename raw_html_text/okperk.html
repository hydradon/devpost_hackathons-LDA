                    After talking to more than 80+ Instagram brands and influencers, we identified they have a serious problem when it comes to audience engagement. Sometimes their audience doesn't feel motivated to engage with their content and that could lead to lower brand visibility due to Instagram feed algorithm.

                    and these are the people who always crave to increase engagement ratio within their audience community for organic growth.

                    Why we believe our platform has a perfect growth factor to be next million-dollar startup?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just need to convert Instagram influencers to enable their profile for OkPerk loyalty and they are very much likely to get converted as we are solving their biggest problem of increasing engagement ratio of their audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once on-boarded, they do the job of promoting our platform automatically to their followers as they start rewarding their followers with Kin and loyalty points. If everything works out as we assumed, we would be able to
                    <strong>
                        grow exponentially
                    </strong>
                    in terms of userbase in no time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, our startup had earlier worked on data science in influencer and media market and had a

                        successful exit

                        With these two parameters, we believe that with the right support we will be able to grow big.

                    We learnt a lot about community engagement, Kin SDK, and viral growth effects of rewards or loyalty program. We never thought implementing cryptocurrency-based rewards program in our platform would be so simple. :)
