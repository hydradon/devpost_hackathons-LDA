                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to give low wage workers around the world a voice so that they can fearlessly share their workplace conditions in the public so that relevant engagement agencies can take relevant action. This will especially help expose those working in conditions of modern slavery, which our team believes has no place anywhere in our world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a web application we developed for SlaveFreeTrade, for workers in developing countries to share their real working conditions. Each entry by a worker will be captured by the Ethereum at the back end. Our idea can be applied to other countries/contexts in the future. The interface is designed for workers in Bangladesh as a pilot project, but the parameters could be easily adjusted for other situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS for our front end to design the form that&rsquo;ll be our webpage. 
We used node.js to connect the web page to the Ethereum blockchain platform, so that form entries can be logged into Ethereum, and workers&rsquo; feedback can be shared anonymously, immutably with all users. We used Geth as the go-implementation of the Ethereum platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too many to count. Ethereum? We had to learn to make it work with Geth. Node. js -&gt; we had to remap our whole back end towards the end as we had to change our HTML output page due to some execution errors. Sleep. We couldn't keep our eyes open all night to code, but we tried our best.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use GitHub. Leila learned about slavery conditions in Bangladesh and a lot about Ethereum. Emily learned a lot of Node.js and Will learned spelling in English.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Real
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to create a user friendly interface that displays Ethereum output for SlaveFreeTrade's partner agencies like &amp;Wider to use. Also want to create a SMS based input user interface that'll be more easily accessible to low-pay workers without internet access.
