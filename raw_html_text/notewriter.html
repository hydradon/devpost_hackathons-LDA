                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that utilized computer vision and we thought, "what better application for computer vision and text processing than converting messy, handwritten notes to well-formatted typed notes?" Every college student has had those few teachers who don't allow laptops in their classes, and while that might be helpful for studying at times, sometimes you want to have your notes all in one place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It utilizes the Microsoft Computer Vision API to process an image the user uploads, interpreting the handwritten text and transcribing it into computer text. The app writes out the data to a file and pushes the file as a word document to Google Drive.
                </p>
