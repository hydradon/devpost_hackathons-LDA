                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every time my friend sees that my chrome book's screen is in a monochrome-kind of filter, they always come up with a sad story to go along with it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the only fully implemented things in the game are your player and the Pituite ( the fire-like slime ). The demo is FULLY compatible with a Xbox controller, not any others. For the keyboard, the arrow keys are to move and the 'C' key is to sprint. For the controller, use the joystick to move and the 'A' key to sprint. Other monsters are placeholders or not fully added. If you have figured out how to sprint through the walls, nice! This is meant to happen as future planned levels will contain puzzles in which you have to escape to get to the story.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Game Maker Studio (Found on steam), I was able to mess around for a bit without actually starting my project. Thankfully, I was able to code without using the Studio's built-in pre-programmed buttons! This was made with the help of my friends and my partner for making this, my sister.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were multiple challenges that I was faced with. For example: Xbox controllers not working, Keyboard controls not working, continuously running off of the face of the map without anywhere else to go while sprinting. All were resolved.

                <p>
                    I am EXTREMELY proud of the fact that I could accomplish what I did do. I usually just try practicing some small bits of code like how to make a ball move to the other side on it's on; simple things. I never thought I would be able to

                    I learned that things like this takes time. Especially when you have to care for yourself and your needs.

                    What's next for Coma - Discoloration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing for Coma, which I hope to turn into a series of games later on in my life, is the story. You play as a young girl named Grace who has been in an accident. She's in a coma, slowly fading into death and trying to figure out what happened and if there is a cure.
