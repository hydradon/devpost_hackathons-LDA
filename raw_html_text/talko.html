                </h2>

                    Talko is a Chrome extension which lets you natively follow links, move around webpages, and search Bing in Chrome with just your voice. We're aiming to make the web more accessible by creating a lightweight and streamlined solution. We used the Bing Speech API from the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services suite to power our speech recognition processes, and coded the extension in Javascript, HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we do it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our command processes emulate natural language and logic by enabling multi-step functions-- for example, telling Talko what you'd like to search for takes you directly to your Bing search results, rather than pausing at the Bing home page, or saying that you'd like to search for a job takes you directly to Dice's homepage and a download link to their app. We are able to process advanced speech by leveraging Microsoft's Bing Speech API. We also emphasize a tailored user experience, in which installation is a breeze, animations/highlighting instantly provide feedback to users, and the learning curve is almost non-existent with intuitive commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why we're here
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given that over 50 million Americans face the challenges of limited mobility every day, Talko has the potential to solve a real, tangible problem with the one thing people spend the majority of their lives on -- the internet. While most computers are equipped with some voice commands, these are clunky and awkward, limited in functionality, expensive, and fail to support any sort of native web navigation. We're committed to making the web accessible, inclusive, and empowering for everyone.
