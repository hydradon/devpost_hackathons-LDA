                    Inspiration &amp; pitch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Consider the following scenario: you buy new clothes, and you cut away the laundry labels (typically they are located at the neck or close to the waist and make you feel uncomfortable.) You have a vague feeling that you will need to remember how to wash the clothes, but looking at the symbols you realize that you understand absolutely nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Discouraged, you just throw the labels away, and risk damaging your clothes next time you do laundry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With
                    <strong>
                        wshhh
                    </strong>
                    , your entire wardrobe (and the associated laundry labels) are easy to navigate and understand! It's as easy as 1-2:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Take a pic of the clothing itself
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take a pic of the label
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Our computer vision algorithm takes care of extracting the relevant laundry information from the label, and makes it available through a convenient interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the frontend, we built a HTML5 app that uses the WebRTC API to access the device's camera (whether a smartphone or a computer).
The interface is built using the Materialize library, which ensures that the app scales well to diverse screen sizes and has a modern look and feel.
In the backend, we process and analyze the pictures using OpenCV. The pipeline includes histogram equalization, template matching with normalized cross-correlation and image alignment with SIFT features.
We match common symbols, and store the results in a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matching symbols was harder than we expected - laundry labels are very diverse and usually very small (it is therefore difficult to get good pictures of them), and there is no standard computer vision solution for this task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We managed to build a working proof of concept!
