                    <li>
                        This application was inspired by the need for users to sign up for events and plan their itinerary for the event.

                    <li>
                        Currently, users can register and login to the application and view a list of upcoming events on their "My Account" page. Currently, users can only sign up for events and view the events they are signed up for. In the future, we plan to extend the application to send notifications to users before the event and allow them to sign up for sub-events of the main event.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We built the application using Flask and Python with Sqlite as a database.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We ran into challenges with the Bootstrap integration with Flask so we were not able to properly style our application.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a working app that allows users to sign in or register and view events is something we are proud of. Also, their is admin functionality so an administrative user can log in to the application and manage users and events. Administrators can edit user or event information or add new events.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We learned to choose tools carefully, especially when under time constraints. Flask with Python had many problems that cost us significant time in development. In the future, we would choose to use a more robust application framework such as Rails. 
## What's next for Event Scheduling App
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next we plan to extend the application and use it to schedule events for Penn State Brandywine, such as conferences and possibly future hackathons. The finished application will be a useful tool for users to schedule events they are interested in, and will be useful for Penn State students to see upcoming events and sign up for them.
