                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As access to energy grows in the developing world, this opens up opportunities for entrepreneurial communities, to buy and sell electricity. With current systems it&rsquo;s hard for people to monetise their electricity assets without a framework to buy and sell.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have designed a decentralised electricity market that leverages the core technology behind BitCoin, called the blockchain . This technology has a few cool features. In particular, it lets you trade stuff, without a central authority, and trust that everything is above board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this blockchain infrastructure in place, communities can eventually have the opportunity to leapfrog the developed world and establish a true decentralised smart grid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed a simple online interface to simulate the type of decentralised electricity market we would deploy and illustrate the effects of supply and demand increases on the price of electricity being traded.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coordinating a diverse team and effectively allocating tasks to achieve our goals in such a short time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of our use of blockchains to help microgrids in developing countries. We also really like our webpage which illustrates our concept in such a simple way.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned heaps about the additional types of requirements and considerations that need to be taken into account when we are talking about microgrids.
