                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of distracting ourselves by news feeds and pictures of people far away from us, we want to spark new connections between people who are right next to us on the train, waiting for their flight at the terminal, looking for teammates at a hackathon, etc.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lets you know if people in your immediate area are open to talk and how to approach them. Using geolocation services, the app lets you know which people near you are open to talk. By looking at their profile picture, you will hopefully recognize them in person sitting near by. Their profile will give you their first name and the best way to approach them, like a topic they enjoy talking about.

                    Using location services. Trying to understand and use AWS DynamoDB consumed most of our time and led nowhere :(
