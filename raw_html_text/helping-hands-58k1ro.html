                <p>
                    Poor handwriting is a major source of insecurity for many people. Children with poor handwriting often struggle in school because of stigma from instructors and extra effort required to write legibly. Corrective therapy is expensive, and not all families can afford it.

                        Helping Hands

                    uses augmented reality and mobile technologies to help children and adults of all ability levels improve their handwriting and motor skills through practice and visual feedback.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an Android app in Java with Google ARCore. Python and ImageMagick were on the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no experience with AR, so we spent a lot of time learning how to use ARCore. Additionally, ARCore is a new SDK for Android, so there are fewer resources available for learning. Because we spent so much time learning the technology, we weren't able to complete a working project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Android development both through working with the framework and attending the lectures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to effectively narrow down the wide breadth of ideas that our team initially had. Once we narrowed down, we learned how to foster customer delight effectively. In particular, it was very interesting learning about how augmented reality works internally as well as how 3D models are constructed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Helping Hands
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time, we would perfect the AR technology and finish the features we ideated. In particular, finding the best way to place a 2D image on a surface in the background. After this, we could add more words and sentences to our stencil catalog. In the future, we could add functionality to AR smart glasses.
