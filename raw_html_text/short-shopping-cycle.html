                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Locating items in a store takes a lot of time. An instore navigation system will save considerable amount of time for the customers. So we decided to implement an application that finds the optimal path given the shopping list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application gets the shopping list either through a text query or speech recognition and navigates user to the shortest path.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have implemented a web interface that is based on Javascript and Jquery. Also, we utilized chrome APIs to add speech recognition feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The optimization algorithm was difficult to implement in first place. Moreover, designing the user interface is the time consuming part.
                </p>
