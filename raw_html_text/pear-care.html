                </h2>
                <p>
                    The overarching goal of Pear Care is to provide a support structure within which patients will feel more motivated to pursue personal wellness goals, including (but not limited to) general fitness, mental health, sleep quality, proper consumption of prescribed medicine, as well as any goals that the patient might consider important. In the status quo, it is difficult for most outpatients to maintain focus on wellness goals, especially as they are confronted with the stresses and rigors of everyday life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We see this as a particularly significant issue in pediatric patients, who are often left unattended throughout the day as they go to school and then return home before their parents are available to give them direct attention. Thus, Pear Care provides a system by which patients (both the parents and the children) in a &ldquo;Care Family&rdquo; can keep each other accountable to their own personal health goals. This is facilitated by a peer reminder system, where each member of the Care Family is expected to follow up on a specific member in the case where they have not achieved their daily goals. Essentially, this system serves as a feedback loop, wherein members can keep each other focused on their own wellness. The matching of members to one another is regularly changed, so as to avoid alarm fatigue and to ameliorate the apparent social cost of reporting symptoms as they are experienced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further, the regular stream of updated health and wellness information (e.g. sleep tracking, weight tracking, medication tracking, mental health tracking, etc.) allows patients to interact with their physicians from the comfort of their home, extending the reach of the medical team at the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. The monitoring system can be configured for simple weekly summaries as well as alerts in cases of sudden departures from the norm, facilitating earlier intervention by both members of the Care Family and by medical professionals.
