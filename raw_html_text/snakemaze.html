                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its inspired by the age old popular Snake Game we have played since the Nokia 'not-breaking' phone age.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So this project will use Project Tango to detect the surroundings and create a maze of the room for the player. So its his maze. Also, he will be the snake while playing so its his hiss. Food will be placed along his way. He has to eat it and any collision with the room furniture or walls will be a crash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Unity and having C# codes in it. We decided on this idea yesterday after looking at an idea which didn't work out so we were unable to complete it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced A LOT OF CHALLENGES. We generally write down all situations beforehand and detect how to overcome them. How to detect the furniture? How to differentiate it from furniture? How will the snake position be relative to camera? We HAVE NEVER USED UNITY OR GOOGLE TANGO. Plus, no time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel we came up with an innovative idea and had the urge to learn something new. We learned both the new languages as much as we could. We faced certain challenges in the beginning but we didn't give up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt that that there is so much to learn! We learnt Unity and snake game functioning.
                </p>

                    What's next for SnakeMaze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There can be loads of additions such as jumping food, bouncing furniture etc.
