                    Bulletinboard is created as a solution to the ever-persistent problem of not having a comprehensive list of events for each day at different schools, particularly Stetson University. This project aims to give access to each Organization's Presidents so that they themselves can upload events that their organizations are hosting for all the students to see. We're also planning to add an option for students to RSVP to the event later on.
