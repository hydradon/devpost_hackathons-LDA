                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that anyone can use AFK for chrome. Whether it be for accessibility reasons -- such as for those with disabilities that can't use the keyboard -- or for daily use when you're cooking, our aim was to make scrolling and Chrome browsing easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app AFK (away from keyboard) helps users scroll and read, hands off. You can control the page by saying "go down/up", "open/close tab", "go back/forward", "reload/refresh", or reading the text on the page (it will autoscroll once you reach the bottom).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stack overflow and lots of panicked googling -- we also used Mozilla's web speech API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulties scraping the text from sites for the reading function as well as some difficulty integrating the APIs into our extension. We started off with a completely different idea and had to pivot mid-hack. This cut down a lot of our time, and we had troubles re-organizing and gauging the situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, as a team, we all worked on contributing parts to the project and, in the end we were able to create a working product despite the small road bumps we ran into.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we were able to learn how to make chrome extensions in 24 hours :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned chrome extensions, using APIs in the extension and also had some side adventures with vue.js and vuetify for webapps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AFK
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to include other functionalities like taking screen shots and taking notes with the voice.
