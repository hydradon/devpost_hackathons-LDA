                </h2>
                <p>
                    RateMyProfessor is subject to response biases - students normally comment about their professors when they fail a class or love the professor. By summarizing professor's ratings, we can reduce the amount of outliers in the rating of a professor in order to give students a more accurate depiction of that professor.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows the user to select a professor and generates a summary of that professor, based on that professor's RateMyProfessor profile.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user selects an option from the drop-down menu in the website we built, using React. A python script then scrapes the web to aggregate reviews on RateMyProfessor, which are then passed to other methods which use NLP to tokenize and create a summary from the reviews.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be simple to pass a string from Javascript to a Python script, but this task proved very difficult and tedious - you need to push to a database and access that database with the server. To circumvent this, we had to limit the number of professors available and only offer the user a drop-down menu, rather than inputting the professor's name. Had we been able to implement server access, then the user would have been able to access any professor from any school.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new technologies - we implemented a lot of software (a user front end, a python web-scraping script, and NLP sentiment analysis) in order to create a cool project.

                    See above - a myriad of new technologies.
