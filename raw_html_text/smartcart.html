                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we are inspired by necessity to start cooking as we began our lives independent people. Cooking became a passion for us and we soon realized that this application needed to be created. This was through the repeated amount of failures of not having the proper food items ready to cook.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SmartCart is a cross platform application that is designed to connect the world of recipes online to your devices. SmartCart starts off with a Chrome Extension that saves web page ingredients of a recipe and adds all the items to a cart. In the cart, it is compared to Walmart's API to estimate the total cost it would take to prepare the recipe.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SmartCart can be divided into three essential parts. The first part is the Chrome Extension that triggers the application to save a webpage's recipe information on a server. This is coded in Javascript. The server itself is written in Python and scrapes the website information for ingredient details, while connected to Firebase API and Walmart API for price information. Meanwhile, the web application is coded in AngularJS.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each recipe website is formatted very differently and scraping this is very difficult.
