                    RChain is a relatively new cryptocurrency that promises to solve the scalability problems currently faced by Bitcoin and Ethereum through the adoption of a new computational paradigm termed rho-calculus. As opposed to most modern programming languages based on lambda calculus (which emphasizes type safety and computability), the Rholang language used by RChain is based on its self termed rho calculus (which emphasizes asynchronous computing and event driven execution). Since it's a relatively new protocol with a relatively new community, no tipbot exists as of yet for their subreddit, even though their project proposal is quite unique and highly interesting. Thus, my project goal is write a reddit tipbot for their subreddit to spread awareness and usage for RChain.

                    The rough goal for this project will be:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Develop a reddit bot utilizing python and PRAW
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Setup a mongodb to store transaction data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Debug and test on parity and geth nodes on the Ropsten testnet
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        (Stretch goal) Create a docker container and host on the cloud
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I plan to continue working on this tipbot after this hackathon is over, so please keep an eye out on /r/RChain for future updates!
                </p>
