                    Inspiration - We wanted to create a program that randomly generates mathematically calculated music based off of given images.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How it works - Given an image, PicTone will analyze all of the pixels to determine the probability of each gradient of color, and will randomly generate a series of notes to depict such a color.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - We ran into problems with using the Android Studios to create an app for this program.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - We are all proud of the creativity of this program that is able to convert visual representations into musical ones.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - We re-enforced our newly learned skills of replicating sounds and utilizing reference type objects.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PicTone - PicTone will eventually be able to determine the cohesiveness of the image (how uniformly spread each of the colors are) in order to depict the overall smoothness of the musical passage.
