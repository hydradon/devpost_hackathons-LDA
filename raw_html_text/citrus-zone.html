                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On our way to a one-week capacity building training in the Central Region, we came across a heap of oranges for about a 100KM stretch of the road. On our return, these oranges were still there and had started going bad. On questioning residents in the area, they informed us they lacked access to ready market and are forced to sell the produce at cheaper prices than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Company therefore seeks to become the "middle-men" that links these farmers to buyers and vice versa using the USSD model.
                </p>
