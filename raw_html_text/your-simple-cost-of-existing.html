                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built as the first part of an idea to reduce avoidant attitudes towards budgeting, saving, and objectively observing costs of living in young people by equating potentially abstract monetary costs to items present in everyday life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For any amount of money, this will figure out how much that chunk of cash is in terms of bubble tea, McDoubles, AirPods, or your hard-earned Western degree.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML5 and the patient assistance of kind people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this in two hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With very little previous knowledge of html5, this was built in less than two hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot more from the workshops that I spent most of my day attending but a lot about image sizing, text formatting, and positioning
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for your simple cost of existing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More items and flexibility with calculations
                </p>
