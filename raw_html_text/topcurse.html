                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The midnight thought that one of the main pain points with top is that it's hard to keep track of how the most CPU-heavy processes are changing over time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays various system statistics (top-like listing of processes, disk transfers, network transfers, memory paging &amp; swapping), including a line graph of the CPU usage by the listed processes. While not as in-depth as top or netstat or other traditional system monitoring tools, TopCurse aims to provide a quick overview of all basic system statistics at a single glance in 80x24 terminal
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With python, ncurses, and various system utilities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ncurses is a rather peculiar library in many ways, so interfacing with it presented some difficulties
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The visualization is neat, information-dence, and easily readable
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More about ncurses, as well as the various system monitoring utilities in OS X
                </p>
