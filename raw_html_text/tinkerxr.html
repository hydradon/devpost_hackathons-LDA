                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all VR advocates and wanted to create an immersive, educational experience for people that may not have access to the hardware to build robots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TinkerXR is an app to help individuals learn to code robots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The WebVR component was created in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating snap drop zones was really challenging. We wanted to provide the opportunity for users to design a robot and actually code it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working as a team and being able to bring many technologies together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    \We learned how to use Spark AR and we also learned how to have a Web VR interact with a React Web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TinkerXR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We add more programmable parts, a richer language, better user interaction and optimize the web page.
