                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being college students ourselves, we have faced the situation of leftover meal swipes a lot of times. We did not know what to do with the extra  meal swipes. This introduced us to the idea of making a platform to share those leftover meal swipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects students having extra meal swipes with students who need one. The person who wants to share has an option to set a price and post it in the app. This request is sent to the users who need meal swipes and the request goes off when someone accepts it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using android studio. The back-end was designed on Microsoft Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being our first time working with android studio, we were learning on the fly as well as implementing it. It took us a while to implement the databases.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make a working app within the time allotted.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>

                    What's next for Swipe a Person
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going forward, we will try to implement more features to this app like secure login authorization and launch it in our campus. Also, we will make it iOS compatible.
