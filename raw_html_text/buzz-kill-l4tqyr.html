                    PROJECT NAME
Killing the buzz with a squirt of gas and a single zap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DEFINE THE PROBLEM YOU ARE SEEKING TO SOLVE:
In accordance with one of the two problem statements provided:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our device aims to reduce the population of mosquitoes in densely populated urban areas, especially those areas at the University classed as &ldquo;Hot Spots&rdquo; for mosquito attacks. 
Whilst our devices aim is not health aspect related, lessening the nuisance and attacks by mosquito will help to reduce the health risks associated with this vector.
Buzz Kill does NOT want to eradicate this animal rather control its population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DESCRIBE YOUR BIG IDEA:
The BIG idea is to be able to walk through the University and into any building and not be under attack by mosquitoes. Essentially, if this product worked, it would become a household staple in areas with high (or any) mosquito population.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DESCRIBE AND ILLUSTRATE:
The aim of our device is to mimic the factors of the host (typically humans and small animals), that attract mosquitoes. These factors include but are not limited to warmth and carbon dioxide, both of which will be used in the experimental phase and with adequate performance and results, in the final prototype. 
Using the design of the classic bug zapper, the light is replaced with a CO2 cylinder similar to that of a soda stream carbonator. Utilizing technology closely to that of the Airwick&copy; freshmatics, carbon dioxide will be dispersed into the air as a slow release. 
A separate cylinder, will emit heat into the atmosphere to mimic body temperature. Both these elements will then be encased in a wire mesh that will have an electric current running through it to provide the &ldquo;zap&rdquo; when the mosquito enters to feed.
To remain eco and environmentally friendly, each unit will be solar powered with a battery backup to maintain during nightfall or in areas of dense bushland cover.
The protype set up can be seen below. The design is easy to maintain and clean with removable screw top lid and bottom. Cannisters are expected to last 30 days with setting on low intensity spraying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHAT IS THE CORE FOUNDATION OF YOUR RESEARCH OR SOLUTION:
The core foundation of our device is what is already available on the market. At this present time, the only device available for mosquito control in an elimination sense, are bug zapper used simultaneously with mosquito attraction pads. These are not safe for use in ecosystems where insects are an important part of the foodchains. Together, with research on mosquitoes, ecosystems and the effectiveness of bug zappers we have reached our idea above.
DESCRIBE WHO YOU THINK YOUR END USER AND/OR PAYING CUSTOMER WOULD BE:
Our end user and/or paying customers would be those prone to mosquito populations. These are people who live in bushland or near bodies of water, particularly those stagnant such as swamps, ponds, pools and dams. 
As an easy to use, maintain and clean device our targeted demographic is that of people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DESCRIBE YOUR TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVEL OR RESEARCH LITERATURE LEVEL:
As university students, we are required to understand, dissect and relay research information every semester. With engineering, our degree provides us with a technology readiness for industry. If provided with funding, we would be able to construct our devices with academic reasoning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TOP 3 HYPOTHESIS:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide and warmth on a live host, they will also be attracted to carbon dioxide and warmth on non-living body.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A bug zapper without light, will not attract any birds, bees, insects or flies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our device, placed on low dispersal of carbon dioxide, will last +30 days before action is required (i.e. maintenance or replacements)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Hypothesis 1:
Testing: To test this hypothesis, mosquitoes the device will be set up without the electrical wiring. A sticky surface will be placed around the cannisters. At different times of the day the device will be on, with the number of mosquitoes counted and compared.
If successful component will be used in prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hypothesis 2:
Testing: A bug zapper will be placed into the environment, without the wiring or light attached. The warmth cylinder will be on. A video recorder will be placed on the device to record the activity towards the device.
If under 10 instances or activities with wildlife occur, this test will be deemed successful and the prototype can be continued with a warmth element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hypothesis 3:
Testing: To test this hypothesis, we will take the cannister of carbon dioxide and place it into the release cannister. At the end of each week (7 days) we will test to see if it still emits carbon dioxide. At the end of 25 days, it will be tested again. If the cannister useable after 30 days then this experiment will be deemed successful. If successful, then the dispenser can be used and seen as a potential selling point due to low replacement and maintenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HOW WOULD WE USE THE FUNDING TO PROGRESS OUR HYPOTHESIS:
Funding would go a long way in testing the above hypothesis. Current bug zappers can be as cheap as $25AUD per unit, with estimated cost of:
&bull; $50 for the carbon dioxide and dispenser components
&bull; $25 for wiring and battery packs
&bull; $100 for solar installation and panel/s 
&bull; $25 for thermal cylinder
This means for approx. $225AUD all three hypothesis could be tested at least once.
During these testing phases, each component will be deemed successful or not successful based on individual performance and then together as one device.
Funding would also enable Buzz Kill to purchase the materials needed in bulk to bring manufacturing costs down to a fraction of the price. Our aim is to have each device cost $75 or less to produce as a DIY, with factory manufacturing obviously being less than this. A 20% lead way will be provided if costs exceed this $75AUD budget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If funding was allocated to team Buzz Kill within:
Month 1:
&bull; All CAD drawings would be finalized
&bull; Materials purchased
Month 2:
&bull; All hypothesis explored, tested and altered if needed.
Month 3:
&bull; First prototype built and tested in Australia
&bull; Second prototype built and tested in Malawi, Africa (due to existing internship and severe mosquito problems in Africa) (also provides an alternative environment to test prototype,(diversity))
Month 4:
&bull; Alterations to design if needed
Month 5:
&bull; Minimum of 20 units available for consumer testing and review
Month 6:
&bull; Marketable product
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our design isn't unconventional but it is a creative play on already existing products that can be manipulated and adapted for use in different situations. Being able to change something or improve upon already existing and working products is key to solving problems such as this one in a financially viable and timely manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will be the first challenge for each of us. Please find the video link below of our team leader briefly explaining our proposal and use of funding.
