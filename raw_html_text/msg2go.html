                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something create something interesting for our first time using Android-Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By sending a late text, you'll never miss that happy birthday wish or that important event reminder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By researching online, we discovered how to send texts utilizing android-studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we decided to create an android-wear heat attack detection app. This app consisted of 3 main areas. The heart rate sensor, the text features and a quiz that can diagnose high risk patients for a heart attack. We were unable to utilize the android-wear's heart rate sensor in the allotted time, as a result, we pivoted to a delayed text messaging service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our ability to pivot an ambitious idea into something that was feasible, and we're also proud of stepping outside of our comfort zones and opting to program into an IDE we are unfamiliar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studios development, working with the IDE in Android wear as well as SMS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MSG2GO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to update the app with aestheically pleasing visuals. As well as a personal account associated with the app's features.
