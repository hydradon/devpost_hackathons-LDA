                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever since I saw Windows Hello, I wanted to bring the same technology to other features that I often use and Facebook is definitely one of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It captures an image of your face and compares it to an image of you to see if the right user is using the computer
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first fiddled with Microsoft Facial Recognition API and created a python script that uses the front camera of the laptop to capture an image and compares to an image of the user already on the system. We then created a Chrome Extension that would allow us to choose to log into Facebook using Facial Recognition.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble working with http get request because we were new to JavaScript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we came out of LA Hacks with a product to present because to be honest, we did not think that we could finish this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about JavaScript, especially about HTTP GET and POST requests, which can be used to request API in order to do awesome things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Facebook Facial Recognition Login
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to try to improve the application so that it works on multiple platforms and not just macbook computers. We also want it to be more secure and also to work with other websites other than Facebook!
