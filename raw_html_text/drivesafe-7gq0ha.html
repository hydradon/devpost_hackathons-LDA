                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created a SMS application linked to the Automatic dataset to notify drivers when and where they experienced a hard brake incident and remind themselves to practice safe driving on the road!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user sends a text "BRAKE" to a designated telephone number.  After the user types the the text BRAKE, he or she gets a text response asking if he or she wants more detail of any Hard Brake event in certain time period.  After he or she texts back to a request for more information, the server returns any data associated with any hard brake incident.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built using the Twilio API and as well as the dummy Automatic dataset.  I also used webscript.io using Lua to implement the backend of the web service for the SMS web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a challenge integrating Automatic's Webhook Api with Twilio API and webscript.io
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am happy that I was to create a simple, yet useful application for the Transportation community to build on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of Automatic API and Webhook and importance this technology will have to improve smart driving for San Francisco Bay Area drivers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hard_Brake_Notification:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To integrate the SMS application with Automatic API (WebHook) so that when the car is turned off and driver experienced a Hard Brake event, a text message is send to him or her about the details of the incident and remind him or her to practice safe driving on the road.
