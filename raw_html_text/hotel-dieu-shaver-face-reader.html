                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A patient can not move their legs and arms? No worries! We got this face recognition software for you! As long as the patient can rotate their head a bit, the cursor can be moved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    control a circle(cursor) to move as what the patient wanted and reduce the work of caregivers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using pycharm, to import opencv and python to work with a pre-trained machine learning face recognition algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The face recognition algorithms are not too stable which have about 10% failure rate toward the output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned the so many about opencv and combine the knowledge of machine learning, python, and opencv together to form a project that can actually help patients that are not able to move their bodies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowledge of opencv, tensorflow, google cloud. As well as the current lack of health care on the recovery of patients.
                </p>

                    What's next for hotel dieu shaver face reader
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use a different AI face training algorithm.
