                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team member&rsquo;s, Tayyaba, had a close friend who suffered from severe panic anxiety. After seeing him struggle for months and years with failure of treatment due to little amount of data available during his panic attacks, him and his family were disheartened on the progress. Many individuals suffering from anxiety, especially during a panic attack, forget majority of the events that occur during the attack immediately or a short time after the occurrence. The reason behind that is Cortisol, a hormone, is released when your body is under stress. It is known to prevent the ability of forming memories. This makes it very hard for patients to be able to specifically tell their doctors how long their attack lasted or the extreme reaction of their body to the most accurate degree, which in return slows down the recovery process. You can&rsquo;t evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment, whether that is therapy or medicine, without having a data of the process. This is where Cura came into the picture.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cura is a bracelet device which logs the status of patients on a constant loop. The patient will first get a bracelet, then he/she will go online and log in the device and fill out basic information (name, phone number, sex, weight, and height), finally they will proceed to wear the device for 24 hours. During these 24 hours, Cura will measure the patient&rsquo;s average heartbeat/pulse, perspiration levels, muscle movement, and temperature. Each sensor will then be set to a average number with a threshold. If for at least two sensors, the recorded number goes below or above this number at any point, a red light will turn on in the bracelet. When this loop is broken, there is also an alert given to the web app. The web app then starts storing all the information till all sensor readings return to normal. During this process, all caregivers are also notified by text, the other login option on the website.

                    How we built it &amp; Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to build the basics of the bracelet using Arduino. Since we were missing two of the four sensors, this made our circuit a bit incomplete. Hence we decided to try to code for just the two sensors instead and show our method behind it because it would be applied similarly for the other two sensors. We weren&rsquo;t able to figure out how to find the averages of for all the devices.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to get a basic layout for the website down along with code two of the four sensors. While not ideal, we can still base the other two on previous work. For the website, we had never coded before so to be able to build it from scratch was a challenging but rewarding experience. Coding in C, for Arduino, was difficult and we hit many roadblocks, we got it to work which was something our team was very proud. We are also happy we were able to have an outline for an actual product which we can work on beyond the hackathon.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a great learning experience in learning two coding languages (C and HTML/CSS), wiring for Arduino, team work, and time management
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cura
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were to develop Cura further, our next steps would be to insert the other sensors for pulse and perspiration. We would also need to scale everything down so the system can fit inside a small bracelet. With bluetooth technology available, we can also develop a system that records data in real time and provides an accurate description of panic attacks and notifications to family members, friends and doctors of the user.
