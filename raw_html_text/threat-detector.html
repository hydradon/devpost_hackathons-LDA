                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After watching the Afero demonstration workshop at MenloHacks, we seeked out Mr. Amberg who worked with Afero and worked with him to create a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a range sensor, people can detect proximity to certain objects and detect if there is a threat near them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected the Afero board to a plinto, which was plugged into an Arduino. An ultrasonic range sensor was connected to a breadboard with wires running through. By plugging in an LCD screen to relay text and processing code inside the Arduino, we were able to create a threat detector.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started this project with no experience with Afero boards, and none of our members have ever touched an Arduino. However, with the help of Mr. Amberg, we learnt about how Afero boards work and how to create IoT's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we could do this whole project without any prior experience and formulate a new idea on the spot for our hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt about IoT's and how they operate, as well as the Afero board, and experimentation with the Arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Threat Detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to use the Afero technology in other applications that can help others with hackathons and projects, as well as in the industrial world.
