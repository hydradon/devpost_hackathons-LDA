                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the aging population of the UK turns into an inverted period, Dementia becomes more and more of a pressing issue. The time consuming nature of Dementia Questionnaires in a time where General Practice Surgeries are constrained with time and resources, promotes need for more efficient way of screening.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Removes the need for human interaction to do 20-30 minute questionnaire, saving time for the GP, translated to improved efficiency in services. Questionnaire will be done before GP appointment for annual medication review, Results will be available to be discussed during the GP appointment. It will demonstrate the likely hood/ risk of having dementia,  promoting GP to conduct detailed clinical examination to confirm diagnosis.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Questionnaire written to AWS RDS. Lambda queries RDS and passes questionnaire to Amazon Alexa. Alexa speaks out question and listens to response. and writes response to RDS. Express app on EC2 queries RDS for response and presents result on web app.. (In theory)
