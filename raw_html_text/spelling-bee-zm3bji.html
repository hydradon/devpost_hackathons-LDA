                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a tool for teachers to utilize when they are unable to give every student their full intention. On top this, we personally wanted to explore the field of development for Alexa Skills
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Alexa Skill will prompt the user if they would like to play a spelling game. It then, selects a random word from a large selection of words that range in difficulty from 1st to 8th. Then it checks to see if the user spelt the chosen word correctly and congratulates them if they spelt it correctly or prompt them to try again otherwise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the Alexa Skill Kit included in the Amazon Development Console and the Lambda Management Console included in the Amazon Web Services to develop and host the code for our Alexa Skill
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us knew any information about developing Alexa Skills going into this project. Specifically, we had difficulties understanding how the JSON files translated into Python code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we were proud that we were able to actually develop a working Alexa Skill. Also, we that we were able to learn all the information for developing an Alexa Skill in the amount of time given for the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a considerable amount of JSON formatting as well as how the Alexa Skill Kit and Amazon Lambda function actually interact.
