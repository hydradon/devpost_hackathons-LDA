                    What it does: When Mood Screen is launched, your screen will become tinted based on the time of day and the movement of your mouse.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: Mood Screen was programmed in java.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: We were challenged with downloading an IDE and making it possible to click through the color tint.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We're proud that we managed to produce anything at all.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned how to use listeners, window handlers, intelliJ, Libraries, Maven, Importing libraries into IntelliJ, how to exit a frame, interacting with the operating system is not easy, what JNA is, Robot class and a brief history of com.sun.AWTUtilities
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mood Screen: Our plan for Mood Screen is to have smoother implementation of the redraw/clicking feature and have an option to track battery power, CPU usage, RAM usage, volume and fan speed.
