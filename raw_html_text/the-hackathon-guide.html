                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't really have much experience before this event, so if a guide had existed, I would definitely use it.
                </p>

                    Just states tips and tricks for the event

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Repl.it HTML and CSS, using the workshops and w3schools
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My entire team, who didn't help at all, left and went home early. I had to do this from scratch. (Also, I didn't start until about 3 hours ago)
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Continuing to code without my entire team, finishing on time, creating a decent website, considering my abilities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot from the workshops (Animation, the Cloud, Embedding etc)
                </p>

                    What's next for The Hackathon Guide
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding live updates from real "hackers" around the world (i.e. allowing users to also add their own tips based on their own experiences) (Basically like a global hacking community for tips)
