                <p>
                    We believe that every foreign born individual is an asset to our community and want to help them succeed.  However, accomplishing our own personal goals within American financial, legal, and educational systems can be intimidating and difficult, especially for people not born in this country.  Immigrants and refugees may wish to open a business or apply for a loan. Achieving these milestones may feel like climbing a tall ladder, Our app helps users create their own goal plans where each goal is curated with objectives from foreign assistance organizations.  By reducing the overwhelming amount of work into manageable curated objectives, we will enable foreign born individuals to gradually climb the ladder, one rung at a time, until they reach their personal goals.  With the support of our application and foreign assistance organizations, we can ensure that every foreign-born individual succeeds at climbing their own personal ladder.
