                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I was getting into tech and learning how to code I began to notice that there are lots of online resources to learn coding, but very little help with where to start or what to do with that knowledge. I wanted to foster a space where people could have access to a code compiler/debugger, as well as suggested real life projects that people want to see happen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website provides user profiles, educational tools, forums, and an embedded debugger IDE (OnlineGDB) all in one place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Wordpress plugins, and did lots of editing/customizing source code for our own needs. It now looks and functions almost entirely differently from theme started with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with four members, ended with two.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product really works and looks much nicer than any other project we've submitted in Hack-a-thons before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Wordpress, communicating about specific code with a team of people. We also got practice with php and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for So, Whats Next?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So...Whats Next? Next steps would be connecting Github and LinkdIn to user profiles, and getting more in depth with educational resources.
