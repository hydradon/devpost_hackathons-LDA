                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to be able to set the led color scheme on the k70 keyboard dynamically, and built this application to allow users to effortlessly generate new color schemes from video input from the webcam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It implements an abstract keyboard implementation over the k70 key mappings, and generates new color schemes of whatever video stream the camera sends back while the user is holding the left mouse button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to use the a python k70 CUE API wrapper and good old python to build it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program was difficult to optimize to catch input, and the video stream had to be dynamically pixelated in order to be mapped onto the much coarser keyboard resolution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of getting it to work despite going off in the wrong directions multiple times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to interface with making calls to low level hardware to change pixel colors.
                </p>

                    What's next for ScreenBoard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to introduce threads to speed up the pixelization algorithm with parallelization.
