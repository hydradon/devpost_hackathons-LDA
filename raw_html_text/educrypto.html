                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Children are spending a lot of time on things that do not benefit them intellectually. Our belief is that if we stop spending time on things that don't benefit us and the society, we could collectively achieve more than what we have now. We believe it is crucial to start young, and make good practices such as learning a habit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are working on Ethereum tokens for Crypto collectibles similar to CryptoKitties. The core idea is to motivate and give incentive to young children to complete online learning as leisure activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We seek to capitalise on the human psychology that makes Crypto collectible a success for a good cause. The sense of owning something uniquely rare and the addiction towards the thrill of unpredictability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the children completed a small online course, they will get a unique Crypto collectible. The one and only way to generate a new unique never seen before collectible is by completing courses.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by writing a Solidity contract for Ethereum ERC721 non fungible crypto token, set up Truffle, Ganache and Metamask for testing. After making sure that the Ethereum contract is functional, we created simple web pages and link them to the contract and Metamask wallet. Finally, we compile using Truffle CLI, then deploy the application on local browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are not a lot of resources on how to create and deploy ERC721 token. It was hard to grasp the concept of how the token works as well. Two of our members are less well versed in programming and found it to be challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully deployed the Ethereum contract using Metamask API on the web browser after multiple unsuccessful attempts. We now have a better understanding on how Ethereum token works and how to implement them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to deploy Ethereum smart contracts from workshops and mentors who are expert in the area.

                    What's next for EduCrypto
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We seek to replace micro credentials and official certification for adults as well. It is more transparent, reliable, and difficult to forge due to the proof of authority required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PS. WIX is the proposed web design.
