                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by other mindfulness apps and the services they provide
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you enter the app, you tell the app what you want from it. If you need to relax, you would enter a controlled breathing session where every time the circles expand you inhale, hold your breath if stagnant, and exhale and they shrink. If you need to do effective work, we provide a timer for pomodoro which is a method for focused work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using tinkter and pygame
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to get the circles to work was challenging in fully understanding the framework of tkinter. Also getting the 'relaxing gif animation' to work so that the music would line up with the animation to relax the user. Trying to get the music to work with the GUI was difficult as well because the music would either not play or freeze the program. Initially using playsound which gave the difficulty, and switched to pygame providing a simple solution to give the program the background noise we were looking for.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea and the work we've done for it. We made great progress considering python wasn't our strong suit, and even though we did not fully complete the project I think we did a great job.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Tkinter and python. We learned about Tkinter and how threading works with Tkinter: in a single fashion.
