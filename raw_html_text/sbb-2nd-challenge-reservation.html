                <p>
                    Users can reserve parking spot for an hour, starting from when they plan to arrive, the parking spot light turns red to show it is reserved. The users receives the number of the place they have to park in.

                    Sensors in the parking spot detect arrives. The user receives a notification saying their spot has been occupied.
