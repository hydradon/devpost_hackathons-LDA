                    Inspiration Whiteboards and the oculus. What squanch can I say? ## What it does Minimum Viable Product for a whiteboard in an oculus. Squanches not perfect, but it sends the image to a server, draws and saves on other computers, and squanches a pen to draw. It's a squanch whiteboard. ## How I built squanch Most of the code is in Unity. The backend is done over parse, and the drawing web service is in JavaScript ## Challenges I ran into Every single step got in our squanch. That didn't stop us. ## Accomplishments that I'm proud of ## What I learned ## What's next for Virtual Whiteboard It's in the minimum viable state. We can make it really nice though. It would just take a bit of time.
