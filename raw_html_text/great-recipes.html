                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to give users a nice way to find and learn about recipes. Great Recipes skill provides the same, easy to navigate UI as well as voice controls. It is also touch friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you launch the skill, you can either search for a recipe by saying the recipe name or you can tap any of the recipe categories that you might want to explore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both actions will take you to a recipe results search page of top rated recipes. You can tap, scroll or select the one you like to explore more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then you can either ask alexa to read the directions by saying "Alexa, directions" or explore the ingredients by saying "Alexa, Ingredients".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dedicated pages will take you through directions/ingredients step by step during your cooking process.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using node.js and using latest Alexa APL.

                    Lots.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Gathering recipes from internet in an automated manner. Had to tune the web crawler to find the recipes in the right way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Learning APL Sequences had some challenges. I couldn't understand how to plugin the data inside a Sequence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I couldn't get SpeakItem command to work for some reason, due to which I had to use my own highlighter for the search results. I spent a lot of time debugging the speakItem, but not enough debug information available from Alexa it seems.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add personalized experience. Where users can open and see their previously bookmarked recipes, last made recipes, recipes they might like and a lot more. I also want to make it easier for users to receive these recipe directions/ingredients. For example, adding to shopping list would be nice, and sending a text with ingredients list. Setting timer is also another feature I would like to add.
