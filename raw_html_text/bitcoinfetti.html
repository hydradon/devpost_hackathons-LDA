                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of the huge crypto-currency craze, many of my friends are constantly stuck to their mobile screens, watching their fortunes rise and fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to ease their pain and make it easier for them to notice it when the price of bitcoin rises and falls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever the price of bitcoin rises, the confetti to fly around more vigorously, and green LEDs light up to indicate it.
When the price of bitcoin falls, there will be less action in the bitcoinfetti and red LEDs will light up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an ESP32 to consume an API which gives us the price of bitcoin. Then, we linked it up to control the motor and LEDs.
