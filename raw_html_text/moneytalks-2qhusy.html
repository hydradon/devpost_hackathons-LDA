                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stemmed from the fact that we wanted to simplify the user interface between a user and their finances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our platform allows users to check their financial status with instantaneous ease through Amazon Echo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Mint API as the foundation to access user's financial data and the user interacted with their data through the Amazon Echo. This meant that we had to define our own skills for the Amazon Echo, and one of those skills includes using location tracking to verify user identity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was the creation of the skill for the Amazon Echo. It was initially difficult to debug the AWS Lambda interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to use the Amazon Echo for the first time with one of our skills. Also, we were able to use Pickle to bypass database creation to store our data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our primary achievements was developing an Amazon Alexa skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MoneyTalks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on rolling out more skills for Alexa and potentially incorporating data visualization through Amazon Echo Show.
