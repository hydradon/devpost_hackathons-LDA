                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every 1 in 59 children is diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) every year. With an estimated 1.4 million cases registered in the year 2018 itself. These children often struggle to recognise facial expressions and are consequently hindered in understanding social cues. Overcoming such problems requires an intensive behavioural therapy which is not only expensive, but also not universally accessible and consistently administered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have therefore decided to develop a system to automate facial expression recognition that runs on a wearable cap and delivers real-time visual (auditory) social cues to the autistic children, with the goal of creating a behavioural aid for these children that maximises behavioural feedback and provides an immersive memorisation, while minimising the distractions to the child.
