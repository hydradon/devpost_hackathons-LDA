                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As 2019 comes to a close, society is faced with the harsh reality of thousands of people dying every year due to opioid overdoses. The number of fatalities continues increasing year after year with little talk about the issue and how to help control it. We saw a need for an application for smart watches to help identify when a person&rsquo;s average heart rate dips to an alarming level. This identification would alert the emergency contacts of the paired phone by using an automated voice message to contact the authorities as the user is beginning to overdose on opioids.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Opioid Overdose Finder is a wear OS app for android smartwatches that monitors a user&rsquo;s heart rate to determine if a user is in danger of experiencing an opioid overdose. The user&rsquo;s heart rate is stored, and the average heart rate of the user is also calculated. If the current heart rate falls below a determined healthy heart rate based off the average, the application automatically communicates with the paired cell phone&rsquo;s emergency contacts. An automated text message is sent out to these contacts expressing that the user is beginning to overdose. An automated call to emergency services requesting assistance is also placed, ensuring that the user gets the medical attention they need as soon as possible. The GPS location of the user is also sent to both emergency contacts and emergency services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Opioid Overdose Finder was built using Android Studio, as this application is a standalone Wear OS smartwatch app. We tested the app with the LG-W150 Urbane Smart Watch using the Wear OS API to get the sensor data directly from the OS. The app learns the average heart rate of the user both on opioids and when sober and then uses that data to detect anomalies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team's lack of experience with Android Studio and with building apps in general led to a lot of roadblocks. It was difficult to get an app up and running on the smart watch at all, let alone designing the UI and logic of our app. Detecting the Smart Watch&rsquo;s sensor data for heart rate also caused a major roadblock on our highway to success. These obstacles compounded with the lack of time in a 24-hour hackathon called for a very difficult and stressful event at times.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to take an idea from concept to reality is one of the most rewarding things that you can do. We're proud of how far our team got with our project despite the challenges and setbacks we faced. We came into this hackathon without a large amount of experience involving Java coding in general, let alone Android Wear technology and emulation, we were able to successfully create a functioning application for the LG Smart Watch in question.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team gained a significant amount of knowledge regarding the access and use of the WearOS sensor present within wearable technology to measure heart rates. Also, having come in to this hackathon with very little knowledge of the application creating software, Android Studio,  we learned how to incorporate Java into app development and design implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Opioid Overdose Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Opioid Overdose Finder plans to expand and adapt to the coming future. As a team, we plan to keep our eyes on upcoming technology to improve our project. We'd like to incorporate more machine learning in the aggregation of and subsequent predictive modelling of our heart rate detection software. We also will need to update the code that will contact the proper authorities when text messaging dispatchers become the normality in society.
