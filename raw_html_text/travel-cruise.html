                <p>
                    It is a platform made with Bootstrap, Google Maps API which uses a back-end made with Python, Javascript and rome2rio API.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the UI communicate with the backend was the most challenging part and having the server running all the time was quite challenging.
                </p>
