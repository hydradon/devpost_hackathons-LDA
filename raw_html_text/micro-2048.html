                    We saw a live plot of the Microbit accelerometer data on an app and were intrigued by the way the sensor readings reacted to our movement. An idea for a game started to appear......

                    Micro-2048 is a gesture driven 2048 game. The player swipes a Microbit across the air to move the tiles on the screen. It uses radio connection, which means that the player can play it without sitting in front of a computer.

                    We used two Microbits, one is connected to the computer via serial. This then talks to a Node.js server, which relays the sensor information to a browser based javascript game. The other Microbit acts as a game controller, it publishes the gestures it detects through the radio. Together they make a user gesture driven game.

                    We initially had another idea that involved a lot of electronics. Unfortunately, we lacked the components and the experience needed to execute that idea, so we had to switch ideas with only 12 hours left to spare. However, we did manage to successfully pivot and reuse most of our code for a completely different application

                    A few of our teammates no little experience with python, but they managed to learn rapidly during the course of the Hackathon and gained a fundamental knowledge by the end of it.

                    We have learnt is that it is much more efficient to start with something with basic functionality and then iterate to make it better, rather than aiming too high from the beginning. Also, it's very important to be flexible and make directional changes when necessary. The most important of all is that we should enjoy the process, and not chase the destination.

                    This project act as a proof of concept that Microbits can bring a completely new experience to gaming. In the future, more games may be powered by the Microbit with more complex gesture drove interfaces.
