                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the popular web-based game "Tank Trouble."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine Mania is a local-multiplayer fighting game for Android that pits up to 8 players against each other on a single phone screen. The only limitation is the size of your screen! If you stop moving your character for a bit, you will charge up your weapon and fire. Anyone hit by stray bullets is out! Alternatively, if you lift your finger off the screen, you're out. Various weapons and power ups allow for more replayability and ensures a unique match every time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game from scratch in Unity, going through various different ideas of what we wanted. Eventually, we came up with Machine Mania and worked to create a map and players. We created different power ups for weapons and change weapon charge times for balance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to make it multiplayer on multiple devices but struggled with networking. We eventually decided that our time would be better spent and that it seemed more fun for the game to be on one device, making a unique experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine Mania has a completely original soundtrack, consisting of 2 original songs and a dozen original sound effects. This game was our first ever time making a true mobile app so publishing that was an achievement in and of itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that attempting to network physics can prove challenging, especially in a timed environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Machine Mania
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we could add more power ups/weapons, character customization, different game modes, and better movement.
