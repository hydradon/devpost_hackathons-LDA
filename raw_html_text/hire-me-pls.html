                    Its hard for people to begin their careers, especially when they don't have the resources or help to do so. HireMePls aims to solve this challenge.

                <p>
                    Messenger, being one of widely used platforms in the world, has billions of users from various demographics. HireMePls is an accessible messenger bot that aims to help young adults who don't have the career guidance resources to get a jump start to their careers. It asks targeted questions based on the users career interests and helps automatically generate a resume based on their responses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HireMePls has a backend running in the cloud, and responds to messages sent via Messenger.

                    Some challenges building HireMePls include getting the server running, breaking up parts of the project so multiple people can work on it together, and integrating the application with Messengers API.
