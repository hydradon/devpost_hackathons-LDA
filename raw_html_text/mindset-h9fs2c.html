                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After we learned of the theme of the hackathon being sustainability, we decided to focus on good health and well-being. But instead of just focusing on general health, we've decided to focus on mental and emotional health, which often goes ignored in society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to make an account, guides you in daily meditation, takes a quantitative note of how you're feeling emotionally and uses that to match you with someone with a similar emotional state. The purpose is to be able to match you with someone that can relate to your circumstances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This submission is a prototype app built in Adobe XD. We first brainstormed ideas for the app, created several "storyboards", and then translated our vision to the mock-up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge that we ran into is that our team is mostly made up of people with a pure data science background with little to no experience with software development. We had amazing ideas but struggled to bring many of them into fruition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we made a working prototype of the app despite having little development experience and we're also proud that we've learned how to use Adobe XD on the spot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned that prototyping and brainstorming is an extremely useful tool because we get to see ideas that wouldn't have seen the light of day in the first place to not only come to fruition but also get improved upon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mindset
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So we would like to work to bring the app to full functionality on both iOS and Android devices. In addition, we would love the opportunity to implement the matching algorithm, especially since most of the team are data scientists. We were thinking about using a k-nearest neighbor model to go about the matching. We wanted to take advantage of the fact that that specific machine learning model treats each observation in a dataset as a vector (each observation in this case can be a person's emotional state over the last 30 days) and would make matching reliant on the Euclidean distance.
