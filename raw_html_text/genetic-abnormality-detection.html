                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The book _ inheritance: how our genes change our lives, and our lives change our genes summary _ by Sharon Moalem inspired this idea. The idea of detecting facial features to determine whether or not an individual experiences a genetic abnormality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application takes a picture of a face, then 2D maps the face to measure the distance between facial features. For example, we would compare the distance between the eyes to determine the chances of an individual having a debilitating genetic disease. We also take race, age, and gender into account when deciding these conditions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it on Open CV and located prominent facial features in a person's eyes. Then with Tkinter we displayed the effects they may face with their measures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole project was pretty difficult to deal with as facial features can be very nuanced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of accomplishing the task of detecting genetic abnormalities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned more about the genetics of humans and attained in depth knowledge in Open CV
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Genetic Abnormality Detection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We expect to implement neural networks and machine learning to detect more genetic abnormalities.
