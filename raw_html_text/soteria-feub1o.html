                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a New Yorker we have suffered from multiple crowded train experiences. Most of the time this problem occurs because the crowd is not distributed evenly.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses machine learning to count the number of people it identified in real time, and gives you an feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and machine learning. We were able to get trained corpus data, which we used to

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't really know much about machine learning, and Computer vision, so we had to learn it from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were successfully able to identify objects in real-time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine learning requires a lot of resources.

                    What's next for Soteria
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can implement this on security cameras, once we detect that there are dangerous weapons, the Soteria can notify the police. Soteria can also be implemented in movie theaters and buses to give us real-time information whether there is an available seat.
