                <p>
                    Inspired by the famous longest Yea Boi, we decided to see if we could actually rank the best and longest Yea Bois.

                    Originally a joke idea, this project became a fully fledged arcade game style competition with speech recognition, responsive UI, and hardware components.

                    While the GameBoi is designed to be a light-hearted and fun project, there are potentially beneficial implications with this game. Because the game is measuring how long a user can say a certain word, we can use this scoring to measure lung capacity, and along with other data such as the user's location, we can see how different players perform in different areas. This could be an indicator of poor air quality in certain geographical locations, and the GameBoi can help us gather this data in a fun and creative way.
