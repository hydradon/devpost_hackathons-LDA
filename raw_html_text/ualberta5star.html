                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tired of going to "bad" washroom on campus
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lists all the washrooms on campus with ratings based on community ratings
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built it using android studio and youtube tutorial on creating clickable app cards
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android oreo does not like clear text requests, building a base template that is versatile for multiple types data, making a backed api that connects with the database and doing the calculations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    able to make a clickable card, and the data is populated from a api call to the database
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    making an "api" and how it can be used to make data processing easier on the user device, and more secure since the user does not have access to the data directly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for uAlberta5Star
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Store images on the device, so it does not have to make calls to the server for image. 
Allow users to submit locations, and leave ratings, one vote per washroom per device.
