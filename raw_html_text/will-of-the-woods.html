                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The environment and the money you can make from collecting it from collecting money.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Humanity has concentrated it's will into an embodied sphere due to the lack of trees in the world. This sphere is what will bring the world back normalcy and this somehow generates income for those within the forest. It's an endless runner.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity and C# to create this game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to implement the player to be able to knock down lumberjacks who were chopping down the trees but due to time restrictions and animation complexities, I took that out in order to make a simple endless runner where money is accumulated instead.
                </p>
