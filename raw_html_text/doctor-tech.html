                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our family members inspired us. Our grandparents had trouble several times in their lives trying to receive their prescription. So we decided this was the perfect business as an ode to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doctor Tech as a medical app allows you to order medication, receive a possible diagnosis and in times of urgent need it will send a signal to a local EMS. It allows you to store your medical records in a blockchain which is hard to hack and will allow the patients to control who has access to their records.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used slidebean.com and google slides to develop our business presentation. We used visual studio to make our website.

                    That you cannot take this lightly. Also, that you have to do your research and must work as a team.
