                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had been an early adopter of the Amazon Echo and we hadn't done anything with since we had got it. So when I saw this competition I decided that I would create something for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill is a trivia game that involves the user saying a noun in a particular genre that starts with the last letter of the previous answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I developed the Alexa skill as a Web API using Visual Studio 2017 and C#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were multiple challenges including
1) Properly handling the built-in Yes and No intents
2) Caching of session and its responses in memory to validate a city that was called earlier in the game
3) Developing and debugging code for request validation that was required for certification
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to create an Alexa Skill and host it as a custom Web API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for the Relay Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the moment, the Relay Game skill only supports the genre of American cities. I plan on adding more genres, a hint feature, and a fun fact feature.
