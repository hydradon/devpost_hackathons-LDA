                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MetroPolygon takes inspiration from retro 2D platformers, while incorporating elements from modern choice based games, including multiple endings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tells a story (mostly) without words. Reminds you that actions have consequences, and that the
                    <em>
                        right
                    </em>
                    action may not always be the
                    <em>
                        best
                    </em>
                    one. Most importantly, reminds us that we can actually achieve something half decent if we set our minds to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was put together in GameMaker Studio 2.0, with art made in paint.net and music in GarageBand .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of us had never used GameMaker before, and none of us had ever seen a game made through to completion. The biggest challenge was the final cutscene, which produced a lot of bugs and headaches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall we think we made a pretty good game considering the time frame, and our past experience (or total lack thereof).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    40 hours is a long time to stay awake. It's also enough time to make a game, surprisingly, but only with a bit of panic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MetroPolygon?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We might try to iron out some of the issues and add a few levels, maybe some better enemy AI, puzzle elements, and a more fleshed out story. Most likely though, it'll sit here as a reminder of our first attempt, whether that comes to be a fond memory or a cringey one.
