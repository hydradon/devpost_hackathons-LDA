                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration comes from the idea of the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break and look at something 20 feet away. We were also inspired by Chris's choice of great music.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is used for giving the user a break from the computer, phone, or work. An alarm is set and can only be turned off by some physical activity.

                    We used Android Studio to create the app.
