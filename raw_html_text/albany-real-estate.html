                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired by the idea of finding homes via voice. When Alexa Presentation Language was released, we knew it would be a great fit for real estate!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first steps of purchasing a house are determining your needs. Albany real estate walks the consumer through the common choices - location, price, bedrooms and more. The skill then conducts a search of live multiple listing service data to return results meeting the user&rsquo;s desired parameters. Then, Albany Reał Estate meets the potential home buyer&rsquo;s next immediate need - being able to see photos of the exterior and interior of the matching homes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a proprietary framework built by Voiceter Pro's engineers in Java. It relies on a backend in Ruby on Rails to handle all housing data APIs and user login data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a tough time coming up with the final designs for the screens. We haven't been much of a front end team because voice hasn't had an easy way to be multi-modal until now. We had to find someone quickly who could help us design for this completely new interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That it is much better to be deliberate in creating visual designs and that it is worth the money to get someone who is good at it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Albany Real Estate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will keep improving our user experience to bring the best housing results to Alexa users.
