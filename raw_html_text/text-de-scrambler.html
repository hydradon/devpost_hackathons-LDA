                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a simple and effective way to do our English homework faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    T3xt is a word descrambler. That means that you can enter a string of characters and it will tell you if they make a word.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To create T3xt, we used Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge my partner and I came across while creating T3xt was to eliminate permutations that were not in the English dictionary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After finishing the project with getting the result that we expected my partner and I were overwhelmed by a feeling of joy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python is more than capable of running such a complex program and is extremely easy to learn and use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Text de-scrambler
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that we can sell T3xt to encryption companies after we upgrade it to break encryption codes.
