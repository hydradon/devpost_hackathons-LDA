                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration: it is not easy to find basic essential information among the mountains of online content at our college. So, we decided to start by assisting with the student-life experience in several meaningful ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finds student resources on campus for useful things like cheap food and tutoring.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with a decision tree, then moved into the Alexa Developer Console, and then the lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was how fast we went from zero to here.
A last minute challenge was wading into the json, but it was helpful to track down those slot id errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did a really good job and finished the project.  We were a perfect group, and it turned out that each of us have unique strengths that contributed to our overall success.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa made learning AI fun and useful.
