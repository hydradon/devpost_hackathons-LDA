                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day, I was going my local music store and as I entered I noticed there was a bulletin board full of flyers. These flyers consisted of people looking for musicians to play with. I was shocked to find out that these many people are still using print to find their ideal musician.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects you to other musicians who have similar visions in music, so you can engage with them to play music

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was my first time coding, so there was a huge learning curve. Not only learning the language but planning and executing the product.
