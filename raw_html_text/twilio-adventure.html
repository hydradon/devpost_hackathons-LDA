                    We were thinking about what to do and came up with this idea. It is a text based RPG using twilio's SMS communication. We built it using python. There were several problems through out however the solution is in a semi-working state. We've learned a lot about python and what not to do. If we were to continue with this, we'd implement more scenarios.
