                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a student of UCSC, I have seen the struggles and hardships that many of my peers face when trying to traverse this campus in order to get to class on time. I can only imagine how much more difficult this would be for someone with a physical disability. Thankfully, UCSC provides help through the Disability-Resource-Center to those in need of accommodations. Among those services provided is transportation around campus. However, it is our belief that the process to apply/request rides could be streamlined and improved in order to provide a better experience for those students that need it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Slug Ride provides an interactive interface for the user to easily call and request a drive. Accommodation reservations are automated and streamlined in order to make a simple connection between the user and the DRC. Users' class schedule, class locations, and van requests data are then analyzed in order to provide an optimal drive schedule for the van driver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end of the app was built on android-studio. The User's information is then stored on Google's Firebase along with the UCSC class-schedule. Ideally, in the future, the information will be analyzed using Google's Machine Learning API to optimize routes and scheduling.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The time constraint of this competition and outside academic work.
