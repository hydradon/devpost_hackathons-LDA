                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone gets bored sometimes. We wanted to make sure that anytime you're bored you at least know what's going on in the area around you. RadiUS lets you view local happenings as well as create you own.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RadiUS is an android app that uses ArcGIS to display local events. Details about these local events can then be viewed, you can rsvp, and create an event of your own, all associated with a location. When you create an event anyone within a certain radius of you can see the event and either show up or rsvp.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RadiUS was built client-side in android studio with a node.js backend in IBM bluemix. This is connected to a sql database as well as the arcGIS server.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    GUI is difficult
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll probably keep working on it as a side project, maybe it'll show up on the app-store.
