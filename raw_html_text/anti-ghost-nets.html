                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired to monitor and save fish populations and particularly save the endangered species
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It detects fish sounds and runs an algorithm on it to determine the species of fish and also to estimate the population of fish
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a microphone with corresponding long-range radio transmitter mounted at vantage points at sea to detect and send the results to ground station for further analysis
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of now, it is still in the prototype stages and would be restricted to fishes that only produce sound
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to use digital signal processing techniques to help solve real-world problems around us
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned that innovation is all about leveraging the little technologies we have around us
