                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from the language barriers that we have all faced in our lives. Whether it is traveling to a different country, immigrating, or going on exchange, not knowing another language can be a major obstacle to learning and experiencing different cultures. International Exchange breaks down these language barriers by translating voice messages and text messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    International Exchange connects two users of different language backgrounds and allows both users to communicate with each other in their respective languages. For instance, if a user who understands English wishes to communicate with another user who speaks French, the English user can speak or text in English, and International Exchange will translate the speech/text into French for the French user, and vice versa. This way, people of different languages and cultural backgrounds can communicate with ease, promoting a more culturally understanding, inclusive and diverse society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use Python, how to implement APIs, and web development. For all of us, it was our first hackathon and we learned to work and learn with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for International Exchange
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An extra feature we will implement is video calling with translation subtitles. Additionally, we would like to design a mobile app for users. We would also like to include an algorithm that pairs users based on interests.
