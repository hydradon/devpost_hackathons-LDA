                    Our app is designed as a filter that can block out certain words or phrases that are offensive. It also allows the user add a word or phrase and it can start filtering that out too.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Xcode, an ios development software.

                    We still haven't been able to get the adding feature down but it's coming.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's more complicated than you think it is to make a simple database inside of an iphone app.

                    We plan to improve the interface so that it's more user friendly. We are going to make it so that it can be integrated in social media apps. We will fix the adding functionality.
