                    Oink is a mobile app.
It connects to your bank to collect real-time transaction data. It calculates your income on a monthly basis and carves out your necessary expenses (ie. rent, groceries, transportation, etc.) and your monthly savings. What is left is your monthly spending budget. This budget is spread over each day of the month to give you a daily budget. 
Each morning, users will wake up to a notification of their budget for the day as well as tips for how to remain within it.
Throughout the day, purchases connected to your bank will be automatically uploaded to the app. With this data, your daily budget will adjust. When you are close to reaching your daily budget, the app will send you warning notifications.
Based on whether your were under or over budget for the day, tomorrow's daily budget will be re-calculated.
At the end of the month, Oink will produce a monthly report where you can view how much you spent every day of the month and whether that amount was under or over your budget in a calendar formal. Days in which you were under budget will be green, and days in which you were over budget will be red - this will provide for a simple visualization of how compliant you are with your daily budgets.
If at the end of the month, you spent less than your total monthly spending budget, that amount will be moved to a savings or investment account.
Current competitors include (a) banks which provide simply budgeting tools that users often forget about and (b) mobile apps that provide platforms to understand one's overall net worth. What they fail to do is make budgeting a

                        daily practice
                    </em>
                    in order to set habits and change youth culture around money management. 
Oink focuses on the day-to-day of money management. By providing daily real-time budgets, we hope for users to set a habit of daily conscious budgeting and an overall culture of financial responsibility beginning at a young age. In other words, we believe that daily budgeting is a gateway practice to broader financial responsibility!
