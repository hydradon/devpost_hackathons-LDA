                <p>
                    Mental health is one of the largest public health issues that is often overlooked. Nearly 1 in 5 of adults in the United States suffers from a mental illness, but 60% of  those adults are left untreated. Mental health remains a highly stigmatized health issue, and

                    Allyx helps detect unusually high levels of stress through a Meta Health chip. The Meta Health chip contains the following sensors:

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the hardware, we utilized the Pebble to monitor heart rate and Amazon Echo to speak to the patient. As for the software, we used JQuery, HTML5, and CSS3 to develop the website and then API.ai to help program the AI for Echo, and finally ResponsiveVoice&rsquo;s API for text-to-speech capabilities.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Lack of hardware, namely the new Pebble 2, lack of knowledge regarding JQuery.

                <p>
                    In determining what we should call our innovation, we decided to combine the name from A gender neutral name for Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa (
