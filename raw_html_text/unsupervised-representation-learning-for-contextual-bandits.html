                <p>
                    Recent advances in deep unsupervised learning allow for learning concise yet rich representations of images, audio, natural language, and more. Integrating these representations into sequential decision-making paradigms such as reinforcement learning is an essential step to creating general-purpose agents that can robustly incorporate diverse unstructured sources of data. We consider the contextual bandit setting as a tractable and real-world applicable version of reinforcement learning.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We base our work off of recent work from Google Brain:

                        Deep Bayesian Bandits Showdown
                    </a>
                    . This paper (and accompanying TensorFlow code) implements a simple MLP-based method for learning contexts from hand-crafted features via contextual bandit feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our contribution: we extended this work to include a novel unsupervised representation learning step. Specifically, we pre-train an unsupervised model, and use the learned embedding as an input to the context encoding MLP. We re-implemented contextual bandit algorithms with deep Thompson sampling in PyTorch, and test our algorithm on several tasks, including the Mushroom dataset, MNIST, and polarized Yelp reviews.

                <p>
                    We confirmed that our code works properly by testing on the Edible Mushroom dataset. For the image MNIST dataset and text Yelp dataset, we trained a variational autoencoder and obtained averaged BERT embeddings respectively. We load and process our data using the

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ported a contextual bandit model from Tensorflow to Pytorch. Then, we took various sources of real data (MNIST, Yelp 1-2 reviews) and built unsupervised models to contextualize such data into a low-dimension context vector. Finally, we trained the contextual bandit model on the generated contexts and compared regret to its baselines.
