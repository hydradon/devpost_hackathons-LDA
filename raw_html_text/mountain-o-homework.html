                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I find it useful for myself to give myself a set amount of time to work, but I also get distracted by my phone, this ideally solves both these issues
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I creates a timer and a climber climbs the mountain while you do your work, incentivising you to not use phone, so the climber can reach the top of the mountain
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using android studio and using whatever tutorials/information was available in the standard android references
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i have used android studio once before, many months ago, so most of my time was spent learning how to make an android app and what features were available to me. One major hurdle was figure out how to animate the mountain climber
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    many, many things about android, and how terrible it is to make sprites and to use sprite animation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mountain O' Homework
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to add more features, such as resetting the mountain climber if the app is exited and a score keeping systems.
