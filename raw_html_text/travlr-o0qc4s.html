                    New to our team, we decided to explore the idea of microservices. Doing so allowed us to segment travlr into distinct, externally useful services.

                <p>
                    The first of which is our website back-end, this contains the business logic behind travlr. We also have microservices for intelligently finding nearby events and attractions, determining currency conversions based on gps location and for businesses to serve promotions to travlrs.

                    We expect to continue developing travlr after HTN. Having worked towards a minimum viable product for the last 36 hours, we have come to terms with the full breadth and scale possible with travlr. Many features didn't make it into the MVP so allow me to elaborate --

                    Business model
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The core business model of travlr is similar to, and much inspired by, Pokemon GO. Imagine the 'lure' system, businesses can offer up incentives such as group discounts -- maybe a free drink if a group of 10 or more travlrs visit, for example. This can be stretched in similar ways, consider the UBER surge pricing model -- but in reverse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of our three team members traveled from the UK, during our trip; and many before this, we have struggled to decide exactly what we want to do with our time when travelling. This is especially true for day trips to cities for example. This sparked our initial idea to apply machine learning to make an interest -&gt; event matching system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Travlr, in its current dev state, suggests events based on a users interests, their location, their willingness to travel etc. It tracks the travlr to suggest events nearby, and features a cross platform UI meaning it can be used on any device. We have architected travlr to be scaleable, for the addition of the previously mentioned features at a later date. This is why we took the microservice approach.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it doesn't
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The scope for travlr was large -- even for a month long project, let alone a 36hr hackathon. We went into the project well aware of this, but continued as the breadth of knowledge we gained in infrastructure, new languages and frameworks was incredibly valuable. Our release version did not quite hit our MVP plan but features fully capable microservices using Google cloud services.
