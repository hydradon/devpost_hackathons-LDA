                    Our program calculates the users recommended daily calorie intake based on their age, height, weight, sex, and physical activity. The user then selects the foods they eat in a day and the program calculates the amount of calories, fat, sodium, carbohydrates, and protein they have consumed and tells them if they have exceeded any of their recommended daily limits.
