                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apps like Uber  have made it easy to get around without owning a car. However,  a lot of people do own cars, and they are necessary for making trips that Uber drivers don't want to make. So we made Four. Four connects people making these trips with people who would want to carpool with them, reducing the cost for the driver, and saving the rider a lot of money.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drivers can add trips that they will be making in the next 24 hours, and riders can view these trips, filter out the ones that don't go to their destination, and join one that does.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Parse to support our backend, while the frontend uses standard iOS technologies. We used the uber API and mapKit to figure out ride times, costs.
