                    The website we created is meant to invoke a change in the community and is meant to be an asset for high schoolers looking for volunteering opportunities. Throughout the building process, some of the challenges we faced included building the compatibility quiz on our website, and getting it to output the desired message that we wanted. It also took a great deal of patience and time to get the format of the website to be as we wanted, and it was a challenge to get everything ready in time for the submission. However, it was an amazing experience that we would never trade for any other. It taught all of us how to have persistence and resilience, and we were all very happy to see a website of our creation finished and ready for others to see. All in all, it was a great experience!
