                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After learning about how to use Interfaces in our AP Computer Science class, we thought that it would be a really good to test it with Two Player Games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can pick between 5 (or 6 if you include Checkers, but we ran out of time to complete it) different unique two player games to play with his/her friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built in the java using JOptionPane to add a GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was really difficult to format the GUI board for battleship and checkers, and programming wise we ran into a lot of logical errors such as not generating our battleships in the correct locations, or not being able to get the elapsed time for the typing competition correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to finish programming 5 different games throughout the day
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use JOptionPane to make textbased programing games more interesting, and understanding more about the power of Interfaces.

                <p>
                    Add local networking so friends can play real time on different computers
