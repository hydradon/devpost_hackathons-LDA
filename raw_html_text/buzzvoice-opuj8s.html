                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the bus ride to the hackathon, we overheard a conversation about Morse code. At the time we were thinking about what to build, so we thought of various applications that could use Morse code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You speak a phrase into it, you press a button, and it vibrates what you said in Morse code. We imagine this as being helpful for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, who could use it to communicate with people who do not know ASL or another sign language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of it is built with Javascript using the pebble.js library, but we also had to use C for certain things, most importantly in order to set the vibration sequences required to render each letter in Morse code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, for a small part of the app we had to use C to program it. Neither of us had much experience in it, but after many hours and lots of help from mentors we were able to do what we aimed to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going back to our whole experience with C, we're proud that we managed to (with help) program an important piece of our app in a language that we were unfamiliar with using documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BuzzVoice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the near future, we hope to expand BuzzVoice to also have a companion app on iOS and Android, so that it is more customizable for the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: If you want to try this using GitHub, then use the branch "working-version" on Github. The other ones are no good. (It'll probably just be easier for you to download it from the Pebble appstore though)
