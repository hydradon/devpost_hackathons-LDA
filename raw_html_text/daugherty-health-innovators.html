                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In many cases, the general population is not actively engaged in their personal health care.  For many people, medical jargon can be overwhelming, which is dangerous when it comes to understanding wellness.  In order to increase personal engagement in healthcare, it is important to create an environment where people want to learn and share their knowledge with their friends and family.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here is a link to our application:
                    <a href="https://github.com/tamraberger/healthack2018" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/tamraberger/healthack2018
                    </a>
                    Our application awards achievements and points based on healthy habits, such as learning about health topics and linking personal fitness trackers to the application.  By engaging individuals, they become invested in the application and will be more likely to use features such as sharing medication information with family to confirm adherence.
Upon logging in, the user is brought to the user home page which includes a leader score board and a news feed including information about the recent activity of their friends and family.  On the leader board, the user can see which three of their friends have the highest scores and how they compare with the leaders.  This encourages friendly competition; therefore, the user will be more likely to learn about a health topic to increase their score. 
There is a navigation bar on the left side of the screen which is present on all of the main pages making navigation through the site seamless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can click the family or friends link in the navigation bar and view a listing of all of their friends and family currently using the program.  We included two categories with the intent that users can customize which group will see each particular achievement (i.e. completed learning).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another link on the navigation bar called &ldquo;Go to my learning&rdquo; will take users to a page displaying a variety of topics they can learn about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can select a learning category and will be routed to a page with resources to learn about that category and can take quizzes.  Each item in the Learning Resource section is a link to an external source where the individual can learn about the topic.  There is a button which will route the user to a quiz regarding that topic and their scores for the quizzes are displayed on the far right. When they are confident with the information, they can click the &ldquo;Take the Quiz&rdquo; button and answer the quiz.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A submit button at the bottom of the quiz will initiate a pop-up which displays the user&rsquo;s test score and how many points they received for the quiz.  The points received varies depending on how well they completed the quiz.  If the user chooses to share the results, their friends and/or family (depending on how the user sets up their preferences) will see the user&rsquo;s activity in their own news feed.  If the user chooses &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; the activity will not be shared but they will still receive the points.  The user is prompted whether they would like to share each and every achievement they receive in order to reduce the accidental sharing of information that the user would prefer to keep private.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After completing the test, assuming the user chose to share the results, the new achievement will show up in the news feed.  The user can return to the news feed by clicking the &ldquo;Go to my news feed&rdquo; button in the navigation bar.
In addition to the new achievement, the user can now see a notification for a potential flu outbreak in their area.  Our application could have the capability to link to epidemic predictors and notify users of potential epidemics in their area.  By clicking the link, they will be directed to the illness learning category page where they can learn more about the illness in general and the epidemic if a link is provided.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with a default Angular application and some basic wireframes illustrating the workflow of our application.  We added components based on the wireframes and divided the work primarily by components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the tight scope of the assignment, the application was rapidly changing and required constant communication to ensure code being worked on concurrently would merge without conflict.  There were multiple instances in which the team had conflicting code but we worked together to resolve these quickly to continue with forward progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team has little combined UX experience; however, because the primary goal of the application is to engage individuals in their own healthcare, user experience is extremely important.  We are proud of the user interface we were able to put together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned to concurrently work on components that interact directly with each other.  We learned some great communication and source control techniques in order to avoid unnecessary code fixes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Daugherty Health Innovators
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Additionally, our application could link to personal fitness trackers to maintain records of steps, heart rate, sleep, and other fitness goals.  The user could receive achievements for reaching their fitness goals.  By using the activity sharing option, users could also be notified in the event that a family member did not record any information when it is expected.  In this case, it is possible that the family member has fallen and requires assistance which will allow a quick, proactive response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, with the simple addition of a medication management page, users could input the medications they are taking and the time at which they should take them.  Upon taking the medication, the user can mark the medication as taken and they will receive points for successful adherence to their medication schedule over a chosen period of time.  If the user does not mark the medication has taken, they will receive a notification after a short period of time.  If a longer period of time passes and the user still does not mark the medication as taken, family members using the application may be notified to assist with medication adherence.
