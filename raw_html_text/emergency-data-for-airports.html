                    This design was inspired by the concept of saving as many lives as possible during any emergency situation. We developed a concept that saved lives and allow the airport to gain complete access of the the Black Box and video recording of the cockpit no matter the state of the plane. This allows the airport to send help faster and created a flow of data giving them the capability to save lives and prevent accidents from happening like this again. In a plane a black box is stored in the nose and the rear but they often are destroyed leaving the airport with no data and families with no answers. This product would create a live stream of the incident heading straight to the airport and creating a permanent record that cannot be destroyed even if the plane does get destroyed.
