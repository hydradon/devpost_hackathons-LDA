                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We were inspired by the data acquisition of on-board diagnostic devices presented by GM and how we could integrate this technology with the mobile tools which are commonplace in today's society, mainly Google's map API.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program is a proof of concept build which actively collects automotive logistics data (gas tank level, tire life, battery life, etc.)  and automatically prompts users when parameters fall below set thresholds. For gas, upon reaching a lower threshold, the nearest and cheapest gas station is automatically recommended to the user. Simulated data is used to demonstrate the versatility of the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We constructed the main processing code and google API interactions in java with the intent of easily porting to an android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of our team had no prior experience in java, and learned how to write the code as we needed. The nuances of the language caused many roadblocks. This software also has little competition, with only 3 major apps in the mobile market at present and low popularity of OBDs in the consumer market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to learn java programming on the fly and deciphering operating with Google's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java, Google API, small scale OBD simulation.

                    What's next for Automatic Automotive Logistics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Porting to the Android platform, adding more levels of analysis, and creating driving optimization algorithms.
