                    This is a small mobile game that I made, which combines the power of mirror images, shadows, physics objects, and basic movement programming to create a fun infinite "avoider" type game with high replayability. It stores the user's current score, and at the end of each play shows them their best score and the score they got for that run. I made this game using buildbox, a software that allows you to code games for mobile and PC much easier and more efficiently than normal.  Personally, I am quite proud of the ideas that went into some of the areas in the game. I plan to hopefully upload this game to the iOS and Android app store when I can. I am extremely sorry but I have to show you the game form my computer, I cannot record a video of it or convert it into a usable .exe file.
