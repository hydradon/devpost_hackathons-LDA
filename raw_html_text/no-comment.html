                    Our inspiration was from wanting to combine new technology with airport customer experience. We wanted to make something that would improve customer experience and speed up check in time and quality of services.

                    to make this project, we used reactjs as the front end. Reactjs was the user interface. This user interface could be used on the check in on the kiosks at the airport. We used node.js for the back end server side. Node.js was used to access cloudifie's api. Cloudifie's api would manipulate the 64 bit image and post it to a website where we can gain access to a unique url. This process was basically making our own database of pictures. Next, node.js passed the unique URL back to reactjs, which then passed the unique URL it to Microsoft api . Microsoft api would then compare the likeness of the individual picture to other pictures in the Cloudifie's database. Microsoft api would never access this database directly. Microsoft api would get sent the URLs from all of the other pictures that could be possible matches.

                    microsft api gave us an error notification when it was already completing the action we wanted it to. the engineers at microft api could not even help us after hours on the phone trying to troubleshoot. We also ran into alot of git issues like merge conflicts and errors.
