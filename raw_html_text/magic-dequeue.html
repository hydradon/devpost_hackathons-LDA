                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were waiting in the long line for PF Chang's and realizes how nice it would be to reserve food at the same time as you reserve a table
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the user to reserve a seat  at the same time as their food, allowing the food to come out as soon as the user sits down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C# .NET core 2.0 for the backend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the front end. These two components interact with each other via HTTP requests
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CSV files were really difficult to work with with C#, so we had to create our own file parsing system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For four of us, this was our first successful dub hacks!
Collaborated with both front end and back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate under pressure in a time crunch. Syncing up both back end and front end development at the same time.
