                    What I learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that social isolation, inability of using technology and loneliness has negative impact on older person in home care. Therefore, connecting older people of mutual interest with simple technology platform improves their quality of life, independence in terms of activities of daily living, dignity, social connectedness and reduce depression. More generally, it enables them to be engaged in the community, contribute their experience, keep them out of hospital and residential aged care and reduce cost and health care burden.
                </p>

                    What's next for C U SOON?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C U Soon team will develop or adopt applications and website that connect elderly citizens of mutual interest via video and audio conferencing technology which enables them to be socially connected, use technology within their area of residence maintaining their dignity. It creates communication and knowledge. It is also relevant for aged care facility.
