                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are lazy people. A newbies in the art of building code, but lazier over everything else. And that situation makes a problem: when we have doubts, we don't want to ask to people who maybe don't know about what we're asking, so we think it's better to send the question to somebody who knows about the topic because he might be able to answer us faster and properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It sends the question you have about a topic to somebody in the data base who knows about the topic
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programing with Django backend and sqlite for the data bases, python libraries to make all the additional processors we can not make with the Django framework and the slack api to integrate our backend with the slack bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time doing something like that. We had some problems because of the spend time learning Django, then a member of the group deleted d&iexcl;the bot and we had to spend a lot of time reprograming and creating again another bot, and amount of stories like that...
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our project, it can always be better but it's a great job counting on the time we had. We learn a lot and had a great time #wedidntsleep #wedidnteat #wearetired

                    What's next for SlackSaca
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve the user experiences by adding buttons, more options to customize the questions that you'll receive, maybe add some language recognition... Who knows.
