                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team's random walk though the space of ideas, eventually diffusing until nothing of them remained.

                    Feedback is a simple process that can create complicated results. Applying it to a stochastic process seemed a natural exploration, and this hackathon was the perfect excuse to spend a weekend doing it.

                    How it was done
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much python graphing. I learned a lot about matplotlib formatting.

                <p>
                    The methods for feeding back generated surprisingly predictable results. In future, it would be nice to explore feedback in more interesting systems, as I have explored the space of random walks quite thoroughly.
