                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Steam (popular platform for PC gaming) currently does not support sorting games by even basic parameters such as player reviews or average hours played. We always had trouble discovering new games on Steam based on popularity and genre, and thus, we made SteamNOW to change this!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SteamNOW uses various API's tracking Steam data. With MySQL based sorting of game information, SteamNOW quickly displays popular games by various parameters such as average hours played and user reviews.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used various Steam tracking API's to pull in data into MySQL. We then used MySQL to query data, and created an API using Node.js to access the generated data. We then used React Native to display the data in an app.
                </p>
