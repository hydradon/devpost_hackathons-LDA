                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        We know airports are scary
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why we decided to make a simple web application for airlines to distribute to their first time flyers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Angular, we made a simple web app that gives new flyers an overview of what to expect at the airport.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used VSCode and node.js to develop and host our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one person on our team has done web development before, so we spent a few hours learning Angular and Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're glad to have had this amazing and immersive learning experience with some new frameworks that we have never seen before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Angular, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NewFly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UI improvements, and connecting with airlines' APIs to replace our flight info page with actual information.
