                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a tool that would help parents to educate their children, enhance empathy and reinforce positive values, while having a toy that would not bore kids.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create the first interactive toy for kids able to display emotions through colors, able to act autonomously or be controlled by parents via a mobile app, in order to help kids in their emotional and social development. We wanted everything to be built using the new wave of the internet of things, and create a toy that kids will see as something more than than a toy, a friend that they will spend the nights with!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had some goals in mind for the development of
                    <strong>
                        Purrpurino
                    </strong>
                    , which could benefit society in several ways:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        &middot;
                    </strong>
                    It would help parents reinforce good behaviours in their children. Parents can set Purrpurino's emotions, and Purrpurino will act depending of that state. For example if the toy is sick it will expect a kid to take care of him, and if it is playful it will expect the kid to play with him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>

                    </strong>
                    comes from a combination of different words - Purpurina (Spanish word for glitter), "Purr" (like the purring of cats) and the suffix
                    <em>
                        -ino

                    ) is a new plush toy that uses different sensors to interact with a kid, allowing them to learn from emotions and reinforce positive values. The way Purrpurino teaches about emotions is using different lights -  which correspond to different moods that are triggered depending of the actions of the kid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Purrpurino has 7 different states to display emotions:

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an Arduino 101 (Genuino 101 here in Europe) as the core brain of Purrpurino, and different sensors of the Grove Starter Kit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the Arduino 101 was crucial because it made it easy for us to create an app to communicate an Android app with the board, using the board integrated Bluetooth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Grove Starter Kit Plus sensor set was a perfect fit as it had the main components that we needed to make Purrpurino come alive:

                    state where he gets to know his new owner. His cheeks are blushed in this state and he needs to be petted to get used to the new owner. After some caresses, the light of Purrpurino will turn green while purring delightfully as a cat, as that indicates the
                    <strong>
                        happy

                    state. Now the functions of Purrpurino can be showed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new owner can play with Purrpurino, shaking Purrpurino gently to have a good time, but if he gets shaken too much, he will become
                    <strong>
                        dizzy
                    </strong>
                    . Some petting will fix his dizziness and he will be happy again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A parent or guardian can modify the mood status of Purrpurino through an app designed to do so. This way a parent can

                </p>
                <p>
                    Purrpurino can go to

                        sleep
                    </strong>

                    Purrpurino has a button in his right paw to enable "lantern mode" so no matter if he is sleeping you can use it to brighten the room.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never created before a connected app using bluetooth with a hardware device and it took some days before we could send data between devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plug-and-play hardware are not always easy to set up! We had some trouble with some parts of the hardware, that took us more time that expected to make it work properly. For example, the stepper motor was not working as what it was expected from the documented examples and it was a lot of trial and error to make the piezo vibration sensor to get the petting feeling that we wanted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble when we had to fill everything inside the plush toy, as the components are rigid and we were fitting in a soft space, that continuously was being pressed, which led frequently to malfunctions and cable disconnection when we were testing the "live" prototype.
