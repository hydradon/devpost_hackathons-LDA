                </h2>
                <p>
                    Awkward moments in clubs when asking for social media.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Sends contact information (e.g. phone number, Facebook) to people over NFC by tapping each other's phones.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android (Java, XML).
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facebook removed the ability to programatically send friend requests, preventing us from implementing such a feature. Also, none of us had much experience with Android, which is a very beginner-unfriendly platform.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completed a MVP for the project. 
Looks relatively decent. 
Working together as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How filepaths are represented in Android (content and file URIs).
How the XML relates to the Java in Android.
Android activities keep recreating themselves even when you expect it.
How intents work.

                    Can add toggles to prevent some details from being transferred.
Find a way to automatically send friend requests.
Add support for Bluetooth and group visibility (like in Snapchat).
Store past interactions in a list.
