                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to test our own knowledge on Texas A&amp;M University's traditions, and thought that we could challenge our peers as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user travels around the map and reaches 6 landmarks here on campus! They will be asked to answer one question, and the score will be calculated at the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using PyCharm as our IDE, we used pyGame and python to write the code. Graphics were made in photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with learning how to use pyGame, but we managed to figure out the syntax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the graphics and the ability to make a working quiz game that kept track of score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brainstorming is actually one of the hardest parts of the process; once we had the ball rolling, execution was rather straightforward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tour of TAMU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could increase the number of questions per location as well as enhance the graphics to make a more fully-fleshed game.
