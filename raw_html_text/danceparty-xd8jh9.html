                    The user is given options in the game that will be combined at the end to create a fun, simulated dance party. Lines of pseudo code are displayed on the screen to show the programming concepts that are being taught. We chose this type of game because we were inspired to try to teach children the very basics of programming. We looked back to when we each first learned how to program, even though some of us are newer at programming and others are more experienced, we could agree on the first things that we learned. There are concepts that are used in programming no matter what language is being used and understanding these are important to programming, so using if statements, booleans, and integers the user creates a party.
