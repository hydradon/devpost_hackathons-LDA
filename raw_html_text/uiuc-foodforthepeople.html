                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're a bunch of starving, struggling college students just trying to get food so we can graduate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app scrapes various University calendars and finds events that provide free food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to automate scraping data, Firebase as our database, and Javascript/HTML as our front-end for our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took us a while to figure out how to automate scraping the data. It was also difficult trying to figure out how to push the data onto the website, as well as authentication issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Firebase as a database and the authentication process. Events that provide free food that even we didn't know existed!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UIUC FoodForThePeople
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to make it easier to add events to the database, and we plan on having an option to export the entire calendar as an iCal file or to Google Calendar directly
