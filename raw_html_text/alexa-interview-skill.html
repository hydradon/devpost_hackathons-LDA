                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from this groups' anxiety about upcoming interviews and the desire to get more practice answering interview questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Alexa Skills Kit, we are developing an interactive "interviewer" so the user can hold a mock interview in the comfort of their own home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Alexa Skills Kit, we created the interaction model based off of how we think an interview would go. With the Lambda function, we created a backend that would store the user's responses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the majority of our team has had no experience programming before, a lot of time was spent learning basic programming concepts (dictionaries, lists, if/else statements) so all members could contribute to the writing of the lambda function.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that the first project we have created is something that can be useful to people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working as a team, we can accomplish things that we couldn't accomplish alone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa-Interview-Skill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future as we expand our programming knowledge we hope to build more functionality into our skill. In particular, we would like to make our skill more dialogue based instead of a one-sided conversation.
