                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating flashcards can be exhausting. You need paper and a writing tool to create them, you have to remember to bring them with you, and you have to carry them about. We wanted to make it easy to quickly and effectively study for tests while providing various ways of doing so.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StudyTime allows you to create decks of flashcards to study by yourself, or with a friend. In solo mode, you are able to go through the cards quickly and randomly to reinforce your memory. Alternatively, you can choose to input the answers to receive confirmation of the correct answer. At the end, you will receive a score.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using multi-peer connectivity, you can choose a deck to study with your friend. They will see the answer, while you view the corresponding hint. The idea is that you guess the answer, and your friend tells you if you were right or wrong. This helps both of you revise, especially if you take turns in each role.

                    What's next for StudyTime
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to keep the decks of flashcards in the cloud so that they can be shared between devices. Similarly, a shared public database would allow decks to be shared between users on a sort of 'marketplace'.
