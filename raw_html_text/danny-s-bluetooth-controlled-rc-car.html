                    All of the lovely members of IEEE inspired me. Also Muffins (my cat).

                    I can make it go forward, backward, left and right via bluetooth.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Arduino, bluetooth module, jumper wires, motor driver, DC motors, wheels, and cardboard box.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very challenging in general since its the first project I've ever created. I pretty much learned how to use Arduino in the past 12 hours. I tried adding a Pixy camera that would be able to detect oranges, but that proved to be too difficult.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to create my first project in general. It's like seeing your first-born child. I'm proud that I now have an understanding of Arduino and can now work on future projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino, C, how to use motor drivers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Danny's bluetooth-controlled RC car.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully I can get the Pixy camera to work in the future as well as add a better chassis.
