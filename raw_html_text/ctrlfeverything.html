                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here&rsquo;s how it works: a user can set up cameras in places like different rooms at home, where a Qualcomm Dragonboard takes pictures and communicates with these cameras every minute. The pictures are sent to an I/O server, then to a computing server, which integrates Google&rsquo;s Cloud Vision API. All of our hosting, databases, and vision code are backed with Google Cloud Platform. One noteworthy thing is that the I/O server does not send any pictures already processed for processing again. The processed pictures, tagged with things found in them, are sent to our database through the I/O server. Now what happens on the user&rsquo;s side is, as he searches for something by either typing it or using our dope voice recognition, the I/O server grabs the corresponding pictures and present them to the user, together with the time they were taken, which devices took them, and controller IP.

                <p>
                    First, we plan to provide customization of device names, so you can name your cameras &ldquo;kitchen&rdquo;, &ldquo;bedroom2&rdquo;, etc. We also will provide geolocation based on the controller&rsquo;s IP, so that those who have cameras in multiple locations don&rsquo;t get confused. Another important feature we want to implement is user authentication: so that users can only access pictures their cameras take, or someone else&rsquo;s that are shared to them. This leads to considerations of scalability, which is easy to implement on our side; all we need to do is add more servers, and perhaps databases, where we will distribute users&rsquo; pictures in different databases without confounding them.
