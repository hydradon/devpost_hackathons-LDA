                    Alexa -- P3RS1ST Number Game (Persist) skill description
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Match wits with Alexa in this nifty game of numbers. The object of P3RS1ST ("persist") is to reduce the starting number down to the target single-digit number by taking turns naming interim numbers, formed using all the digits of the current number in only 1 of 3 allowable ways: the sum of the digits (add them all together), the product of the digits (multiply them all together), or the same digits with a single digit appended (append a digit 0-9). Whoever reaches the target number first wins. As an added challenge, try to use as few turns as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example interaction:
Alexa: Ok our starting number is 12345 and our target number is 5 [you selected a 5-digit game]
You: 15 [sum of the digits]
Alexa: 159 [same digits with a &lsquo;9&rsquo; appended]
You: 14 [product of the digits]
Alexa: 5 [sum of the digits --- matches target number, Alexa wins]
