                </h2>
                <p>
                    In college I have weird 50 minute slots of time in between classes when it wouldn't make sense to walk all the way back to my dorm, but at the same time 50 minutes is a long wait. I would love to be able to meet up with friends who are also free during this time, but don't want to text every single friend asking if they are free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users of Toggle can open up the website whenever they are free and click on the hour time slot they are in. Toggle then provides a list of suggestions for what to do. All the events entered for that time will show up on the right side of the screen.
Everyone is welcome to add to the events on Toggle and each school could have it's own version so that we all make the most of our free time on campus, by meeting new people and learning about new communities we might not have run into otherwise.

                    I learned and built in JavaScript in 36 hours!!

                    24 arrays was not the way to go - object arrays are a life-saver.
