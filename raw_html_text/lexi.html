                    For individuals with dyslexia and dyslexia and other reading disabilities, every word can be a struggle. According to the American Dyslexia Association, as many as 40 Million Americans suffer from dyslexia, most of whom have not been diagnosed.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the vast majority will never receive treatment, either because testing is too expensive, or because they simply don't know that they have a treatable condition. These individuals are told that they're stupid, lazy, or just not trying hard enough, when the reality is that they have a medical condition which can be treated, though not cured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In particular, children from low-income backgrounds are among the most affected, because they lack access to the educational and medical resources that are critical to managing reading disabilities. Without the professional support and reading strategies that come with diagnosis, undiagnosed students lag behind their peers, as they struggle to learn from books and communicate their ideas to others. These students simply fall through the cracks.

                    a mobile keyboard application that allows teachers to identify students that may have dyslexia in an easy and cost-effective way. Lexi keeps track of the spelling mistakes made by students while typing on their cell phones and parses those mistakes, harnessing machine learning and statistical analysis to identify error patterns that may indicate dyslexic tendencies.
