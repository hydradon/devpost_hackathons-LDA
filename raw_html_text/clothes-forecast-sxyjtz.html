                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every school day starts with my kids waking up and saying "Alexa, what's the weather?". After they get the low for the day, they come into my room to wake me up and ask what they should wear based on the low temperature of the day. I decided that Alexa could do a better job of determining if a low of 27 meant it was too cold for shorts, so I developed Clothes Forecast.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Clothes Forecast skill will first determine the weather based on the zip code of the Alexa device. It finds the minimum temperature for the next twelve hours, and then tells you what types of clothes to wear based on that temperature. The skill will tell you long pants, short pants, long sleeves, short sleeves, jacket, or coat all based on your settings for what to wear at certain temperatures. After the skill determines what clothes to wear, Alexa will tell you a short summary of the weather and then what clothes should be worn for the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Clothes Forecast
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some feedback from customers have mentioned that there really isn't a need to communicate the weather, and the skill should just report back what clothes to wear. A future release of the skill will add additional customization so weather reporting can be turned on/off based on user preference.
