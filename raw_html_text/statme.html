                    is currently replaying the Suns/Grizzlies and Nets/Jazz games from last night, so choose players from those teams and watch their stats update as if you were watching last night. Note that if a player is on the bench, their stats will naturally not update. For someone who likely has some playing time, take a look at PJ Tucker or Gordon Heyward.
