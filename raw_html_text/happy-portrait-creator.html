                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Engulfed in the mundane activities of the millennia life, people often forget the power of a simple smile. Hence, we developed a happy portrait creator, that turns your frowns into hilarious happy faces. The absurd paintings induce a sense of ridicule and as a result, the funny version of your own face makes you smile :) 
Works on reverse psychology ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Captures an image of your face, and outputs a happy painting of your face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the face recognizer using a conditional generative adversarial network on keras using tensforflow as backend. The facial features were then mapped on to a new image with a smile, thus creating your beautiful happy portrait. We used ktinker for building the GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dataset collection was a major challenge. We created our own dataset, hence the number of the available samples were too less to extract complicated features. We outgrew this by augmenting our dataset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were finally able to create a handful of data samples, and extract features with limited computational power.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Augmenting data helps. GAN's are amazing feature extractors.
