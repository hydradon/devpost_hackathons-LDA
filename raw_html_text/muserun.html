                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that we must combine our daily hobby of listening to music and our exercise. We noticed that people take their music for granted, and the incentive to listen to music would help people feel encouraged.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MuseRun helps motivate others to keep running without stopping. In order to ensure others keep running, we make music from iTunes play only when the person with the phone runs faster than a certain speed. If they slow down or pause, the music stops; this motivates people to constantly run to hear the soothing music.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using CoreLocation and Swift and used velocity to measure whether one is running or not

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges such as design aspects and also being introduced into the aspects of CoreLocation and how it works.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we communicated well throughout the 24 hours. We worked well together to complete our app: MuseRun. We set goals for ourselves every hour and we tried to complete them to the best of our ability.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On our journey, we learned more features of Swift and CoreLocation. We made sure to distribute work among our teammates and learned important aspects of teamwork. All in all, this was a great learning experience.

                    What's next for MuseRun
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add a full leaderboard and a friend system while fixing some of the bugs currently in the app.
