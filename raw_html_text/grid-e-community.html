                    This goal of this app is to help cut down electricity usage by informing users how much they are spending and  advising them as to how they can cut these costs down by doing things like replacing  energy inefficient appliances .The community is ty of users offers up their knowledge of individual appliances cost per kwh. In addition the community also provides suggestions as to what things a user can buy or do to improve their energy efficiency based on their current appliances/hardware. Users take inventory of the devices/appliances they currently have . The cost of usage per hour of specific appliances is provided by members of the community rather than the user having to look up the details of every single product they own .   Depending  on how efficient the appliance is compared to other products  , a  different appliance may be suggested to the user that can help cut down user costs . The amount of savings a user could benefit by replacing the item is then displayed.
