                    Driving in today's society is the most commonly used form of transportation of everyday life. However, driving can be very dangerous. One of the most uncomfortable situations behind the wheel is when approaching a four way intersection without a protected left hand turn. 22.2 percent of crashes are a result of this occurrence. Further, approximately 61 percent of crashes that take place while turning or crossing an intersection involve a left-hand turn. We aimed to tackle this problem that could eventually minimize these accidents that are caused by human error. One of the main factors that our project accounts for is the changes in traffic flow and speeding tendencies in each road. Our product is self-teachable as it collects the data of the road it is set up on first and then proceeds to calculate tendencies and create the highest risk free intervals for the vehicles to make a left hand turn. With this technology, we also hope to implement it on service roads with yield signs, as well as entrances to highways. This would also decrease accidents along with traffic. Thanks and Gig'em!
