                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all regular hackathon goers and after going to a few we've noticed some things that can be lacking. Sometimes registration for hackathons is a pain. Making 10 accounts to sign up for 10 hackathons can feel overwhelming to some. So we decided to create a platform that centralizes all of the systems that go into the making of a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This platform is designed to benefit everyone that is involved in hackathons. It can be seen from three different perspectives. Hackers can create an account and then be able to register for hackathons with only one account as well as see if their friends are attending hackathons they're interested in going to. Hackathon organizers would be able to create accounts and create an event for the hackathon and allow students to register for the hackathon through our platform, maintain communication with hackers before and during the event, as well as advertise their event more efficiently by simply providing a link to their page. Employers would be able to see the general interests of hackers at certain hackathons and be able to use demographic information to aid in their recruiting process and help them decide which hackathons they would like to sponsor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application with React.js in the frontend, Node.js in the backend, and MongoDB for our data storage. It's a pretty standard web application where the frontend queries the backend and that pulls from the database and the data is piped and displayed to the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into quite a few frontend bugs that left us stumped for quite some time. Also, we're not very good with design so trying to come up with good UX/UI for this application was quite a struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of our interface. It took us a while to come up with something that we were proud of but we eventually made it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about the in's and out's of frontend development seeing as the backend wasn't particularly complicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for hackTogether
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HackTogether is an application with lots of potential features that can be implemented in the future. Messaging can be implemented to communicate between users. Notifications can be sent to users about upcoming hackathons, friends going to hackathons, sponsor announcements, among others. Devpost could be replaced if we implemented a similar feature into our application. There are numerous ways that the application could go.
