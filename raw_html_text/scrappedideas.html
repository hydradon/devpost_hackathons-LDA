                    It's our first Hackathon and we both wanted to try web development. We noticed during the idea jams many people had half an idea and wanted other input on it, so we thought it would be cool to have this concept turned into a website. Right now all it does is have one person draw part of something, and someone else finish the drawing, but we believe it can extended to other types of ideas as well.
