                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1/6 people will have a stroke in their life - an enormous percentage. A diagnostic tool to help stroke patients monitor their condition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracks the progress of post-stroke patients through a series of Fugl Meyer tests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Android Studio to build the frontend and the TensorFlow Lite Posenet library to track the video of an exercise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of problems trying to integrate TensorFlow Lite into Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managed to build a clean app and develop a simple algorithm to take the Posenet data and convert it to something the patient could understand.
 ## What we learned
We learned about stroke recovery.

                <p>
                    Implement more tests and use posenet.
