                    Inspiration

                    <li>
                        Everyone can contribute to helping the environment by recycling at almost no cost, but this is limited by lack of knowledge of recyclability of waste items
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many smart bin solutions based on object detection and item separation have high set up cost, or inconveniences users with sensor and mechanical lags
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aim is to better inform users about recyclability of waste items, without becoming obtrusive, disruptive or inconvenient
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Build better recycling habits through encouragement and positive incentivisation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Companies are keen to support eco-friendly initiatives &ndash; can promote partnerships with companies through reward schemes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        New waste items/packaging arrive daily, so traditional rulebased classification methods not sufficient. We need a generalised data-driven method (hence DNN).

                        after each waste item is thrown in the bin, device keeps track of whether items are correctly recycled or not....
