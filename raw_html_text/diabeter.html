                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Design wise it was built using Adobe XD
Software wise it was built with React Native and Redux
For food detection we used Google Vision API
For nutritional values we used Nutrition API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Vision API was returning
                    <em>
                        "It's a picture of food"
                    </em>
                    most of the time.
Also designing something that wasn't too harsh for the programmers so we, designers, had to make some cuts to it. Turns out it made the app better and more understandable for users.

                <p>
                    Simple design even Matthew's mom could understand.
Working food recognition.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Less is more.
Fun tricks in React Native.
Google Vision API is easier than we expected.
Sleep is important, even if you get just two hours it's still better than nothing.

                    What's next for DiaBeter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add a system that would estimate glucose level in blood based on what did the user eat, drink and what physical activity is he going to do, that way the app would be able to remind them to eat something more if the glucose level would be too low.
(For example, Matthew's mom knows she has to eat more carbs (SJ) or inject less insulin before she goes to do something more physically demanding for example cleaning the windows. Fatigue on the edge of the window isn't fun).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add a system that would let doctors change the patient's medical plan  based on his food intake and glucose levels without the need for the patient to come to the doctor. (This doesn't necesarrily have to be for diabetes only, it can be for lactose intolerance or allergies or etc.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add a system that would recommend healthier foods for the less healthy foods in the patient's diet.
                </p>
