                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    It is a common problem for undergraduates in universities to find research opportunities, especially in university, SUNY Stony Brook. Therefore, we wanted to develop a web app to facilitate undergraduate involvement in research projects across disciplines by providing a direct undergraduate-to-researcher interface.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What it does...
                </h1>
                <p>
                    It allows undergraduate students to directly contact graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and principal investigators to participate in their research projects. Researchers are able to post availabilities in various research projects to their department webpage and undergraduate students can browse this webpage to find areas of interest. This, we hope, could be used to decrease the overall time cost of searching for opportunities felt by students and researchers.

                <h1>
                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We used html, css and JavaScript for front-end and php to save the data as .csv file.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Front-end developer in this project had little experience with front-end and back-end developer had no experience with back-end especially php.
We were hungry --&gt; Brains malfunctioned at approximately 4AM.

                <h1>
                    Accomplishment that we are proud of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We got to make some portion of the webpage even though we started to build this after finishing a small hardware project. We learned new languages!
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Whats next for ResearchFind
                </h1>
                <p>
                    A few pages still have to be done. Resume file has to be able to saved on the server. We have to load the research .csv file to the website probably using JavaScript or php.
