                    Have you ever been to a restaurant and could not decide what to order? Or have you ever ordered a dish and thought afterwards that you should better have ordered another dish instead?
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the DishRater App you can see ratings for all the dishes served in a restaurant. The app will show you the best dish or give you a recommendation based on your rating history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the Deutsche Bank API your purchase is verified to ensure that the rating is from a real customer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This way, the DishRater is not only useful for customers, but for restaurant owners as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An additional feature of the App could, after enough data has been collected, be a subscription for restaurant owners, who can get access to the rating history of their dishes and detailed statistics for all their meals even in comparison to other restaurants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having access to the rating history of the dishes will make it easily possible for the restaurant owners to evaluate the quality of the meals they are offering to their customers and it will also be possible for them to determine whether the quality of their dishes is constant or changing over time.
