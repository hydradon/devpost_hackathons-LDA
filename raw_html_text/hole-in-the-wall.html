                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Certainly, the original idea came from the game show. We felt that it had incredible potential as a party game that anyone could play from anywhere, and there was great appeal to watch your friends embarrass themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Somehow motivates you to contort your body into inhuman positions for virtual points (and good laughs). Includes both single player and local multiplayer. Disclaimer: We are not liable for any injuries sustained from aforementioned inhuman body contortions.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML5 + vanilla js + accidental lodash
Nothing fancy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Webcam auto-adjustments interfered with image processing
Lack of computer vision libraries for javascript.
Inflexible joints.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Increased coding and physical agility.
Making a fun and (mostly) working game that we had a blast testing (read: playing).
Sustaining injuries is now more fun than ever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Webcams are not to be trifled with.
Hackathons are not conducive environments for clean and dry code.
                </p>

                    What's next for Hole in the Wall
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More advanced and accurate image processing.
Optimize performance of algorithm.
Yoga endorsements.
