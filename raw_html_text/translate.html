                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How do we think differently from machines? From people of other cultural backgrounds/languages? Something as simple as a computer could actually be &ldquo;electric brain&rdquo;, as it is in Chinese. What if we could simultaneously see something expressed in multiple languages? We decided to investigate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You upload an image. Our program will use computer vision to identify what it is and then tell you what it means in other languages!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using flask, with integrated Google&rsquo;s Cloud Vision and Natural Language APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have experience with hosting online servers (i.e. using Flask) so we had a lot to learn!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are especially proud of our back-end development. It was much harder than we expected, but through a long series of struggles and bothering our mentors, we pulled it through in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned so much, including how to host an online server, how to use GCP and how to web development with HTML. More importantly though, we learned that new learning things for our project on the spot can be quite rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for translate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can implement voice callback to not only display the word, but also pronounce it. Additionally, we can integrate human emotions instead of the program just reading a person's face as "face".
