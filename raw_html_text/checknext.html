                <p>
                    Take a picture of a checkers board (from a large range of angles/tilts), and receive reccomendation on your next move, which is conveyed visually on your picture.

                    OpenCV, tape, checkers board (s), pink sticky notes

                        Setting up the board detection (specifically, transforming the image to only look at the board)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Square detection, due to the large amount of noise on the faux wood board, and some lens flares
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        First time with OpenCV/computer vision

                    <li>
                        Colors of board/pieces are very similar, so had to do some image processing

                        a better move heuristic (have seen some example checkers algorithms that use minimax that seem relatively easy to implement)
