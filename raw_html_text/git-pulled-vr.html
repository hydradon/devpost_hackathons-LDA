                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The opportunity of being able to use the Rift and leap motion provides our team enough reason to be inspired to make an awesome game. VR has always been our topic of interest. We see VR as being the next big thing in the upcoming years and having the chance to develop skills using both pieces of hardware drives us to continue to learn more about the tools.

                <p>
                    Git Pulled VR is a virtual reality experience that introduces a new type of mechanic, player movement and grappling capabilities. With the combined powers of the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion, our game brings out the full experience of clinging from wall to wall and swinging across multitudes of platforms. With the added virtual obstacle, the player can have fun grappling their way to the finish line, allowing them to experience the full virtual experience.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to create Git Pulled VR we relied heavily on making the mechanics functional. Our game emphasizes on our complex c# scripts that are used to make the movement and grapple possible.  All our assets we made entirely in Unity3D, and our course was made as the playground for the player to enjoy the use of the grapple.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time is always an issue when it comes to this kind of project. Most of our time was based on re-creating physics so our player can have a
                    <strong>
                        real
                    </strong>
                    grappling experience.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a unique feeling that can only be experienced in VR. We were able to sync our controller into Unity, which controlled movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Unity, and how its objects act relative to each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Git Pulled VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on cleaning up the physics, making the controls feel tighter and more slick. We also plan on adding more levels and potentially a combat system. We may also try to add custom models for objects instead of the pre-built ones we are currently using.
