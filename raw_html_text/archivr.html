                    Even the most prestigious construction projects run out of planned budget &amp; time. That's because nobody can predict all future project' details for planning. Construction process and its front edge part; Building Information Modeling (BIM), needs improvement as technology is moving forward fast. And we would like to work on it's least noticed aspect: planning. That's where VRanner can be a great help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    VRanner stands for VR and Planner. Not only it combines BIM with VR, but also improves the planning phase. Before anything being constructed, VRanner plunge decision makers into real-life experience of future stages of construction progress. This helps them to notify future problems &amp; difficulties that they will encounter, if they don't prevent them from the beginning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To develop VRanner, our most effort went into implementation of BIM model with Unity. Then we customized Unity assets to simulate construction phases of a our model. Meanwhile, we equipped it with teleportation. This feature eases navigation inside large site-works.

                    Our biggest challenge was time shortage, especially that our group was formed only 12 hours before the deadline. But we are proud of our time-management skill, dedicated team members, and the creative idea that we could work on during this short amount of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Combination of BIM-based planning and VR opens many new opportunities for further work, each can improve different aspect of building process: improving profit-margin, planning, and safety during the work.
