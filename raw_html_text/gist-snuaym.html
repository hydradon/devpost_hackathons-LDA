                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today's global economy it's easier than ever to have the food we want, whenever we want it. Take these berries for example, they taste great... but do we know where they're from? I don't. And that's an issue, we don't know the environmental impact of these berries, nor if they're a local product or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's where GISt comes in,
                    <strong>
                        to let us get the GISt of where our food comes from
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GISt allows you to gather more information about your preferred produce through a fun, colorful, and interactive AR experience. This allows consumers to better understand the
                    <strong>
                        health and environmental impact
                    </strong>
                    of their purchases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GISt is powered by the
                    <strong>
                        Vuforia API
                    </strong>
                    via Unity3D. To design the program, our UX/UI researcher drafted multiple prototypes and created user stories in
                    <strong>
                        Axure RP 8
                    </strong>
                    . These were built in Unity3D with C#. Maps, GIS data, and farm data is pulled via the
                    <strong>
                        OSIsoft API
                    </strong>
                    , JavaScript, JSON, and
                    <strong>
                        MapBox
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were multiple complications with
                    <strong>
                        Android SDK integration
                    </strong>
                    and Java JDK errors that prevented an Android build from functioning. However, the team was still able to push through and get a working, better-than-minimum-viable-product prototype to demonstrate the key mechanics and functions GISt has to offer.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a quick
                    <strong>
                        AR environment
                    </strong>
                    , supported by a well-reasoned and
                    <strong>
                        intuitive User eXperience
                    </strong>
                    was a new challenge for us, and it definitely pushed us to innovate and think critically on how people use applications such as ours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interacting with the
                    <strong>
                        OSIsoft, MapBox, and Vuforia APIs
                    </strong>
                    helped us expand ourselves on very diversified aspects of computer science and cognitive science.

                    What's next for GISt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to get a
                    <strong>
                        functioning mobile port
                    </strong>
                    of GISt to make the product even more versatile. We also hope to research this area in an entrepreneurial sense to see if companies are interested in such farm-to-table innovations.
