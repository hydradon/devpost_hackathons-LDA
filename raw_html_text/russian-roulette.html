                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all like party games, don't we? We took the famous game Russian Roulette and adapted it to the modern era, making it work on Amazon Alexa. Take risks, bet and win!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application follows the rules of the famous Russian Roulette rules. Connecting every player to an Nessie account, we raised the bar with virtual betting, each player having an account which allows him to take risks and feel the excitement of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built using JavaScript. We integrated the Nessie API within our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having no previous experience with some of the technologies and languages we used, we had trouble making them work together. (e.g. using JavaScript requests for the Nessie API)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning from mistakes is always the biggest accomplishment at any Hackathon. We managed to correct the errors and fix the bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are willing to continue the development of the Amazon Alexa skill and make the game more complex and user friendly.
