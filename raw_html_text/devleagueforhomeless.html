                <h3>
                    What it does
                </h3>
                <p>
                    People with a cellphone or smartphone can take a picture of a homeless person and report that location so that government services can locate these people and provide aid for them.

                    How we built it
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We created a server with Express.js and created the referrals and pictures database with PostgreSQL. We connected the data to the front end using Pug and styled with Sass. We are using Twilio for converting text messages into incoming data. We also use cloudinary for our image hosting service. We also use google maps for the geolocation maps.
                </p>
                <h3>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Creating a user friendly website that can help the homeless and the state.
