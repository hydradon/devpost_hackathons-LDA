                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration for Mr button hit me when I was about to take a nap at this event. A trickle of paranoia set in and that's when it struck me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app takes gyroscopic data and if it's moved after it's initially been armed (assuming the movement exceed the threshold), it sets off an alarm. The app does function while the phone is locked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with Android Studios. A few different YouTube tutorials on how to interact with the gyroscope and media player libraries, and plenty of frustration during debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges I ran into was when My old team decided to disband and go our own ways since our original project was too difficult. This left me with less than half the original amount of time left to come up with an idea, and build it. Another challenge I ran into was outdated documentation that ended in me having to redo significant sections of my code. Another challenge i ran into was finding out that a part of the program I made will only work under un-ideal conditions, causing me to redesign a small portion of the behavior of my app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to make something that I set my mind too. I was able to picture something in my mind, and then make it into a reality within a timely manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that sometimes libraries and code don't behave like you intend them to. I also learned that it's easy to bite off more than one can chew when they aren't aware of their own restrictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mr Button
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mr Button will be going home with me. Mr Button may be worked on and turned into something a bit more complex than a motion detector.
