                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The day before yesterday was my birthday. I felt like every year I would make some birthday wishes, but I would forget about they soon. So I would love some beautiful, personal space to record all my birthday wishes every year. This will also help me to reflect on my growth.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a website called "Birthday Records." It has a sign up page. After signing up, the user will type in his/her wishes. The website then records and displays the wishes. If the user makes an mistake when entering wishes, s/he can edit.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built wrote it in Text-wangler, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I wrote it from scratch (didn't use templates or frameworks).

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    I am very new to web development, so a lot of syntax/debugging...

                <p>
                    This is my first time building a web app from scratch, so I'm proud of everything!

                    What's next for Birthday Records
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I currently don't know any backend development, so next step would be setting up a backend database to keep secure all the user information.
