                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a tool which was useful, while still making the best out of the hackathon to learn and challenge ourselves with new technologies. Inspiration was mainly from the new trends of bots for companies and we wanted to see and experience how to create one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Buddy Bot is a friend, through normal conversation it would be able to set up unified reminders for you. What makes us different from your typical reminder tool is the media we are using,
Facebook Messenger, which allows us to alert you from your desktop to phones to smart devices all in one place, all at once, easily.  Will be able t notify for healthy activities and regular breaks when on device for too long to increase mental awareness and physical activity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to create a Facebook bot using Flask &amp; wit.ai. By using Heroku and using Flask we were able to start creating a basic bot after we started using wit.ai which allowed us to improve the communications with the bot and user
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many problems with getting the apis to work, messenger crashing multiple times and having troubles with stopping the reminder that the bot would be pushing.
As well we had to work with python threading and as well using python timers and events to emulate javascript set interval
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made our first messenger bot that works and has many functions. On top, we created a website to market the bot and allow users to easily just log in to messenger and use our bot all in 37 hours. We are proud to learn all these technologies and challenged ourselves by stepping out of our comfort zone instead of taking the safe route and using the technologies we are familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many technologies that are very different from what we have learnt in the past such as

                    <li>
                        Javascript
## What's next for Buddy Bot
We have many plans with Buddy Bot like introducing these notifications for doctors appointments, medicines, groceries as well different feeds of new exercises and partnering with physical companies like Nike to produce better content for the user and more variety towards a healthy living.
