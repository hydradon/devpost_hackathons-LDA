                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always wanted to make a game because I love Kingdom Hearts. This is the start of me learning more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You race against each other in a very competitive scene.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used scratch and learned to make in 6 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were making another game, but started to run out of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're happy that we finally came out with an actual product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's more to making a game than just wanting to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Momentum
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make a top down RPG similar to the game Heartbound with hours of gameplay.
