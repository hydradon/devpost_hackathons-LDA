                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the great platform - Open Bazaar, if you haven't heard of it &ndash; check it out!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets anyone create their own shop on top of the IPFS forked network. They are independent and there is no control over their shop. There is no central control over the platform.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since there is no control over the participants of the platform and it wasn't built for profit, it is currently viewed as a "shady" market where there is very few trust between users.
But our major issue is that now users of Open Bazaar
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've made the mobile version of Open Bazaar, since it is currently only available for computers. We've made it available for people with disabilities using IOS voice over. Current version of the Open Bazaar has to be downloaded on the computer which gives users the access to the hosting servers, while on mobile phones we will have to hold a server for them, for which they will pay a fee, which can work as monetisation option.
This way we provide our users on-demand Open Bazaar servers which host their own store and allow them to make purchases in other stores located on the platform. 
We've counted the approximate cost that users will have to pay for using Open Bazaar  mobile. The cost of the average server rental for a month is about 10$, it can serve about 200 people a month, assuming that the average user spends 28 minutes on Open Bazaar/month (data is taken from the Amazon statistics). And our charge per user per minute will be approximately 5 cents (including our fees) which will bring the total price that the user pays on average every month to 1.5$
