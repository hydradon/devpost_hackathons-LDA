                    The team found itself playing around with the idea of Langwave after hearing of the theme of "improving communication", as well as based on the knowledge that the team was interested in using the Discord.py API. Langwave reads the messages of each member of a Discrord server. After an admin selects a target language for the sever, all messages not in the target language are translated automatically to the target language via a follow-up message made by the Langwave bot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team built Langwave using the googletrans API, a free API that implements the Google Translate API, as well as the Discord API. These APIs lended themselves towards Python. The team divided jobs amongst themselves and updated their progress via a GitHub repository.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team was particularly challenged by making the bot compatible with multiple servers without the data from one server overwriting the next one. Additionally, one of the team members had no prior experience with Python, and more than one had no experience with the Discord.py API, so these concepts needed to be learned on the fly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team prides the robustness of the solution that they developed in such a short time. While some of the team have had prior hackathon experience, the team is mostly still rather new to them, and generally found it difficult to deliver a product in a short time span.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team learned about Python, Discord.py API, googletrans API, what it takes to implement an API, and how to use file I/O to save settings/configuration for the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Langwave could be improved by transcending Discord as its sole platform, and being implemented in such a way as to be able to use on several different examples of chat room software, such as Skype or Snapchat. The team could also replace googletrans, a free API, with a stronger API that is able to translate what the users say more accurately to what they mean, and not try to translate gibberish.
