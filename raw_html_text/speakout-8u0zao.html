                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got inspirated by the idea of a fast and anonymous chat
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SpeakOut is a web-based chat that allows you to create public or private temporal rooms. The main features of SpeakOut are logless connection and no permanent storage of the data from the room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js and RethinkDB as the back-end, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front-end.
We used socket.io to connect our front-end with our back-end in order to interactuate with the user in-real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using correctly the Socket.io library and connecting the data base to the front end. The documentation was not that long and not even that half well explained, for the DB problems, we just need some practise in this field.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically all of it. It works, maybe it is not 100% what we wanted to do originally but it was still a good challenge to accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Node.js and NoSQL databases to create the backend and HTML, CSS and JavaScript to modelate the frontend.
                </p>

                    What's next for SpeakOut
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Introducing voice, and even video, to the chat. The ability to transfer files, images...
