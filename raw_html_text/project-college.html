                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the big boom of social media, a lack in face to face interaction has increased. With our observations of not seeing many students going to receive help from their professors or creating industry relationships, we were eager to develop an app. This app would be the stepping stone to solving some or all of these issues.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    While implementing the code that controls switching between the features on the watch, we ran into compile issues. We also came across coding the output and not successfully implementing Ajax within our program to clear up all the words from this part of the code.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully created our first watchapp with the Pebble.js platform We also created our first github repository.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create an app. We designed and developed this app using JavaScript. We learned how to put our software projects on github.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our steps for improving our Buddy app is to add motion gesture controls for faster seamless functionality, so one will not need to press the button. Buddy will gain recording functionality to help the user improve their  ongoing communication with industry, professors and friends.
