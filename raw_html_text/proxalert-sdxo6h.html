                    ProxAlert is a Pebble app developed for Hack the Planet 2015 in Mountain View, CA by Ty Morris.

                <h2>
                    Objective
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the application is to provide immediate alert to a Pebble user who leaves the vicinity of their phone without explicitly denying its aid.

                <h3>
                    Technology
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The impressive component of this project (in my opinion) is the technology required to make it work, rather than the product itself. It was very much a hack job.
None of the traditional distance-measuring tools were at my disposal, so in order to determine when a user leaves their phone I had to finely tune the communication methods provided by the (small) Pebble API to use packet latency as a measure for distance. The result is essentially a reconstruction of the ping system using a pebble watch and android phone as two nodes connected only through Bluetooth (which has no distance or wave strength accessors!)
I found this hack to be very rewarding when it finally worked.
