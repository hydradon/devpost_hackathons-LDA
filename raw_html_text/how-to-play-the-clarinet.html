                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    domain.com gave me a free domain, so I had to use it somehow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was supposed to have content but the site won't link to the GitHub project I made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Threw together some rudimentary HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The domain won't point to my page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought of the pun
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Domain names take time to propagate
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for How to Play the Clarinet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I shall patiently wait until it propagates.
