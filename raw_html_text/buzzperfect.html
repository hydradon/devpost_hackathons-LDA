                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use IOS and a Myo for the purpose of getting data points to appear on a screen was the primary focus of our hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By utilizing a Myo gesture control band, we were able to track the movements of the arm and plot the position of the Myo in realtime on an iPhone screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed all the swift code in Xcodec, downloaded the SDK for the Myo Gesture Control Band, and utilized Affinity in order to make our logo/app icon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transferring the data from the Myo to the swift function that would allow for the dots to be placed on the screen and determining the axis of rotation of the device in relation to the readings on our screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Without any prior knowledge of programming in Swift and using a Myo, the fact that we were able to make multiple advancements was great in our eyes. Our main priority was to come to HackFSU and learn how to develop IOS apps and utilize the Myo. To our surprise, we were able to do both, even when others doubted us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the swift programming language and how to use the Myo armband.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BuzzPerfect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many applications for our Hack such as robotics: machine learning in terms of accuracy and precision; sports: optimization of athletic form; Physical Therapy: Helps Doctors evaluate their patients range of motion.
