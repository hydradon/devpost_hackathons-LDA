                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration was one day I was looking at careers and couldn't find something that had it all. SOOOOOO, I decided to make one myself.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes you to a quiz and depending on the score you got, it gives you an industry. Then, you go back to the app and go to the page with all the different industries. You can either pick an industry or the one that you got on the quiz and start exploring all the different opportunities that you have.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Thunkable which is a free app-building website that connects to your phone when you download the app and sign into you account.  I used buttons and rows and the internet to make it the way i wanted it to be.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I made the quiz, there wasn't a lot of options for the kind of quiz maker that I wanted.

                <p>
                    I got all the websites in and finished the bases of the app.

                    How to link websites into Thunkable to show up on the phone.

                    Probably make it bigger and with more industries. And a better quiz.
