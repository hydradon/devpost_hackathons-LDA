                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made it because of the realization that these functions that can be performed are very handy for math.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can perform all of the order of operations, Solve a quadratic equation, and graph a line based off of two coordinates on the Cartesian Plane.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i asked for a series of inputs, first asking them which one they wanted to do, then entering the specific values based on the task, and finally I used to input to carry out the task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge I ran into was the quadratic formula, because I didn't use the correct formatting or grouping for the formula at the beginning, and it took me a few tries to fix it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm happy that I managed to successfully run the Quadratic Formula 100% of the time. It took a little bit of time, but i eventually got there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about how the split function was used with input(). I also learned that you can put several variables in a single input() line, and use them alongside the split function to get two outputs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, I'm going to make an interface using PyQt5 and Qt Designer, which will most likely look like a calculator. Alongside the interface, I will probably put more tasks in, such as standard deviation.
