                    My cousin's not a big reader, and while she still has time, the prospect of having to spend hours poring over flashcards trying to remember arcane words she'll never seen before intimidates her. However, she loves speech and debate, and reads newspaper and other articles online quite often. At the same time, if she happens upon a word she doesn't know, she probably won't look it up in a dictionary, as she's invested in whatever she is reading and will piece together some meaning of the word. This is fine for the moment, but she ends up not learning the word.
That point is where my team and I decided to help. We created a google chrome extension that highlights all the words that appear in a quizlet set, of the user's choosing -- it can be one of theirs or one of the many public ones available -- in whatever webpage the user is reading. This way, they are reminded that these words are ones they need to know, and they can gradually learn the meaning and remember to look them up after reading the article. 
We hope this tool helps students of all ages and backgrounds, and even those who speak different languages, learn more vocabulary, as this extension can be used for quizlet sets in other languages as well, and we plan on putting on the Chrome Web Store. Thanks!
