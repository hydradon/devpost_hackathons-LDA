                <p>
                    I was watching a podcast late last night, when the hosts started going through random Urban Dictionary words, and asking each other what they think the definition of said word was. It resulted in some funny conversations, so I decided to make it easier to do.

                <p>
                    UrbanDicts is a guessing game that scrapes Urban Dictionary for words, along with their definitions, and asks the user to attempt to guess select the definition that matches. Just because it's for TerribleHacks, there's also a built-in cheat button that opens up the word's page on the
                    <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com" rel="nofollow">
                        Urban Dictionary site
                    </a>
                    ! To convince the user not to cheat, they're penalized by the sound of a crowd booing at them for their sins.
