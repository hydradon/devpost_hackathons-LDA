                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing as we are currently at a hackathon, where people generally sit around without having much physical activity, our group realized the importance of having an app that would encourage people to go out and walk more often.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows the users to log into the app on Facebook, find friends that are already using the app, and then compete in a competition where the person with the most steps at the end of the week earns a dollar per person, winner take all. The app also takes into account people with bank accounts by linking the checking accounts to the app, allowing the money transfer to occur immediately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the project was built using Java with the Android Studio IDE. We had a total of three android devices in order to test and debug.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    POST requests with the Nessie API were very obscure with very little information dispersed in the internet. Two out of the four members on our team were not in a computer science/electrical engineering major, so our skill sets were thinned. Fatigue is always a factor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an app that works! We incorporated multiple APIs, taught each other several different concepts, used git for project management, and bonded together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Start small, then add features. Stock up on more red bull next time. Ask for more mentor help and sleep the night before the hackathon.
                </p>

                    What's next for Walk or Pay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a lobby in which people can create and add team members into competitions, having better structures in order to make the application scalable, implement security in order to prevent data breaches.
