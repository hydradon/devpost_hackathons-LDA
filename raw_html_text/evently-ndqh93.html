                    The problem: How many times have you heard of an event, but only missed attending it by a couple of days? UC Santa Cruz is a large and diverse campus. Sometimes, it can be a challenge to find local events that are happening in our community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer: Our team built Evently. With Evently, users can post a new event happening in their area. If it&rsquo;s an awesome event, people up vote it and lead to new events that are happening in their area.
                </p>

                    The benefit: Let&rsquo;s say that I&rsquo;m an at hackathon event. The user can make a new post, add a title, name, date, and time (Demo). It automatically be posted to new local events in your area, depending on its rating system. With Evently, the local community can increase, or decrease the visibility of their events. This is a great way for small events that happening to be easily discovered and can help spread the word about a good cause.
