                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Video is a great form of media, but it's often to slow and too long. We want a way to find the most important parts of a video, and only watch those parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can submit a video Scribr, and Scribr will automatically find the most important parts of the video, and will provide a brand new video, trimmed to just the important moments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scribr first transcribes the video using the RevSpeech API. Then it does a form of sentiment analysis on the transcribed videos, using NLP, to find the most important sentences. It then finds the timestamps of all of the important videos, and then re-cuts the video to trim down to only those sentences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So many challenges. From installing Python on a windows computer (for a brand new coder!) to automatically trimming videos on a server... we were genuinely shocked the first time the entire process worked, and we played a trimmed video that actually worked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was so seamless, we actually wasn't sure if it worked the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we came together with a diverse skillset, including someone who just learned how to code, and were able to create a real, working system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of us learned to code. The others learned Flask, RevSpeech, how a computationally intense backend system worked, how to work quickly, and how to power through until the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Team Two
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I say dance, they say 'How high?' We're got many more ideas that we want to add to this project. And as soon as we sleep for a week or two, we'll get back to adding them.
