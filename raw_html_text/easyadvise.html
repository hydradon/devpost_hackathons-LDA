                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's so hard to find information on what classes you need to take for your major, we wanted to make something that made it easier to view courses for a specific major, get information on a course, and figure out how long it might take to graduate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to select a major and view classes for it, and information about those classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode and the built in Swift files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nobody knew anything about Xcode before starting the hackathon, so it took us awhile to just figure out how to use Xcode before we could even start coding or designing anything. Because of this, we weren't able to implement everything that we wanted. We were also kind of split up because we had people learning how to use Xcode and other people doing graphics and learning how to use Swift so there was a little bit of discord and we didn't always communicate very well what exactly we were working on which did slow us down a little.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use Xcode and the UI editor in Xcode and being able to put together the basics of an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Xcode, and that before a hackathon it's probably best to have at least a general idea of how to use the software you are planning to use to implement your idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EasyAdvise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more majors and classes, and some other functionality such as being able to input the classes you have already taken, and then calculating how long until graduation or how long until you can take a certain class. We could also add an option to input courses for a minor.
