                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite games to date is Super Mario Maker, which allows you to build your own custom Mario levels. I took this game as inspiration and decided to make my own game creator.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This editor allows for people to create their own sprites and levels for a simple platformer game. Up to ten difference sprites can be used. Also, you can create your own character to create your own adventure!!!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blood, sweat, tears, and LOTS of caffeine. I only got 45 minutes of sleep during this hackathon! I decided to use Java since it is the language that I am most familiar with. I used Java's default GUI "swing" components. I did not use any sort of GUI builder and positioned everything myself. I will admit the code is spaghetti, but it works (somehow).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had quite a bit of trouble getting collision detection to actually work. You have to be pixel perfect if you want your collisions to work. It ended up taking me hours to do get it working. Also, while there are save and load buttons, they do not quite work yet. Loading almost works, but runs into some trouble and forgets all but the last custom sprite.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I even made this. Phew! I am so glad that the program ended up being as nice as it is. I thought that one, I wouldn't be able to finish it, and two, it would be a mess. Now while the code is messy, the program runs extremely smooth.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java may not be the greatest platform to make a game engine XD. However, I learned how to manipulate java into giving me the desired appearance and performance I desired.

                <p>
                    Perhaps I will allow for a top-down game mode. Also, I hope to get that load and save button working!!!
