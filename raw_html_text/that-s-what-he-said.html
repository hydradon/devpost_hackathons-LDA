                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a group of 4 sophomores in high school who have little to no experience with coding. But we wanted to have some fun and learn in the process. We decided to make a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that served as a translator of common things men say and what they really mean. It's meant as a satirical work, not to be taken too seriously. We were inspired by men around us who say these things but don't tell us their real thoughts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The GUI has categories under which phrases men say are located. Upon clicking translate, the "real" meaning shows up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us have no coding experience, but we pushed along using Java. We used Eclipse to code a simple GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to our lack of knowledge in coding, we struggled with some tasks. We had to learn first, before we could code anything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how much we've learned in these past two days. It's incredible to see us making a GUI when before bitcamp some of us did not know what Java was at all!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Java. We also learned how difficult but rewarding coding can be!
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our GUI was meant as a fun, small project. But if people are willing to watch this project and contribute, feel free to message us!
