                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to design an innovative and simple way for women to keep track of their periods, without any complications. Though some people have trouble with graphical user interfaces, voice user interfaces are easy to use and understand for everybody.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to track your period through voice command and answers frequently asked questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Alexa's developer console to code our own program.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn a new programming language and apply it in less than the 24 hour time limit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team is very proud to have been able to develop an understanding of the mechanisms behind Alexa's smart voice control.

                    What's next for Period Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand from menstrual health to also covering other female concerns like breast cancer, diabetes.
