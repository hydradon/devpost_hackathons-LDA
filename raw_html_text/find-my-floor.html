                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to make this website when I saw many people lost when they came to the hackathon. I thought, "Wouldn't it be great if there was an application that had the location of all the rooms in a building." So with this, I decided to make the website Find my Floor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website currently displays the floor plan of any floor in Minkao that the user enters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the program by coding a website using html, CSS, and Javascript. First, I found the pictures of the floor plans in Minkao and added them to the website. Then, I coded an input and submit box to get the user's input. Lastly, based on the input, the correct floor plan is displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge I ran into was not having enough time to learn html, CSS and Javascript to make the website more usable. Initially I wanted to highlight the room that the user inputs, but I was unable to find an efficient way to do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of being able to get a start on the website and having something to work on and build. I was also impressed with the amount of information that I learned in the past two day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to code a website in html and CSS. I also learned how to use Javascript to read input from the website and display a new page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Find my Floor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, I want to be able to find a room on a floor and show it to the user. After I am done with one building, I want to expand to a majority of building on campus. I believe there are many things that can be added to the website, and with time the website will grow.
