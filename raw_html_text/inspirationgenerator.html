                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't think of an idea. Then we thought about how that's the most important part of any project, coming up with an idea. So, we came up with a way to help people come up with ideas.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It pulls a bunch of random words and their definitions off Dictionary.com, then concatenates the words and their definitions such that it creates a syntactically correct new definition that the user can pull inspiration from.
                </p>
                <h2>
