                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an .io type massively multiplayer online game with a twist - Twitch Plays!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the players control a single car; the degree of steering is determined by the average of everyone's input. Players are randomly distributed to 2 teams, good and evil. The good players win if the car safely reaches the end of the track, while the evil players win if the car crashes into an obstacle or drives out of bounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js and Express for the back-end framework and used HTML Canvas and JavaScript for the user interface and animations. We used socket.io for the client-server communications.
                </p>
