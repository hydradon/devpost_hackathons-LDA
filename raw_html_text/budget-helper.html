                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all know how to create a budget, but some of us may need some help in understanding our financial behavior and how it relates to our budget. Having a tool to do so could dramatically change how we treat our money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In essence, this is a web application that allows users to understand how they can save more money and act on that knowledge. Users can enter the amount they plan to budget for a given month and enter the total transactions for each week. With this information, an estimate of available balance is given and users can determine whether they are above or within budget. The app also provides tips and coupons that consumers can use when they plan to buy something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded the application using Java and the NetBeans 8.2 IDE.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of us did not have much experience with GUIs before this Hack-a-thon. However, we were able to learn on the job using resources like Stack Overflow.

                    <li>
                        being able to make a whole project from scratch within the time frame
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        learning a new programming language (for some of our team members)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        gaining a deeper understanding of the time limit.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only did we learn about technical skills such as Linear Regression and GUI development, but we also learned that it's important to take breaks and focus on something else when needed. That way, we were able to come up with more creative solutions faster.
