                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably, a good way to keep farmed shrimp healthy and free of disease, is to give them an appropriate pond to live in by regularly monitoring and adjusting the pH, salinity, temperature, and other parameters. On a large shrimp farm with many ponds, going to every single pond and manually checking things is a pain, so we strive to use inexpensive automated electronic sensors to collect data, and an easily-deployable virtual server to collate it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using ordinary HTTP 'GET' requests, an arduino-based probe with an array of sensors and Wi-Fi can 'phone home' to a Shrimpwatch server, which uses PHP scripts to process incoming data. The Shrimpwatch server thus keeps track of an array of shrimp ponds' monitorable parameters. The end user can then access the webserver from almost any internet-enabled device and see live updates of the stats in their ponds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By starting with a Bitnami 'lampstack' virtual machine in VMWare, we short-cutted a lot of the setup of an Apache webserver running PHP with a MySQL database. We then used Arduino components to create a prototype sensor device to provide sample data to the application, and created an attractive and functional web front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wrestling with the various required Debian services and daemons took longer than expected, from our unfamiliarity with Linux administration and setup. We also struggled with PHP and SQL syntax, needing a lot of trial-and-error to make scripts work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of "I know this is possible, I just need to figure out how to do it" moments, and most of our work could be adapted and expanded for other applications in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for shrimpwatch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The webserver currently lacks any authentication or security hardening, and is wildly inappropriate for a live web-facing environment. Our hardware side also needs a true prototype with sensors, and lots of research on the reliability and precision of the sensors themselves. Beyond this, there are many potential quality-of-life features to implement.
