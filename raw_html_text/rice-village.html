                </h2>

                    Makes the website more appealing and more user-interactive

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML and CSS, and using a pixel app on the ipad to create images, and photoshop to create GIFs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not familiar with CSS at all, had to learn everything. Also when the browser page is small, the images are slightly moved but still usable and appealing. Also we only had 2 people and ran out of time to make the adjustment for this and some other minor and negligable design changes.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks like what we envisioned.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CSS, how to pull an all-nighter, how to make an interactive image on a website, design project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RICE VILLAGE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The weather in RV could be developed to match the weather in Houston. Rice could hire us to do the whole website if we got paid a lot.
