                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After experiencing the futility of trying to use Facebook groups or messenger to set up pickup basketball games at the RSF, we thought that we should help connect students to other students that are available at given times to also play any given sport.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StreetUp currently does not have much functionality. Users can be registered and public games can be created by every user but connecting users to games still does not fully work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an angular.JS front-end with a Flask-based python back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to change our entire back-end within the last 12 hours because the previous database and backend we were using only supported the creation of user accounts (which helped with registration and logins) but could not store data about the games itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The three of us only came into this hackathon knowing some Python so having to learn almost everything we used from scratch was rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the fundamentals of Node.JS, Angular.JS, sqlAlchemy along with efficient uses of the terminal and text editor thanks to one of our great mentors, Dmitri.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StreetUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to finish creating the app so it's fully functional with user bases and can effectively store the game data.
