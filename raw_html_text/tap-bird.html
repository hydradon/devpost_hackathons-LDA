                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the popular flappy bird game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a game where you tap the screen to get the bird to fly , make it fly thru the pipes while collecting coins. You gain one point each for successfully flying through the pipes and collecting coins. If you touch the ground or hit the pipes , its game over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I played the original game and tried to recreate as many of the features as possible while adding new ones of my own. I tho wished I had more time as I was the solo dev and it was quite a bit of work.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spritekit with swift , less support for swift as it still new , getting collisions to work , the 3d coin effect, getting the background to scroll smoothly , detecting when the bird passes thru the gap without an actual collision.
                </p>
