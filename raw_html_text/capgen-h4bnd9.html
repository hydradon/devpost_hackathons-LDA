                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone struggles to find that perfect caption to a little spice to their Instagram posts. CapGen makes it easier by generating relevant captions from public quotes datasets using Google's Vision API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CapGen uses the Google Vision API to analyze image data and produce certain keywords that are then used to produce random quotes for Instagram captions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using Android Studio and Java. To mock up the wireframe for our app, we used Figma. For the image recognition, we used Google&rsquo;s Vision API, and for quote generation, we sourced quotes, lyrics, and facts from several public datasets such as Wikiquote.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found too large of a dataset for Github to handle. We also had trouble integrating &ldquo;Import from Photo Gallery&rdquo; functionality. However, we overcame those challenges.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this experience, we all learned about the power of visual recognition such as Google&rsquo;s Vision API. We also have a better understanding of what it takes to integrate functionality such as that into an app even as simple as ours. We also maintained a level of camaraderie that helped us to develop solutions for many of our technical and semantic issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CapGen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on developing CapGen further based on the interest shown in it during SwampHacks. We have plans to create a better user interface and to allow for direct uploading of captions to Instagram.
