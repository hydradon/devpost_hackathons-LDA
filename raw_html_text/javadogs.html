                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to JavaDogs!  JavaDogs was inspired by a desire to translate key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in a way that doesn't confuse beginners with complex jargon.  Using a hierarchy of classes written in Java, JavaDogs is meant to guide the user through easy examples of inheritance, demonstrating the development of the hierarchy as the user progresses through each level.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website was created by a team of student developers at the Rochester Institute of Technology&rsquo;s 2017 WiC Hacks hackathon for women. &nbsp;The goal of this project was to convey core principles of Object-Oriented Programming through sample code, visuals, and simple explanations. &nbsp;Java was chosen as the language to be used for sample code due to its popularity among OOP programmers. &nbsp;This website is meant to be accessible and easy-to-understand for both children and adults, with code explanations defining important terms and avoiding jargon that confuse and overwhelm beginner coders.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build the site itself, we used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  All of the Java code and tutorial explanations were written in Eclipse, and graphics were done using Photoshop and PicMonkey.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of the clean, easy-to-read design of our website!  None of our team members have extensive front-end development experience, so creating a functioning website was a big accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JavaDogs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to implement a feature that allows a user to mouse over sections of code and see an explanation pop up, rather than having to read the code's comments.  We would also like to add quizzes and other interactive games to test what the user has learned using JavaDogs.
