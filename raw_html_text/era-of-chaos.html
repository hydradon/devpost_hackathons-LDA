                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a capture the flag game with multiple character.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a multiplayer tank game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it using Unity 3d.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server took to long to set up, and we were fighting with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got multiplayer and a tank to work and move around separately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We must work as a team and not overestimate what we can do. If we were calmer and not blaming each other for doing badly we could've made a better game.
                </p>

                    What's next for Era of Chaos
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to get the multiplayer to work.
