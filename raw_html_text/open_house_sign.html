                    Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication, so I designed an elegant iOS App which takes the &ldquo;Open House&rdquo; address and displays the optimal locations for placing the Signs. The product value is centered around the intelligence in the placement algorithm to help achieve end user goals.

                    My mom is a realtor and I helped her with a couple of open houses. I helped with placing open house signs at strategic places to maximize traffic to the house which increases leads. The problem is, where do you place the open house signs in order to achieve the maximum amount of leads?
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are around 2 million active licensed realtors, each hosting around 24-30 open houses per year on an average across the US resulting in approximately 4-8 leads per home. Well, that is ~500 million potential deals each worth 3-6% commission on average. That is a multi-billion dollar potential impact per year!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I always have been thinking about doing something about it but, the high school workload, volunteering and tennis kept me busy. HSHacks IV was a perfect opportunity and huge motivator for me to pursue my idea.
