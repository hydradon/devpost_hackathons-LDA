                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My group came into this hackathon with eager hearts and empty heads. We all knew that we wanted to learn from making something during this event, but we didn't know what. We went on a brainstorm walk, which led us to walk through the university chemistry lab building. This gave us the inspiration to create a particle-based chemistry simulation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As rudimentary as it is, this simulates an a chemical reaction, which we believe would help benefit lower income schools as well as providing a safe environment to safely mix in chemicals and simulate them. Some examples, include combustion and acid-base reactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split up the tasks and all spent maybe at least 3 hours trying to figure out what to do and how to get things to work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into numerous problems: we had no experience with unity, 3d modeling, working with  a physics engine, coding in the physics, and  no one had any experience with a gaming engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got it to work, all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned, that it was rather difficult to get all the components working together properly. As well as how some components may not even be necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OpenLab
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make further progress in enriching our curious minds for the sake of the future for the children.
