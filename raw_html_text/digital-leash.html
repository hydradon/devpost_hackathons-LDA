                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over&nbsp;10 million dogs&nbsp;and cats are lost or stolen in the U.S. every year. We needed to create a solution that would incorporate GPS tracking along with health vital information in today's day and age.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Functionalities include alerting for location tracking and battery life, health monitoring for temperature
heart rate, and danger detection by audio detection of dog interactions or amplified road noise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used arduino for hardware as well as a prototype app builder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time using hardware in general. There were also missing sensor modules we were not able to incorporate like planned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make the sensors functional and build a product that's vision is for the better of pet lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use the basics of Arduino and that team work makes the dream work. Working under pressure within the time constraints allowed us to push harder than of typical normal routines.
