                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we heard about the travel game challenge, we wanted to make an app that encourages players to go out and explore, but also different from Pokemon Go in some way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game where players have to explore areas of the world they have not explored before to uncover treasures and loot, and survive against hunger, thirst and monsters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Maps Android SDK to display the area around the player. The sdk has extensive capabilities to draw images and shapes onto the map, which let us implement a "fog of war" around the player, and also draw treasures, monsters and other game objects onto the map. The game uses Firebase Database to store game data, and a Java server is used to create game objects and manage other game data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although Google Maps SDK is powerful, it wasn't designed for gaming. We had to try different ways of drawing to get the results that we wanted. Organizing the development process and making sure we're on the same page was also challenging. All of us ran into various problems that slowed us down, but we somehow managed it in the end.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming while being sleepy is not a good idea.
