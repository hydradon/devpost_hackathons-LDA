                    SRS application looking to improve on existing choices by using an improved SM2 algorithm.

                        Spaced Repetition System
                    </strong>
                    is a studying system that takes advantage of the psychological "spacing effect."

                <p>
                    It is _ not _ a recent discovery and applications taking advantage of the convenience of computers _ have _ been made.

                        So why start making a new one?

                    The most popular SRS application not limiting itself to language learning or a specific language in general is Anki.
No, not the Anki that makes sweet lighting cables for your iPhone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anki is an open-source project which happens to be the go to choice for SRS. 
Sadly, Anki has issues in the way it handles lessons.

                    Some days the user gets just
                    <em>
                        too many
                    </em>
                    items (flashcards) to review!
Imagine studying 5 verbs for that Spanish class you are taking and getting bombarded the next day with 20 words!
Where is the balance?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anki is very strict when it comes to studying. Users study everything due at the time of studying and is allowed just that. Only got 4 terms for your Artificial Intelligence Course? Too bad, no more studying for you from that deck of cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ** Enough about anki though, what do we have and what do we hope to accomplish? **

                    We looked towards implementing a better version of the SuperMemo2 algorithm.
We got inspiration from a blog post, it has never been implemented, but we thought it seemed good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don't just give everything due on a given day, we instead opt to give the user the 10 most overdue items.
An item which has been on cool down for 2 months can wait for another 3 days, but that item that had just a 5 day cool down should not be put on hold for too long.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being more flexible with giving items to study and not giving every single item that is due allows us to balance things out and allow users to study terms a bit before they are due and to study more terms if they choose to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would also like to add relations between words. _ Gatito _ and _ gato _ are the same thing, why treat them like different concepts?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We set up the database and some of the functionality. 
We unfortunately do not have a finished demo, but we hope to turn this into a usable open-source project.
Not all of our members were familiar with the libraries being used: an example being javaFx.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope to have something worth talking more about in the future and hopefully it can help people learn new things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was our first hackathon and we focused on learning, having fun, and working on a goal we thought was worthwhile.
