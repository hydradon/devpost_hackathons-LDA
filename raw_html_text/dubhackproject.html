                    Going into dubhacks 2019 our group members had very minimal coding experience outside of our intro to programming classes. We at first had 4 members and ambitious ideas such as creating a mobile app to help international students find popular locations, but we quickly learned that with our skillset we would not be able to accomplish a lot in the amount of time we had. At around 6pm 2 of our group members decided to leave to go home, so Jose and Victor, being the remaining two members decided to not lose hope, and instead try to make this simple little game in Java. Through this experience, we learned that although we might have ambitious dreams, sometimes it's better to work on something small as it allows you to persevere and not give up. While creating this program, we ran into various problems, such as when we had accidentally created an infinite loop while trying to throw an exception. This experience was a fantastic experience as the two of us learned how we can better approach a hackathon.
