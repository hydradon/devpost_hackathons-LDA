                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were young, we had our parents stopping us at the front door if we were underdressed or overdressed for the weather - or sometimes "too inappropriate for school", too - but ever since we got older, we're all on our own.

                    Waking up on time is tough enough but the tougher part is deciding what to wear for the day. 
We can't wear sweatpants and a t-shirt as much as we wanted to, right?
The weather says it's 74 degrees outside but it also says temperature will drop to 42 degrees.... so what do we wear??
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    Alexa can work as your personal stylist and give you outfit suggestions based on the local weather. The outfits are generalized and simple so everyone should be able to get a sense on what type of clothings they should wear each day.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When user provides a city location, API will geo coordinate the city and use the coordinates to get the weather information from the Dark Sky API. Then based on the temperatures and weather conditions, the skill randomly selects an outfit from an array accordingly and suggest outfits to users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time using any external APIs and AWS, and I had to use two different APIs to first geo coordinate a location, and second to get the actual weather conditions. I was all on my own as well, so sometimes things got frustrating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to finish the project all on my own and successfully use the APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that AWS has some great platforms for many developers so that people like me can easily build with and test their skills. It was fun to test the skill right as I was coding it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My Stylist Alexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wish to develop the skill so that it can retrieve the user's current location and use that to get the weather information instead of the user having to provide a city every time. I also hope to expand the array of clothings with more styles added to it, such as casual, semi formal, etc.
