                    Inspired from not so good experiences in physics and chemistry lectures with using the current clicker system, as well as feeling lost as an individual in large lectures.  With the vast majority of students having cell phones, a more active way to participate in class was needed. With Klik, students can answer questions the teacher asks from their cell phones. An algorithm to determine what students were present for the class was also developed, relying on the Bluetooth capability of the phone. The application also retroactively parses through the data stored in SQL and performs smart analytics to determine percentages of questions answered correctly in relation to the other variables of the classroom present.
