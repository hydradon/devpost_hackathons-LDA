                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured that it would be very useful to countries to predict when the diplomats are going to be sent to different countries so that they understand what might come to them and it would also be useful to get analytics based on what types of diplomats are being sent to determine a relationship with a score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using past diplomatic exchange data, we predict the future number of diplomats that will be sent between countries and calculate a score to give data driven insight quickly and accurately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using python for the backend and Machine Learning, and React.js for the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were stuck on getting data from the API and presenting that in a graphical format to the webpage.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should spend more time finishing API integration with the frontend so we can send and receive data in a clean format over just purely having a completed backend.
                </p>

                    What's next for Diplomatic Relations Predictor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to use a pie chart to represent the relationship, and we hope to also use more factors such as trade relations in our score calculations.
