                    This flu season has gained a lot of attention in the media. Headlines are littered with fatalities all over the United States. Interestingly enough, deaths due to the influenza virus are not as uncommon as we may initially believe. In 2014, the CDC stated that the 8th leading cause in mortalities for Americans was the flu. The flu was ranked higher than suicide and hypertension, which are both topics that receive a lot of attention with respect to innovative tech solutions. On average the CDC states that 12,000 to 56,000 people die from the influenza virus annually.

                    Shirley and I have decided to bring more attention to the flu, and how we can all play a role in preventing ourselves and others from getting the virus. While healthy adults are less likely to die from flu related causes, children and older adults are at risk. Preventing the spread of flu by practicing safe habits such as washing your hands before eating and after using the restroom, can go a long way in preventing others and yourself from getting sick.

                    The objective of the game is to play as an office worker who is attempting to earn a promotion. It's flu season, so many of your co-workers are out sick, but some have chosen to come to work to get the promotion. Your goal is to complete the work day along with your daily tasks, which involve going to meetings and sending faxes. While completing these tasks, there are healthy habits you are expected to practice, such as sanitizing your hands after giving many handshakes, and washing your hands after using the bathroom. When you don't practice these healthy habits, your probability of getting sick goes up, and those around you begin to become more ill as well. If you choose to practice these healthy habits throughout the game, you will manage to complete your work day and earn the promotion. If you happen to skip too many of these healthy habits and become sick, your boss will ask you to go home and you will not be eligible for the promotion.

                    By allowing people to go through a working environment during flu season, similar to one that they may encounter on a daily basis, we enable people to see how these habits can be practiced in real life and how neglecting to practice them can result in possibly getting sick. We hope that by educating people on these habits and where they can be applied, we can help prevent the spread of flu.
