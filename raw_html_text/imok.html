                    Inspiration: We realized that current data can easily show critical areas and populations, but there is no application that allows users to alert emergency services of the situation on the Ground. We thought of how Flash Flood warnings are sent out, and realized that HoneyComb works in this domain. We knew we could send out a text message to affected individuals in an affected location.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users in the affected area receive a download link to our application. The application is small to avoid sucking battery and to work in areas with 3g. Users allow location services, and input the number of people they are with and upload data about the situation on the ground. The information is sent to a database on a cloud server, and the information is exported in Geo-JSON objects that can be added as a layer to any application such as geo-q. This will provide emergency services with a live feed of events on the ground to help with response efforts.

                    The application is easy to implement and expand upon, and can be used on a local, national, or international level. It can also be edited to be used in any emergency event.
