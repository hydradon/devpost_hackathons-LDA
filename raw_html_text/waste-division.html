                <p>
                    Massive landfill and waste problem

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Identifies recyclable materials using computer vision
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using OpenCV in Python to contour and crop single objects within an image and using Google Cloud Vision API for identification. As a prototype for testing, we began building An iOS app that uses the built-in camera to detect recyclable materials

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Precise image detection and identifying location of objects
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Classifying recyclables and non-recyclables. Beginning a foundation for a solution.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The gravity of the problem we are dealing with in terms of waste and sanitation. We learned a lot about what computer vision is capable of and how it can be applied when improvements in accuracy

                    What's next for
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waste Division Segregating and identifying recyclables in a larger space such as a landfill. Future features which would make the application practical and usable in a real-world context such as linking robotics to clean up landfills.
