                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a platform to help immigrants connect with each other and find communities to join.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects users trying to adapt to a new life in the United States.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Firebase for the back end and angular for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried using the Mac localhost on Windows.
We accidentally called the google translate API 600,000 times with a cloud function and couldn't kill it.
I entered the stadium on the opposite side and couldn't find my team because the orientation was reversed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had almost no experience with any of these languages before we started, so we're happy anything worked at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    javascript, firebase, and angular.js
                </p>
