                    With medicine being such large market place there are simply not enough applications and services out there. We realized through even our own personal experience that medical institutions are not very efficient. Some patients will be there without any justification, this wastes everybody's time and stops other patients with more severe cases from getting the help they need. Eventually going to the hospital becomes a painful task causing people to skip their regular checkups, or even worse, thinking their situation is alright and avoiding doctors when they truly need the aid.
