                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too many engineering classes have problem sets scattered across various midterms, homeworks, discussion notes, etc. We made ribbit to bring all of these problems to one place, organized to let students understand their strengths and weaknesses on individual problems or across higher-level topics in the class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ribbit is a web service that extracts problems from documents uploaded by class instructors, and allows students to (1) filter these problems by topic and (2) track their understanding by rating the problems based on perceived difficulty.
With ribbit, students can easily identify topics they don't understand and filter all of the problems from the class by that particular topic, helping them make connections by seeing many examples of that one topic in succession.
Additionally, ribbit provides the student data to instructors, letting them see how the class is performing both on particular problems and across higher-level topics, which can help them direct their teaching to where students need it most.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built ribbit with a node.js server, mongodb database, and an html/javascript/css frontend.
We also used Textract from amazon web services to extract the problems from images uploaded by the instructor.
Client/server interaction was employed with ajax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ribbit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One future direction for ribbit is generating a "coverage report" for students so they can easily view their strengths and weaknesses in a class. Also we see ribbit aggregating student performance data across many versions of the same class in different schools, which would help instructors understand trends in student learning on particular topics.
