                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it easy to remember names of people you meet, even if you forget their name ten seconds after you meet them, and be able to catalog other important information about them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to manually record audio of the person you are talking with and gives you back the name of that person using voiceprints. If it finds a name the user will receive a text message containing their name. Essentially, the app will act as a more personalized contact book.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using XCode and AWS to record audio and send the file to the cloud for the other program to retrieve, analyze, and send out the name/s vis SMS. The program we wrote to analyze the audio file constructs a mapping of names to voiceprints so later when you start talking again you will receive a text with their name if it wasn't mentioned in the conversation already.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried using a bunch of different cloud services and picking the easiest one to use was very time-consuming. Also designing how we wanted to build the hack was complicated because we wanted to use multiple services and connecting them all together was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were persistent in getting a "finished" hack even if we had to continuously pivot our ideas to make it feasible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java, AWS, how cloud computing services rank up against each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hey U?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to move the functionality to a small wristband with buttons to record and send data to the cloud for processing. Add security. Add personalization to your account. Optimize speech recognition. FitBit application?
Add option to transcribe and store conversations on the app.
