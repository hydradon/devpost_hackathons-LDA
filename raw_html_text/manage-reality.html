                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Health and wellness make up integral parts of our lives. It is important to not only focus on physical health, but also be mindful of mental health as well. Manage Reality focuses on anxiety disorder. Most people don't know that an estimated 31.1% of U.S. adults experience any anxiety disorder at some time in their lives. Our goal is to spread more awareness and provide a resource for those who may be suffering or those whose loved ones may be suffering from anxiety.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Manage Reality acts as an interactive medium for understanding more about anxiety disorder and also provides resources for both immediate and long-term care.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By leveraging WebVR, we built an immersive experience for the user. We used Node.js along with Kraken as our server-side technologies to deploy with Google App Engine. We used JavaScript, HTML, and A-Frame for our front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first challenge was overcoming the fact that none of us have a particularly strong opinion on what project to work on. This led us to spend a lengthy time brainstorming and coming up with a solid idea that we all believed in. And of course, we also faced the challenges associated with working with new and unfamiliar technologies.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re extremely proud of our team for working across extremely varied backgrounds (2 hackathon newbies) and with new technology (VR and d3.js). Also the fact that we were so adaptable as a team and supported each other in our ideas throughout the brainstorming process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the d3.js library to bind data to arbitrary shapes and DOM elements that can then be used to make really interesting visualizations and animations. We also learned about the immersive power of Virtual Reality and the potential of this popular gaming technology for health and wellness. We also learned that even complete strangers can work together to accomplish a common goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Manage Reality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project has a lot of potential for growth!
Because Manage Reality is a visual application, a next step would be to include data visualizations to further illustrate the prevalence of anxiety and the demographics of those who have it. We could also add more individualized resources such as dynamically querying therapists in the local area.
