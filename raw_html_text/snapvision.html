                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My intention is to remove some of the linguistic barriers between communities and individuals.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This applications allows the user to take pictures of signs, flyers, and written text and translate the text into a message in their native language

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used android studio and the google vision and translation APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very much a newbie when it comes to using the GCP, so it found it quite challenging to make use of the Google APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was happy I managed to finished this project by myself! I'm used to working with people during hackathons but this time I wanted to go solo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a ton about the GCP
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SnapVision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to improve the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms and extend the number of available languages it can translate.
