                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To continue encouraging MCFB donors to keep supporting local food banks.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Windows application automates the process of generating and sending thank you emails to all the generous donors. As a result, it helps reduce the number of employee hours spent doing repetitive paperwork and ensure that emails get delivered on time.

                    Problem Statement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Our non-profit has 2 full-time employees, 5 part time employees. It takes about 60-70 volunteers a week to keep us a float. The less paper work we do, the more time for our clients we will have."

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a C# Windows form application using .NET framework class libraries. Using the generated .csv file consisting of all the donors information, we parsed the relevant data and procedurally generated an appreciation email consisting of HTML body which is then sent to the donors. In addition, a file is created of each donor who don't have their emails specified. Furthermore, a data visualization feature was added to provide more insight about the days of the donations.
