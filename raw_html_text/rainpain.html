                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 2017, Houston went through a tragedy. Something we never want to go through again
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        But understand what happened and what actions we can take to mitigate future issues is challenging
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                We live in a world of tons of data and information, but sometimes it&rsquo;s too overwhelming
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Even if you were to find the correct data sets, you&rsquo;d still need to connect it to other data sets &mdash; and even more data sets, to help make more sense of everything
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        But what if there was one centralized hub where any interested Houstonians could come together, share their findings, and aggregate their analyses to better inform policy makers in the city?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Now there is
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Introducing RainPain, Houston&rsquo;s one-stop solution for understanding how Houston&rsquo;s rain and flooding issues are impacting the city.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In a little more than a day, our team of data scientists and developers have mapped together Houston rain sets to understand rainfall throughout the city:
