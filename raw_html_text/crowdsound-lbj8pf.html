                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the problem of hosts of social gatherings to provide music that pleases the majority of their guests. 
As a host, one can only guess what music their guests would enjoy listening to, but with our app, the people themselves get to decide the songs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app takes in suggestions of songs and stores them in a list which all clients can access and up-vote songs. Then the next song played is the one with the most votes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hosted our app using node.js and stored the information of the songs on Firebase. We used the SongCloud API to search for and play songs and used the Firebase API to push and retrieve the song data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges using node.js as none of us had used it previously. We also had difficulty putting the different parts of our project together, namely the SoundCloud and Firebase parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create an almost functioning app as the work we had left was to put our parts together. We were also proud to have even created a project in such a short time as, being freshmen, we have not been to many hackathons before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to communicate together to discuss ideas and create a plan and schedule which we checked up on with each other. We also definitely learned to scour the APIs and to take advantage of the resources provided to us so as to further our project.
                </p>

                    What's next for CrowdSound
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to finish putting our parts together, namely the Firebase component, so we can have a fully functioning app!
