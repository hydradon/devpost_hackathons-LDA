                    AirSafe notifies you of the air quality in a building, the sensors would be hooked up to an alarming system so that when air quality becomes poor or unsafe, air vents would automatically open to let in clean, filtered air.

                    Typical offices have 700-1200 ppm, but if the number goes too high, productivity and comfort will fall drastically. 
There are several things that influence air quality, but three things are generally measured: Temperature, air moist and CO2 level. With these three numbers known, you are very close to knowing if the air is ok.
