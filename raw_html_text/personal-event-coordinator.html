                <p>
                    Traveling should always be fun but it can often be frustrating to plan out, especially with others. Planning a trip with your family, coworkers, or simply others going to the same event should be as simple as buying a tall pumpkin spice latte. Personal Event Coordinator was designed to take the logistics out of trip planning to have you focused on enjoying the trip by coordinating around special events such as family reunions, professional conferences, and comic cons.
