                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    With the constant evolution of the internet and web technologies, web developers are spread thinner than ever. Accessibility is often overlooked. We wanted to make a tool which would provide an accessibility layer on top of webpages -- providing users with accessibility automatically without developers having to spend painstaking hours on such a thing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is a Google Chrome Extension which provides an accessibility layer on top of web pages in two important ways
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Automatically generate and add alt tags to images without them
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Automatically make texts contrast with their backgrounds with a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is a Google Chrome Extension with a server-less architecture. We utilized AWS's API Gateway to communicate with our AWS Lambda computational unit. The Lambda function is responsible for generating the alt text for the image. This utilizes Azure's Computer Vision API to do so. Although computationally expensive, our software is
                    <strong>
                        heavily optimized
                    </strong>
                    and implements a 2-layer cache system, with the 1st layer as warm Lambda storage and the 2nd layer as AWS DynamoDB. In this way, once a page's alt texts have been generated and cached once, any users of the page will effectively instantly have access to them. Very little data is passed between the client &amp; API Gateway (only a URL and a dictionary of alt texts), meaning that alt texts will (generally) be available before the images actually load. Thus, it also benefits people with limited internet access. Lastly, the automatic text contrasting is done in the frontend by "hacking" the mathematics of RGB coloring.

                <p>
                    We also built a static site

                        hosted by Amazon S3
                    </a>
                    for testing purposes.

                <p>
                    Web accessibility is an enormously difficult problem. There is a reason a tool like this doesn't exist already. The standards aren't clear cut from a programmatic perspective, making automated testing difficult. Specifically, automatically

                    the issues is a huge undertaking. Thankfully, with the help of our Microsoft Mentor -- Morgan, we discovered

                    . We used this to test our extension's components to ensure they were working correctly.
