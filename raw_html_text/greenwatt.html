                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that not many buildings in UC Davis are not LEED certified. We wanted to see what is the energy usage difference between a LEED-certified building to a non-LEED certified building. So we can give recommendations on how to improve based on the information we get.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website compares a LEED-certified building to non-LEED certified building. and gives recommendations on how to reduce the energy usage for the non-LEED certified building.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to build the website. We get the data we need from OSIsoft PI Web API to show the chart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we were not familiar with creating a website, we were not able to put in all the features we wanted to put in. For example, we wanted to get data from the PI API directly on our website for statistics, however, we did not have enough time to do it. Before the deadline, we were able to show only one comparison by mandatorily putting the data values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of that we tried to use the data to improve the UC Davis community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to parse through a rest API and integrate that data with visualization tools. As well as interpret the data and implement solutions based on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GreenLight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more buildings to compare and find an efficient way to grab the data from the API to use in our website.
