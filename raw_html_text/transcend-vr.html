                    is a multimedia, virtual reality adventure game. You wake up, locked in a jail cell, and your captors are unsure what to do with you. It's your job to escape!

                    The story behind
                    <em>
                        Transcend VR
                    </em>
                    started out in the form of a college student's fantasy novel, then moved onto a screenplay that four would-be game developers thought would work well in a VR setting. The game necessitated hiring voice actors, recording sound effects, animating motion-capture references, and composing our very own soundtrack, all of which we were able to incorporate for the Oculus Touch. Although no one on the project is a programmer by major, we all loved working in a hackathon setting and learning together.

                    This project has been a true adventure for all those involved. As game developers, we hope to take this game to the next level - literally! We'd like to thank the following for all their assistance in making this adventure come to life:
