                    "The average appointment wait time is a staggering 72 days", according to a recent survey. While most of the time, people cannot wait this long. We hope to find a way to provide some instant medical services when a doctor is not available. Many health conditions can be checked by video chat, especially when you show your symptoms vividly and directly to a doctor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another important fact is when people feel some uncomfortable, they tend to ignore it because seeing a doctor requires waiting too long. This is how people miss the early signs of cancer. If an instant medical consulting is available, they can get very valuable suggestions from a general doctor, even a practitioner, and make a right choice about whether meeting a real doctor is necessary.

                    I am taking real analysis this semester, and my professor just had several severe heart problems last week and have been in the hospital for a week. He described to us "It was very hard for me to just walk around, but I thought it was nothing serious, and it was a Friday, I didn't manage to talk to my doctor, so I just sit and wait". But actually, he was sent to ER and he was in an extremely dangerous condition. If he could get instant professional consulting from a doctor, he wouldn't wait until became unconscious.

                        Apple Health contains many biometrics info such as weight, height, heart rate, sleep analysis, nutrition data which are useful for doctors.  We wish to generate a patient record history based on this so a patient can share it directly with the doctor.
