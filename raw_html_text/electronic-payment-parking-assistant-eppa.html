                    Ticket machines require that you predict how long you will be staying in a car park for which can potentially be difficult and may lead to overpaying (bought 4 hours, only used 2) and fines (bought 2 hours, used 4).

                    EPPA makes use of iBeacons to register when you arrive at and leave a parking lot.
It then calculates the amount of time you spent at the car-park, compares it to the rates and automatically charges you the correct amount as you leave.

                    The payment is made through use of the Braintree API.
The user connects their PayPal account to the system which then makes use of PayPal's one-click payment, allowing them to come and go with ease.
