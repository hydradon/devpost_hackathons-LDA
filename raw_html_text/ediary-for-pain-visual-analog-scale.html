                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I work for a company that translates the medical questionnaires used in clinical trials.  I've been learning about Unicode lately and thought it would be fun to create a Visual Analog Scale (also called a VAS) using emojis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just C++ and VIM.  I just finished 161 so that's the extent of my skills.  :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Check out those emojis!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Speaking of emojis, I had planned to make them much larger but wasn't able to figure out how to do that in the console.  If anyone knows how to do that, please let me know!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to display Unicode characters in C++, how to validate that input is actually an integer,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for the project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a real eDiary, the patient would be able to save data throughout the day instead of entering all data at the end of the day.  Time to learn about databases!
