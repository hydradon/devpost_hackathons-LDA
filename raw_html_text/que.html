                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication is as important as breathing in today's scenario. Well, breathing helps you to survive but communication will help others to survive. The most effective intangible weapons are WORDS and how you use those weapons are in the form of COMMUNICATION.  But, due to amazing diversity of language, also comes a language gap. The largest gap is likely to occur in instances where someone from a Northern City, goes to speak to someone in a Southern village, or vice versa. The gap is largely regional many people face problem in understanding language all across globe.  So, from developer point of view language gap can cause vital problems during development which can be solved by using our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project "Que" incorporates developers to post questions in their local languages and any user from any part of the world can view those questions and answers in their comfortable languages. The project Que  is made to overcome the language gap between the developers all across the globe. The application language library supports almost all type of major languages as required by the developer/user. If a developer wants to answer other developer&rsquo;s questions he/she can easy login the application with Facebook or Account kit and answer it, vice versa.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Java: Succeeded in making the back end completely.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spring: Framework that helps us to "wire" different components together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        HTML5: Used for describing the contents and appearance of Web pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        CSS3: Used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a mark-up language.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bootstrap4: Framework Used to power the front end.

                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating different systems and technologies. There are thousands of different technologies, systems and applications available for businesses. Integrating third-party or other custom applications, such as our CRM, website, or an inventory management database, added to the complexity of our project as the new software solution must conform to the external constraints of these existing systems. Even a simple requirement, such as supporting multiple browsers, significantly increases the complexity of building and testing software solutions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This product has the potential to be a fully grown startup! This is our second hackathon project, and we've put in a lot of effort trying to create something that would not only be useful for me, but also many other developers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Complexity does not equal a lot of code. Creating such project with many different parts working together did not mean that we needed a tremendous amount of code. Although we had to write a lot of code for the Java interface, the algorithm for language translation, we were able to make them communicate well with the help of google translator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Que - क्यूं ?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to take this project to some beta users, and we'll see where it goes from there!
