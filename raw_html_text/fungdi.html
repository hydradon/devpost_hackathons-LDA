                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WE LOVE MUSHROOMS!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using a camera on your phone you can see how deadly and what genus/species of mushroom you have picked. This is important because of the many amateur foragers out there, especially in Santa Cruz.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used google's cloud to train a model and do image prediction. This in conjunction with an iOS app as a client.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trainning a model is easy to say but hard to do.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we should all love each other and be happy with the life we are given in this pre-apocalyptic era run by the Trumpacabra.

                    Use the rest of out google cloud money trainning the models.
