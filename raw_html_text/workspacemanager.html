                <p>
                    WorkspaceManager isn't flashy. It's practical. This app seamlessly integrates itself into your workflow, allowing you to open collections of applications all at once rather than one at a time. WorkspaceManager isn't something you'll notice is there -- but it's something you'll notice is gone.

                <h2>
                    Technical Difficulty
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most difficult part of building WorkspaceManager is that it interacts with other applications. Using python, we were able to take advantage of command line tools in a new way.

                <h2>
                    User Experience
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WorkspaceManager is a simple drop-down menu on the top right of your screen. It's there when you need it, and you won't notice it when you don't. A natural addition to any college students set of tools.
