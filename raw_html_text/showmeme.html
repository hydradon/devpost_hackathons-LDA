                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are hundreds of programs that use image recognition and computer vision (CV) to classify images to concepts. What if we went the other way? I wanted to build a program that created images based on descriptions of a scene. Imagine Google Images, but for images that don't exist.

                    <li>
                        You input a sentence
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My algorithm loops through, creating entities based by part-of-speech tagging (nouns, verbs, adjectives)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Images are downloaded for each entity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Images are transformed based on their relation to each other

                        Your creation comes to life

                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created two classes for the entity recognition, or "chunking" algorithm:
Entities (Nouns/Things):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Contain an image with a picture of the object
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can be combined to make a new entity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        * Several images can be combined using a custom merging algorithm I wrote:
                        <code>
                            python
#merges sequential entities using a generic combining transformation
def mergestreak(subrange):
subrange_length = next_power_of_2(len(subrange))
while (len(subrange) &lt; subrange_length):
subrange.append(blankimg)
print("adding a blank image!")
print("Subrange Length:" + str(subrange_length))
while (len(subrange) &gt; 1):
for i in range(0, len(subrange), 2):
print(i)
subrange[i] = combine(subrange[i], subrange[i + 1])
showimg(subrange[i].image)
del subrange[1::2]
return subrange[0]
                        </code>
                        Links (Prepositions/Relationships between two Entities):
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prepositions such as "on", "at", and "by" describe how two Entities relate to each other in the picture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using a dispatching function pattern, I assigned a function to each preposition that combines two Entities in a special way.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Verbs and articles are ignored. Adjectives are noted, but not implemented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Images are more challenging than I initially thought. Managing the alpha channel and other image aspects provided a learning curve.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a custom morphing algorithm was something I didn't get to.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I wish I had thought of using CoLab IPython notebooks earlier as a way to host the program.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Although Python is still my favorite language, I discovered the drawbacks to dynamically typed languages this weekend. When you're trying to hack something together, it's easy to send the wrong data type to your own function.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        Entity recognition and Entity merging provided two challenging problems. Managing a changing list of entities tested my array manipulation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created something new.

                        Be careful when designing abstract programs - you'll have to rewrite almost everything.
