                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through other hackathons, I've thought of using AI to efficiently scheduling massive computing jobs for cloud computing services. Figured it would be nice to start simple with an easy scheduling Java application!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will take the times you are available to work and a list of jobs to complete, and it will generate a schedule optimized for minimal lateness. Based off your real time completions for assignments, it better predicts how long later assignments will take!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using standard greedy algorithms for the scheduling and java.swing for the graphics, we had all resources available to fully develop this java app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the front end user interface with the back end scheduling. This required a lot of effort to get communication going.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mix of experience has allowed for great teamwork and has made this project considerably enjoyable to work on!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        A LOT
                    </strong>
                    of Java graphics.

                    What's next for Cuckoo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make it more intelligent with scheduling, allowing for different scheduling options ranging from minimal lateness to weighted importance of assignments. There is also more to expand on the user interface and provide analytics for rates of completion.
