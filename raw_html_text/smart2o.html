                    Inspiration and What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As part of our Environmental Science class at our high school, our teacher has taught us the importance of water conservation done by ordinary people, like you and me. Acting on this source of inspiration, we decided to create a website application that addresses these concerns, and allows utility companies to directly inspire water conservation in hundreds of households in a geographical area, such as Dallas. To accomplish this task, we decided the best way to inspire people to conserve water was to encourage a little bit of friendly competition, which we did by ranking users based on the number of gallons of water that they conserved.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website was built mainly using Javascript, Vue.js, and D3.js. We used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to build the basics/foundation of our website, while Vue.js was used to connect the frontend and the backend of our project. Lastly, we used D3.js to visualize collected data as graphs and other interesting visuals.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge that we ran into when developing this project was thinking of the best way to encourage water conservation among users: was friendly competition or collaboration better? In the end, we chose competition over collaboration, but in the future we would like to experiment in methods that implement both social frameworks. The biggest technical challenge that we ran into was using Vue.js, because during the course of the hackathon we had to both learn and implement this javascript framework, which was entirely new to us.

                <p>
                    We plan on reaching out to Utility companies to determine the feasibility of our project in actual production, and possibly turn our website from a Proof of Concept to an application in production.
