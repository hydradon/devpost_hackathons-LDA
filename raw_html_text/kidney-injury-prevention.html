                </h2>
                <p>
                    Acute kidney injury costs the US healthcare system $10 Billion a year. Up to 30% of cardiac surgery patients acquire acute kidney injury (AKI). Developing even the most mild form of AKI increases mortality risk by 2.2 times. The gold standard biomarker for AKI is serum creatinine rise, which occurs 24-48 hours after surgery.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The PHD (Pee, High Definition) system looks at kidney metrics to help detect the onset of kidney injury during the operation in order to prevent progression to AKI and dialysis.
