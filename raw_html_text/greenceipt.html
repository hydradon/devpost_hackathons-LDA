                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Raymond, one of our team members, spends hundreds of hours working as a cashier and experiences first-hand the countless rolls of receipt paper used on a regular basis. And we&rsquo;ve all been on the other side of the counter -- given receipts that could rival the winning cup-stack in height, only to become crumpled and lost in our wallet abyss. With so much focus on reusable bagging at checkouts- we&rsquo;ve happened to forget the greatest culprit. Receipts account for 1.5 billions pounds of waste per year in the US, including 1 billion gallons of water, 10 million trees, and 250 million gallons of oil, only to be forgotten about or thrown away.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Greenceipts achieves two primary goals- eliminate the waste generated from receipts and eliminate the hassle of physical receipts. A consumer can easily sync their receipt to their &lsquo;wallet&rsquo;, where all of their receipts can be stored and organized. It also saves consumers from stressing out when receipts can&rsquo;t be found in the case of making returns.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Received uses an RFID reader and Arduino. The code for the user app was written in Python and also utilizes the Walmart API. We also have a prototype of the app viewable on Figma.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group with a lot of first-time hackers, we were met with some time management challenges (sometimes, you can&rsquo;t go pet the puppies, toast s&rsquo;mores, and get boba). We ended up striking a balance between a project we&rsquo;re proud of and enjoying all of the fun events PennApps has to offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re really proud to be able to introduce an app that is both practical and engaging to use, but socially- minded as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use different aspects of UI/UX design such as creating user personas to create products tailored to our audience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Greenceipts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to expand Greenceipts to tracking spending over time and offering visualization of that data, such as line graphs and grouping money spent into departments like produce, home office, etc., to help consumers see where they&rsquo;re spending most of their money and help them save money.
