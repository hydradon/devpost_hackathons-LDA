                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of this idea wanting to do something along the lines of computer vision and machine learning. Additionally, we saw the kitchen as a great place for us to demonstrate the disturbance that needs to be caused by tech.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chop changes the way you make recipes and plan for the future Because the board can keep track of what you eat and how healthy it is, it makes it easy to plan for other exciting meals, but stay healthy at the same time.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Opencv to detect a number of foods and also created an iOS application with a camera mounted, that would allow for the vision to happen. We also have raspberry pi on the board that allows us to make weight measurements and blink leds.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was with the flask web framework. We had some issues with making request among three machines, and therefore were slowed down a little.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the teamwork that we exhibited, especially being a team that didn't know each other until the hackathon. We plan to stay in touch!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that hard work pays off, but we also wish that we managed our time a little better. This was a very exciting experience, and being among the smartest people in the nation was a learning experience in itself.
