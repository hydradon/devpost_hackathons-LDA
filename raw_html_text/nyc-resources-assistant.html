                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    20% of U.S. youth have a special health care need and they would not involve parents or family physicians for some concerns like substance use, sexual health and emotional problems. The barriers to help-seeking includes concerns about confidentiality, little knowledge of service, discomfort with disclosing health concerns, poor accessibility and financial barriers. These problems bothers foster children even more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to provide youth with information and access to free or low cost healthcare resources for their specific need like mental illness, medical needs including sex and reproductive health.
