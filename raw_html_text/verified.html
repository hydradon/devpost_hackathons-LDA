                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    The 2016 presidential election and the effect that it had on the news.  The MACRON hacking scandal in the past French election

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Prompts for a url and then determines whether the text at the URL is fake or real

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Passive Aggressive classifier in Python from the sklearn library that was trained on a dataset of fake and real news:

                    </a>
                    We used this tutorial:

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problem:
Initially ran into issues with implementing the Python libraries in the app, learned that we could not use complex Python machine learning libraries in the Google app engine
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proposed Solution:
Switched to Heroku instead
                </p>
                <p>
                    Issues: lack of familiarity with web applications, our person who did did not appear for our submission
                </p>
                <p>
                    Final Solution:
Making a text-based script
                </p>

                <p>
                    We worked with all different types of people, including people who did not have computer science and everyone got to have a significant contribution and work together as a team
