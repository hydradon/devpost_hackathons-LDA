                    Inspiration - The form of education that is the most mainstream has many shortcomings.  We wanted to help alleviate some of these shortcomings by creating a very interactive classroom in virtual space that can be used by educational institutions.  Specifically we allow students to interact with objects related to the subject as a way to make concepts more concrete.

                <h2>
                    What it does - Our project allows students to interact with objects in virtual space.  We will reiterate it again will make abstract objects more concrete.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - We utilized skills that we acquired throughout our educational careers and implemented through Unity.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - We .  Specifically we had difficulty building 3D models, user interaction within virtual space through the use of hand gestures, and the timing of objects as it transversed through space.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - We enhanced our educational experience through working on this project.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - We learned to better interact with a widely used game engine, Unity.  Specially we learned to implement different API's and used them effectively.

                    What's next for Immersive Lecture - Our final vision is a library that is a virtual representation of the nexus of human ingenuity and experience.  This allows each book the representation of a very specific piece of knowledge or experience.
