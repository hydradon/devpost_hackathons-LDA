                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We heard that a patient in Canada passed away because there was not enough staff to handle multiple cases. Sadly, none of the nurses were notified that the vitals of another patient were deteriorating. This could have been prevented if there was an existing device that could have helped notified the staff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The IoT Health Portal allows the patient to be monitored 24h/7. All information is being communicated in real time to the nurses&rsquo; work station. In case of any abnormalities, the nurse is provided with patient ID and room # to physically go check the patient&rsquo;s vitals. 
With that technology, incoming patients can also be monitored while waiting to be seen by a physician.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Health monitor(created using NBIoT) provided by Twilio , a temperature sensor, a narrowband device and a computer with internet accessibility  .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the devices as well as using the wrong sensors were very challenging. We are more proficient in using Arduino based code for programing IoT devices, learning how to program on a new board was definitely along a learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud for not giving up after all of the challenges we ran into. We had an amazing time with the Twilio and T-mobile team who were all very friendly and resourceful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All technologies used were new to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for IoT Health Portal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After having analyzed how much of an impact this device can make towards improving health care, we would definitely keep on exploring more on the idea.
