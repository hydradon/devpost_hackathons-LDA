                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to jump into the world of robotics!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walks!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an Arduino, tounge compressors, and lots of hot glue
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult programming the walking motion and balancing the robot.  Also, one of our servos broke after the project was assembled
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mimicking a waddling motion and getting our robot to move!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When making a robot, there are many things that can go wrong.
