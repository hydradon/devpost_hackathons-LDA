                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was mainly to get familiar with making video-games in Unity. We wanted to experience Hackathon and have fun while doing so. We decided to come up with an idea that is light hearten and bring us the most learning experience within the time that we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a small game for people to enjoy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and C# to code and design the entire game while learning from Youtube and google whenever we ran into a problem. The graphics we created in Gimp 2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were going to work with VR and the Oculus rift at first but because of time and hardware issue we were unable to work with it and decided to change our approach. We changed our initial idea from a VR game to a regular game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dusty C.: I am proud of what I have learn here in the short amount of time and gain a valuable first experience.
Angela R.: For this game to be the first game either of us have ever created on Unity, I am proud of what we have made even while it certainly can be improved upon in several aspects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with a popular gaming develop software called Unity and C# and tips/advice from other hacker for our education, career, and our next hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Potato Pug
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step would be to create a better version or upgrade of this game. However, creating this game was merely a learning experience for both of us and with the experience we gained, we hope to have made a better understanding on the game making process.
