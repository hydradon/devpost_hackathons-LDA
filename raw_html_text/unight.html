                    </strong>
                    fans who cheer for the same artist at a stadium concert? Adrenaline that comes from such experience is difficult to forget. With
                    <strong>

                    , you can easily recreate the experience, with your cell phone alone.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Current centralized cheering activity requires a specific artist-designated light stick, programmed for a specific event by a single administrator.  Unight allows any moderator to upload a slogan photo, and automatically distributes the image to the crowd's cellphones so that each member of the crowd becomes part of the larger image.
