                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to simplify everyday healthcare. It's often difficult for doctors to give an accurate medical diagnosis without crucial details such as the frequency, severity and location of effects on the body. With Mediprep, customers can easily track their symptoms, medications, and, overall status using Echo Plus, an affordable, out of the box home automation tool that is there when you need her. With the collected information, complex computations can be run and share strictly within your inner health care circle in order to ensure that you are informed, healthy, and aware of your condition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using AI technology, users can log their medical conditions by saying &ldquo;Alexa, tell MediPrep I feel a (insert sensation) in my (insert body part) with a severity of (level of intensity). When it&rsquo;s time to go to the Doctor, users can bring their secure data with them. Our Web Application easily allows users to access information logged from Alexa and also be able to log their diagnosis/ medicines prescribed after the doctor appointment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript and React on the front-end. Django and Python for REST API and PostgresSQL for the backend. NodeJs and the AlexaSDK allowed us to interface with the echo device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping up with the quickly changing API that is AlexaSDK proved to be challenging due to the lack of documentation and community discussion about new or newly changed features.
