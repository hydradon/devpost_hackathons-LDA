                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to let people know that everyone can make a change in the environment! 
Inspired by Shanghai's environmentally friendly frenzy, we decided that we could also make a change!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's not that hard to trash an item into the correct category. The problem is: How could we inspire users to develop a habit of disposing of the trash into the correct category.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity works Miracles! We used the Unity engine to develop this simple game to provide background knowledge on the types of garbage and how to dispose of them.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were some collaboration issues and time constraint issues that we ran into. We also did some hardcore debugging to ensure that it worked nicely and smoothly.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we were proud of mustering the courage and determination to enter the hackathon. But after we got in, we thought differently. Hmmm, it sounds like an accomplishment leaving a positive impact (no matter how slight) on the world!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned game development and time management skill. Last and not least, hacking is fun!
