                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ** We interviewed middle and high schoolers to talk about their daily lives. Many of them described it as hard, stressful, overwhelming, etc. We have all experienced this before, and our team strongly wanted to create an app where we can support students to be less stressed.**

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ** It makes a personalized schedule for you that balances out each day from how you feel, activities, and many more, and creates time management. Also, it not only focus on our priorities in our schedule, but also about our body and health.**

                    How I built it

                    We built it through xCode.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were first hackers and had no idea on what computer programming was, so we deifinitely faced some challenges through word terms and coding.
