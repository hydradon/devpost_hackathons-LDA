                    One of my friends had an idea for this but we never made much progress on it. I wanted to work on it and get something going for later in the summer to finished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's the idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Voting fraud is a concern for both major political parties. Furthermore, voter participation is the lowest it has been in generations. Voting ID laws and the process of voting is not convenient for regular citizens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using blockchain technologies I plan to create a unique id, similar to a social security number, for voting to be used.
                </p>

            <div class="" id="built-with">
                <h2>

                <ul class="no-bullet inline-list">
                    <li>
                        <span class="cp-tag">

                        </span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
