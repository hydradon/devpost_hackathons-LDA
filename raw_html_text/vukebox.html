                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For example on house parties somebody connects his phone to the local hifi system. But most of the other party visitors don't like the playing playlist. And because of this reason we'd like to design a system to make a fair playlist for everybody.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides the visitors an interface to vote and add songs to the playlist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using GitLab for group development and an dev aws server.
The backend is running on node.js with an connection to an mongodb server.
The frontend is written in Angular
                </p>
