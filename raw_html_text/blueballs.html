                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We lost a lot of golf balls when we were young. We would also lose track of our scorecards. For one of us, losing the scorecard meant not being able to prove that he beat his opponent at golf. This was unacceptable. That's why we made BlueBalls. Using the laser precision technology of Blue Beans combined with our immense knowledge of golf balls, we created the ultimate in golf scorecard recognition technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeps track of your scorecard, and gives you a nice bunch of statistics about your shot.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team consists of pro-am golf players with a cumulative 20 year experience playing golf. We used an Arduino board with Bean bluetooth peripheral devices integrated in the golf balls and the holes to track a player's progress on the field.
