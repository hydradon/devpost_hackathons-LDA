                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to how much controversy there is in the world, we thought it would be cool if people had the opportunity to compare different sides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We offer a platform for anonymous debate to allow people to have a chance to fully express themselves. It is also a good way to prevent oneself from becoming close-minded, as you will see things from beyond just your own perspective and will be forced to really understand your own convictions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the platform on top of a service that handles sockets so we can send instant messages within a chat room. We also created data wrapped around the messages to allow for voting to have some quantitative way of showing which side seemed to debate better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each of our teammates had totally different expertise that they brought to the table, this posed a challenge for us when trying to figure out how to tie our abilities together. We also had a hard time choosing the right platform to build from. Two of our teammates left early and progress wasn't really made until 12 hours before the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was fun playing with new technologies and things that we aren't comfortable with. Getting a chance to actually set up messaging functionality was pretty cool!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about teamwork, planning, and choosing the right frameworks/technologies for the job. In the future, projects will hopefully go smoother.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Open Mind Debate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be nice to add more functionality such as individual debater rankings, score breakdowns, and top messages sent to it. A nice UI would also be pretty nice!
