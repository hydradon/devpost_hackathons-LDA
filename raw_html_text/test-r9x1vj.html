                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We' re wasting a lot of time on daily basis just by waiting for a public transport. We wanted to turn that time into something useful. Why not help others while waiting for a bus..sound good?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using touch screen at bus stop it let's idle people (who are waiting for bus) put that time into filling out survey to donate money to charity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used: HTML CSS Typeform inscape and MS AZURE. Using Bus stop touchscreen we place product survey into HTML script. When survey is being filled out, user uses button at bottom, that sends info to database. Visual structure was being tweaked by Inkscape.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For us the biggest challenge was to explain the idea how one can donate money that they dont own just by pressing buttons while waiting for bus. Ofcourse there' s alot more to that than user might think (precise audience targeting by companies that are paying for surveys, helping others by donations,  using spare time to something useful, development of bus station as it self, development of data analasys and marketing ways, provocating people to look socially good, development of JCD business).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Development of the idea this kind. Its not a win-win. Its a win-win-win all over... We're proud that with marketing tool like this it motivates companies not to just put money into marketing but put it in a way that promotes company AND donates to charity at same time. Why would you do it any other way than this?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about technologies that can be implemented in bus stops and operating systems, that are being used to power advertising screens. Research about paid surveys also showed that they are quite valuable for companies and the overall amount of money donated over time might be quite meaningful. This challenge also gave us new insights into coding and designing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Business viability
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The money, of course, comes from companies that want to conduct any kind of targeted research. The possibilities are limitless, because surveys can be placed in distinguished areas (near a bar, sports center, university etc.). After receiving the needed quantity of responses, a fixed amount of money can be sent to charity and also to the owner of bus stop ad space.  This kind of advertising would be superior to usual online surveys because of the  placement, surveys would be filled much quicker, respondent would be socially driven to help therefore would answer honestly and would be tempted to use time he has to wait for public transport.
