                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using the PHP programming language using the Code Igniter Framework and using the MySQL database as a data storage media. The data that we need for this application is the location (latitude and longitude) of tourism or UMKM as well as a description of the place, to be displayed on the website and using google maps technology as a medium to show and provide directions for the tour, by taking the last location user (latitude and longitude).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        There is a need for activeness from UMKM to keep updating the product so that the content is always fresh and interesting
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The biggest challenge we faced is when determining the closest tourist location with the best rating. Some locations that offer local products are also a challenge because we have to contact owners of local product in the form of snacks, heavy meals and drinks. This is a very interesting challenge because by highlighting features like this, the tourists who come to Banyuwangi can find out their destination without having to be confused looking for a place to sell typical Banyuwangi food or natural attractions that only exist in Banyuwangi.
