                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We imagined how people feel standing at the bus stop and tried to create an ideal interface for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a map that shows buses' path and a schedule to see which bus will come first. You can also find a places that are currently nearby and watch a commercial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used php for back-end and html/css+bootstrap for front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a great idea but no time to implement everything. That is why our project is more like a concept than a finalized work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That it is really difficult to manage the work.
