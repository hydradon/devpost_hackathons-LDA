                    Inspiration: We were all taking online classes and were complaining about how boring it was. So we decided to make learning fun and engaging. A concept of how we, ourselves would like to enjoy a class.

                    What it does: Engages students in a 3D environment to promote learning through the use of visuals and movement

                    How I built it: Using C##, Unity, Blender, and Inventor
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Many errors from packages downloaded from an older version of Unity
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: We are proud of being able to add correct and pretty accurate textures to our objects and able to scale them accordingly.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: We as a team have been introduced to C##, Unity and Blender. Keep in mind that we had no experience with MR or game development.

                <h2>
                    What's next for A Class Room Out Of This World!!: We hope to expand this idea out to more schools and help them engage their students and keep them interested in learning for the future generations to come!
