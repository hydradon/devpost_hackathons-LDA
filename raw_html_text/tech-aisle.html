                <p>
                    My inspiration is the challenges of not able to do a thorough follow-up with new Women-In-Tech entrants which makes them loose interest in the community as well as technology it self.

                <p>
                    So building was challenging because we had to collaborate from distances apart.

                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about Facebook tools and how we could use them to increase the services we provide. Examples of some of the tools integrated on our platform are Facebook chat messenger,Facebook instant articles,Facebook for work e.t.c
