                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a simple handsfree banking interface to perform simple actions that students do on a daily basis. We also wanted to find a way to authenticate users that is secure yet simple and hassle-free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Authenticates users based on a tiered authentication system and a randomly-generated four-word passphrase. Some actions requiring elevated permissions ask the user for the last 4 digits of their account number.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The logic flow is done by VoiceFlow which is supplemented with multiple Firebase Cloud Functions written in JavaScript that read and write from a Firebase database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a way to make it easy to use yet still building in enough friction to make it secure and reduce accidental actions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing the voice interactions around an intuitive yet relatively secure authentication system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about building apps for voice interaction. It was difficult getting out of the mindset of conventional UI-based applications but we think we managed to learn a lot about voice apps.

                    What's next for RBC Voice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better language processing - Ability to process more complex statements with more information instead of splitting it up.
