                    We believe in making aid even easier to access for those in need whether that would come in the form of education, job experience, or wellness. It is important that these trifecta of modern needs are fullfilled not just for those in dire need, but also for those who believe that they might face financial crisis. With the overload of information regarding these needs floating about the internet, we compiled them in a way that makes it easier to understand and access.

                    &emsp;In addition, this site tracks the progress made towards the end goal, which is to make progress in achieving the trifecta of needs. Being able to track one's own progress not only gives vision of what else needs to be accomplished, but also a sense of achievement for doing so.
