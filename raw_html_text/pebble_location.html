                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got really excited by all the technologies and platforms offered and we wanted to push the possibilities on how they could be combined.  We decided to use geographical data from the pebble watch and map it in Esri.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now we have two halves of a functioning concept: we programmed the pebble watch to gather the user's longitude and latitude in Bluemix IoT, and we also have an Esri map that can display a point at a specified location.  We got stuck combining the two parts.  So the Esri map displays a point, but it is not the pebble's location at the moment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Marley and Meysam collaborated on the Pebble programming, and then Marley developed and finalized the Pebble programming while Meysam did the Esri and Node Red programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got stuck In the logic of the Node Red component, which acts as a bridge between the two halves of our project.  The location data from the pebble watch never reaches the Esri http server, because it gets lost during a join operation with the http request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the concept of pairing two platforms (Bluemix and Esri) that have not yet been combined.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is Marley's first hackathon and she learned about how to navigate open source apis and tools and she can't wait to do more.  Meysam used Node Red for the first time and can't wait to draft more data and server interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pebble_Location
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We conceived of Pebble Location as a tool for other developers who want to be able to use the Pebble in a new way.  Now, with the click of a button, users could theoretically have access to any service that would require their location such as getting simple directions and gaining bearings, finding local businesses, finding and visualizing other nearby Pebble users, and logging personal data.  Once we fix the protocols in the Node Red, the possibilities are truly endless.
