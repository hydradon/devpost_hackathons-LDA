                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was inspired by the surprising number of restaraunts that offer discounted food to college students near ETSU. There are many restaraunts that have $1/slice nights, $1/draft nights, or just 15% for students. Most students on campus at ETSU only know of maybe 2-3 restaurants that offer these deals, but there are so many more that students could be taking advantage of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows a restaurant owner/manager to login and post the deals that they offer. These could be recurring deals such as student discounted rates, or they could be a one time deal such as offering BOGO sandwiches.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I went to the Firebase workshop and learned about using Firebase. I sort've threw together a proof-of-concept web app based on Firebase tutorials and examples.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Testing the app was sometimes difficult while hosting it at localhost, for some reason. I then tried to upload to firebase, but ran into more issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of getting a semi-working product ready.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about the Firebase tools that are available.

                <h2>
                    What's next for SilverBack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to keep working on SilverBack, and then start marketing it to restaurants that are around ETSU. I'll probably come up with a more marketable name, as well. My vision for SilverBack would be to get it up and running, then strongly urge restaurant owners to sign up and use the app for a year or so. I hope to track the number of college students who go to the restaurant as a result of the app. After demoing the application for a year or so, I hope to sell it as a subscription marketing platform to local restaurants. For example, a restaurant may pay $500 per year to be allowed to advertise on SilverBack.
