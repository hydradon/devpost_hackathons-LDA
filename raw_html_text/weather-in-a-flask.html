                    We first wanted to build an app called Rinder in which we could help families decide on which restaurants to eat at. However, as we progressed we had trouble connecting our app with our flask server. These problems latter doomed the project and we were forced to change our idea with little hacking time remaining. So, we had an open weather API at our disposal. I then set up the flask and had the other group members work on the UI. That is how the weather in a flask was born. We are all programmers who have minimal experience in frontend and backend programming and in these 24 hours, we have gained immense knowledge of these core principals.
