                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When traveling, a tourist has to research the culture of the foreign nation in order to prevent embarrassing cultural misunderstandings and download multiple apps (such as a currency converter and a translation app) in an attempt to survive in a foreign land. These tasks overburden tourists that are traveling abroad to escape the business and stress of life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app determines the tourist's location using Google Maps and provides tourists with information on the values, traditions, and etiquette of the nation they are visiting. It also contains a table of common phrases with their translation in the foreign country's language. The app gives the tourist the option to change the country and language so that they can look at the customs of other nations and see common phrases translated into other languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We brainstormed the features that we wanted our app to have and then listed the tasks that we needed to accomplish in order to have each feature. Next, we delegated the tasks and developed our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of issues with deprecated classes and methods. We found a lot of tutorials and examples code online and were not able to use it because it had methods are now deprecated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the fact that we were able to determine the tourist's location using the Google Maps API. It took us 12 hours to get this process to work because we had difficulty getting the API key to work. It took us a while to figure out that we needed to make a new key for each file in the software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a database on mySequl. This database was used to store information on different cultures. We also learned how to connect APIs to websites and use the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hermes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add a feature that will allow natives to edit the cultural information about their country and provide travel advice. We would expand our website so that it would include information on more countries and translations in more languages.
