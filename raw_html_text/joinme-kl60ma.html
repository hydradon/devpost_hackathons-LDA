                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being college freshman, we've had experiences where it's hard to make friends and even harder to become close to them. For this reason we wanted to develop a platform for friends to create groups with each other. These groups can be anything from study groups to workout partners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app JoinMe allows users to log in with Snapchat and create groups with their friends. The app goes through the user's contacts and if they have the JoinMe app downloaded they can invite them to join their group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift and Xcode to build the app. We also implemented Snapchat's Login Kit and Bitmoji kit to allow us to collect user info.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dividing work and utilizing Git. Problems with learning new technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement Snapkit and Firebase into our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about Swift and IOS development. We also learned about databases and how we can store and use user data with them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JoinMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement more of the features we planned to have in the app.
