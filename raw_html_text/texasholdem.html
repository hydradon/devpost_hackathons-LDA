                    This being the first official MLH Hackathon attended by us, Alvie and I decided to spend all of our time learning something new. We spent a great deal of time wondering what to make until I remembered about the deck of cards the recruiters from SIG had given me. Seeing as how they use a lot of C#, we took this as a great opportunity to learn C# as well as make something that SIG really loves:

                    It took us around 7 of straight work and lots of googling to structure our program. Unfortunately, we saved the worst part for last. The thing is, in Poker there are approximately 2,598,960 possible
