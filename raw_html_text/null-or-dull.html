                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the ShellHacks kickoff where we played Quiplash, it was a blast playing the online game where each game is as good as their users' creativity. Additionally, I just sold my headphones, so when Chase Bank said they were giving away headphones as a reward for their challenge, I decided to make my hack an interactive game between two teams about CS topics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My webapp's setup is similar to Quiplash, has a host open a lobby, and users enter a lobby picking one of two teams. Whenever the hosts decides to start, the users are booted into the quiz.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Flask as a backend, mongo for the database, and foundation CSS to help build it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly time limits, I have a lot more features that would make the game more fun and/or funny, like Quiplash. Like implementing a quiz system where one group can interact with the other group's question before the other reads it, or setting up a python VM to run code, so that I can ask easy algorithm questions, and points are awarded for being the first to obtain the desired output, as well as points for being faster than the other group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, making the game less serious with voice-acting like Quiplash would greatly enhance the enjoyability of the game.
