                    With the algo trader you can put in the ticker of a stock and instantly see the Financial Score, Growth Score, and its relation to the rolling mean of the stock you put in. If the scores are high and the rolling mean is lower than the actually stock price you can assume it's being undervalues and you should buy it. On the flip side if the scores are low and the rolling mean is lower than the current price of the stock you can assume its being overvalued and it would be a good time to sell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Essentially the AlgoTrader puts you in a position to see a more accurate value of a stock and make decisions to increase your long term gains by consistently selling when overvalued and buying when undervalued.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Goldman Sach's API for the different scores that rated the companies health over all and coupled that with the rolling mean of a stock pulled from the IEXFinance api and used that to compute the Bollinger bands in relation to the score.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time using some of the API's I used in the project, while the information being pulled from the API was invaluable it took some time to use it exactly as intented.
