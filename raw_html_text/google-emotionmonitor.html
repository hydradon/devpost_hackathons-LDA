                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many companies in the world today are developing products with the goal of entering the personal lives of people around the world. And If Google, among these companies, is also intending to help out their users with everyday life, why not go a step further to provide support their users during hard times?

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EmotionTracker keeps track of your emotions over a period of time and performs actions accordingly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Dialoglow and connected it to firebase with a Webhook to which we deployed the google assistant's fulfillment code from our device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't know Javascript, and I didn't know how to use Actions on Google before. Other team members were the same.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully built the core product of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    javascript, node, firebase, general coding intuition
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EmotionTracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be interesting if we could see this algorithm integrated into the core assistant functionality. It would make a very large social impact.
