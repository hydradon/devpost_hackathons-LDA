                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the first round, we built an automatic pipettor that helps handle the grunt work in the lab. We felt inspired by the numerous possibilities that such a machine could bring both to public health and research. With automatic pipetting, we can potentially address the numerous health problems, such as the feeble reach of health diagnostics in society today. We decided to build an application machine of the mobile cloud lab
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile Diagnostics provide a framework to screen for serious diseases and illnesses, such as cancer, renal diseases, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and other chronic and/or serious ailments. Using the automate pipetting procedures for experiments in Mobile Cloud Lab we've built before, we can create an autonomous machine in the household that keeps constant vigilance on the health of its owners. People merely have to input a little saliva in to the machine, and the machine returns the physical health of the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a physical frame with aluminum rods. We then used Arduino and Raspberry Pi to automate the pipetting procedures in cloud software. The design of the project is inspired by the systematic framework of 3D printers.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled initially to 3D print and laser cut everything within the time limit.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of Mobile Diagnostic's improved functionality, stability, and exterior design as well as it's increased scope.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement microprocessors, use Arduinos, design basic hardware, and work in teams in highly stressful settings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mobile Diagnostics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to acquire more biomedical medium to make Mobile Diagnostics a commercial product. These reagents are relatively accessible through public vendors and biotech companies.
