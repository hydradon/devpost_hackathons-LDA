                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration was a website that had a bunch of python project ideas. I saw a random number generator and decided to make my own as the hackathon project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My password generator first asks the user if he wants spaces, tabs, etc. Then it asks how many passwords it should make. After that, it asks for the length of the password(s).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I just coded it in python 3.6 since that was the only language I knew.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a challenge that was I had to type each thing on the keyboard separately in the list. I overcame this by using string.letters+string.digits+string.puncuation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of learning import string and ascii.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more in python by spending a lot of time in it.
                </p>

                    What's next for Random password generator in python

                <p>
                    I think I can improve this by getting into pygame so there is like a visual.
