                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When Jeremy Bloom discussed about LA2024, I felt that it was my calling to tackle on the challenges he offered. Being born and raised in LA, I want to make sure that athletes have the best LA experience and meet with athletes across the globe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This platform would have a datamap of Los Angeles located in the lobby. It would should a map of events, venues, etc. in Los Angeles along with who would be attending from the Olympic Village. For the user, an app will be designed which would require the user to log into it through twitter and match them with events suitable to them and grouping them with athletes that'll be attending the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the datamap using Javascript. By using Mapbox.js and Leaflet.js, I loaded datasets provided by the City of LA and LA Geohub to pinpoint sport venues, beaches and marinas, and musems all over Los Angeles to show how the map would be used in the lobby of the village. As for the user, I didn't get a chance to work on that part. The goal for that part was to use the Twitter API for oauthentication and create a user profile for the athlete to match them with events.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the map. I had a hard time implementing the map because I couldn't the tileJSON map properly, along with layering the geoJSON maps that have the coordinates of beaches, museums, and sport venues. It took time, patience and assistance from mentors, Daniel, and the resources provided from the hackathon.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My major accomplishment is having a datamap of Los Angeles with popular venues and filter option.

                <p>
                    I learned new javascript frameworks, traversing through datasets, and improved my web development skills.

                    What's next for Social Conference
                </h2>

                    My future goals for Social Conference is implementing this platform in hotels for LA2024 Olympic fans and conferences around the world, so attendees can feel like a local.
