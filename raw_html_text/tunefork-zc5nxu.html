                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by other artists' inspiration and wanting to see people get credit when others heavily borrowed from their work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows artists to share their multitracks.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used django to quickly setup both the doman logic and the data base.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one person on our team had previously used django.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're proud that we worked together.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to rapidly deploy a project with django.
                </p>
