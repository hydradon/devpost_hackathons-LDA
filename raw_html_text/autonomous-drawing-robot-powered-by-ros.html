                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired on projects in where a drawing is projected onto a surface and based on the techniques acquired in the image processing and robotics field during our Master's degree.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user acquires a picture and send it to the processor, which gets the contour of this image and send commands to the robot to autonomously begin the drawing of these contours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The redBot Inventor's kit made by sparkfun is used as the autonomous vehicle; along with the dragonboard 410c a ROS has been integrated and the processing of the images and self navigation can be remotely controlled from a computer over the network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The path is computed by processing an image, extracting its contours and a final algorithm finds an acceptable path to follow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting used to the hardware was one of the first problems as connection problems were faced; and some not supported hardware was acquired and not able to be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some other issues implies the control of the navigation using just the encoders of the wheels which makes the navigation a little uncertain, which is reasonable acocording to the kit used for the development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Achieving robot navigation with some hardware limitations and the integration of simple hardware along with ROS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Setting up a generic controller based on ROS, easily configurable for any other differential vehicle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used of different hardware and sensors, along with the programming of the arduino that we have barely used through our master.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for autonomous drawing robot powered by ROS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Development of a better navigation and position estimation by adding more robust sensors; and a camera to get a better exploration of the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding a pen and controling it (i.e servo motor) in order to draw the desired sketch. Currently its path is published to RVIZ using markers.
