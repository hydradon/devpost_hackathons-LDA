                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was tired of opening and closing my jars, using primitive human powered means. After a great spiritual awakening I realized that in a world of AI, robotics, and teledildonics opening and closing jars is the last great injustice faced by humanity on our path to becoming GODs of the natural world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NO other problem faced by humanity today compares to our need to have autonomous jar opening, and during this hackathon I decided to take on this challenge and save the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My project dares to dream of world where containers open themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an arduino uno, a button, and a motor driver. I also designed a part to be 3D printed, for the device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being bold enough to solve one of the worst issues humanity faces today. Not world peace, not hungry, autonomous jar opening.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jar Opener
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future the jar opener won't just open jars. It'll be able to open hearts.
