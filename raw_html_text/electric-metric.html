                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by MassCEC, we wanted to enhance more sustainable modes of transportation by promoting electric vehicles over gas powered cars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Electric Metric is an interactive experience that provides a metric tool for showing how much drivers can save by switching to electric vehicles instead of those powered by gas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded on the Cloud 9 platform with HTML and CSS for the front end along with JavaScript and Python on the back end. Finally, we used Flask to connect the back end with front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble connecting our Flask back end variables with our front end variables. Additionally, we spent time debugging our "Calculate cost" button on our first page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we managed to integrate Flask to connect our front end with back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to add a video to our backgrounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Electric Metric
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be awesome to integrate a database with our tool to provide distinct car options for comparison. Another feature would be a calculation of how much mileage it would take to profit from the initial investment of purchasing an electric car.
