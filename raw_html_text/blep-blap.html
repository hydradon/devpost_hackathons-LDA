                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all computer science students who enjoy puzzles and writing software, and wanted to make a game that is also educational, so we decided to do it based on graph theory, which we've all learned through our discrete mathematics courses.

                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    There are four different modes as of now including Euler Trails, Euler Cycles, Hamiltonian Paths, and Hamiltonian Circuits.

                    Using React and a C# application to generate the puzzles
