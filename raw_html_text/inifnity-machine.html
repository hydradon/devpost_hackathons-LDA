                    Talking with Chris from Microsoft about how much of a pain it is to program his SPDS :)

                    Input your favorite song*, and IM automatically samples, slices, categorizes, and organizes the component elements into a playable sample kit.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's not built yet! But thanks to the input of several participants, creators, and sponsors (especially Ilya, Mitch, CJ, Cole, Rush, Patrick, and the reps from Microsoft) I've been able to develop an approach.

                <p>
                    I knew just practically zero about machine learning before this weekend. Now I feel confident about a practical application in a product with qualitatively validated market opportunity.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How valuable it is for Product folks to know how things are built, if not how to actually build them.
