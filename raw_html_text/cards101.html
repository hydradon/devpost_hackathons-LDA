                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The lack of good online TCG (Trading Card Game) applications. The best example for bad applications for a TCG would be the applications for MTG (Magic the Gathering). The best way to make a deck is using an ugly, slow, and sometimes even not working website, untap.in
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an API for making TCG applications, which allows future developers to create deck builders, games, and many more creative applications. Using that API, we also made a MTG deck editor. This allows users to log in / register, get all the cards, their descriptions and images. The deck editor allows them to create, remove, and save decks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The deck editor was made using python (pygame graphics). It connects to a web server running the API, made using Flask, to retrieve card and account information.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a program to collect all the cards and their data.
Sorting through tens of thousands of cards.
Creating interesting UI design with raw level pygame graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to go beyond the challenges listed above.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While it may seem like a good idea to work the entire time period without any rest, doing so ends up with you making even more mistakes. We experienced that first hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hideaway?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This deck editor can be extended to allow pvp duels with the MTG decks, making it very useful for lots of card players. This is what we plan on doing.
