                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overfilling landfills, loss of millions, polluted oceans. We wanted to find a way to sustain and utilize natural resources to their maximum. That means reusing and recycling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our automatic trashcan will filter based on what type of material the product is. If it's a plastic bottle, it will put it in the recycling area. If it's regular trash, then it will put it with the other trash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized python and the raspberry pi to operate the servo to move the trash into the specific area. We used clarifai and trained our own model to accurately describe the item that we have. It will give us a list of associated concepts and tags along with the percentage of accuracy.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of having the camera correctly recognize the object an be able to tell what we're looking at.
