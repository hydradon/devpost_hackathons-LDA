                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do you ever wake up in the morning and have no idea what to wear? Or you shop for hours and can't find exactly what you're looking for? This is our solution!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ClosetChic is your digital closet. It uses the GPS and temperature sensors on the Intel Edison to track your location and the weather. It then suggests outfits for you to wear based on this data. It also learns your style and suggests new clothes for you to buy at great discounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Development and Java for the app and the Intel Edison and Arduino for Hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to control the color on the monitor and turn the sound on and off on the hardware
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used many sensors on the Edison and they all work! Plus, we developed an app for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time working with the Edison and the Android App Development Program.

                    The ultimate goal for this project would be a Hannah Montana closet!
