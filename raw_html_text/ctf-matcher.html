                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were just brainstorming ideas and we had this idea. It seemed feasible and useful, so we decided to go for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's like a Tinder, except is matches people together who want to do similar things. For example, if you want to go to a Habs game but none of your friends don't want to go (or, if you do not have friends), you can put yourself into the database. When someone else also wants to watch a Habs game adds themself, the system will match them together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Huge learning curve; we're all beginner programmers (we only finished one computer science course). It was hard to come up with something useful that we could make with our skills. Additionally, we wanted to include some sort of user interface, and that was something completely new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a user interface on Java!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perseverance: we had to switch between many languages and tried a lot of things that crashed and burnt, but in the end it worked.
                </p>

                    What's next for CTF Matcher
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe a nicer user interface
                </p>
