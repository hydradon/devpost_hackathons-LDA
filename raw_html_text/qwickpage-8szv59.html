                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here's the story that inspired Qwickpage...
                    <strong>
                        My elder brother Okebulu
                    </strong>
                    !. A writer and poet, so creative with words he can bring a picture to live with his stories. His passion for poetry has even placed him in positions to meet with some of Nigeria's fineness writers, the likes of Wole Soyinka and Chimamanda Adiche. But Oke's (As we casually call him) major challenge was having a professional identity on the internet to connect with his audience. This was mostly possible with websites.
    Well, Oke isn't earning yet and can't cover the cost of developing and maintaining a website(not even a developer)  and this has so far left him stranded as he feels he isn't getting enough from some social media platforms.
    This is a major challenge so many individuals and business in Africa face. So my team and I set to build a community of these individuals sharing their values through their professional identity at no cost at all.

                    <strong>
                        Business page

                <p>
                    It was entirely a remote work since I live in the western part of Nigeria(Lagos), and my team mates lived in the eastern and southern part of the country (Owerri and Akwa Ibom, Nigeria).  I developed most of the Front end designs using JQuery, HTML, CSS and Javascript  as well as the product designs using Figma and Adobe XD, Aniekan and Stephen, my team mates worked mostly on the backend using the Laravel framework, and Christian was our project manager. We critically considered our user's security and privacy by employing the use of some software and platforms like
                    <strong>
                        Cloudflare, SSL and privacy policy to guide our users
