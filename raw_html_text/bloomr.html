                    WHY BLOOMR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we at Team Bloomr believe in the transformative power and good of public service, we want to share information on volunteer opportunities more easily and effectively in our community. We love when people can organize and work together not for any individual profit but for the greater purpose of helping out one another and making our society a better place, and we thought it would be amazing to help spread and foster these ideals with the internet and social networking. Through much brainstorming, Bloomr is what we came up with. We are proud to present what we can for HackingEDU, but development for Bloomr doesn't stop here!

                    WHAT INSPIRED US
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all part of a non-profit student organization at Cal called REACH! that serves the under-resourced community around California. We constantly need volunteers and mentors for our events, so we came up with this platform where students at Cal can have a consolidated area to find and post local opportunities for not just REACH!, but for all student organizations.

                    CHALLENGES
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was some of our first time doing Mobile Development and first Hack-a-thon, so a majority of the time we were trying to work around how to use the IDE. However, we all still have a great time, and still managed to complete the main focus of our project.
