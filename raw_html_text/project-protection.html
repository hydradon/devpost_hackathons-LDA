                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have heard about many deaths and illnesses around the world due to the public unawareness about the diseases prevalent near them. So, we wanted to give the public easy access to the major epidemics prevalent in a certain area through an understandable visual representation, so the rapid spread of epidemics can be controlled.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website has a map of the United States containing all the major epidemics in an area specified by the user, displayed through circles. The circles are sized according to the percentage of cases of that specific disease in the area, and the circles are color coded by disease. The map is interactive and adaptable to the needs of the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used data from the CDC for all the different states in America, and ran algorithms to find the average percentage of the disease in the state. We created algorithms in Python to make the interactive map using coordinates for the United States, and we displayed the according circles for each disease and state. Finally, we used HTML to design the website with additional interactive graphics and information on the epidemics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty compiling the large amount of data from the CDC, and incorporating certain graphics into the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a very accurate visual representation of the data, and we continued with the project when it became difficult. When we were not able to incorporate a zoom and click function into our map, we devised another method to magnify the map, without zooming in a separate window.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create algorithms for many interactive and graphical aspects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, such as the zoom function, Tooltips, and Skillbars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Protection:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expanding the map from the United States to the world, and incorporate additional epidemics. We would also like to program it to become self-updating on current diseases, which will benefit the society in many ways.
