                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As teenagers ourselves, we know the problems we face every day and the one main problem that almost all of us teenagers face is procrastination - even in the middle of something important, say a huge homework assignment that is due the next, we can never give up the "one more minute" of social media. So we decided to make an app to help teens to overcome procrastination, and that inspired us to come up with this idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app takes 3 inputs from the user for each task he/she wants to accomplish, namely the name of the task, the amount of time they think it will take them to finish it and the grade value it has (if any). The app will run in the background and make sure that the users don't use the apps (such as social media) for too long and get distracted, warning them through notifications, etc. The app will also help them track their progress through their work, helping over time to reduce the time it takes to finish those tasks. This app follows a reward model, by allowing more time in social media, etc if the teens finish their work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Android studio, using discord for coordination. The app starts with a login page, where the users will have an account, which will soon be stored in firebase to have a global account, then in the second screen, the users can input the data required for the app to function, which is now stored in a local array list, but soon will be stored online after firebase integration is complete. The app is made to run in the background when the user wants to use it, it has a timer which counts down, at the end of which the users will be warned that they spent too much time away from work/studies and will help them get away from the apps they are addicted to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As all the members of our team had different programming backgrounds, it was hard to find a topic that all of us can use our talents in. Apart from that, we faced a bit of challenge in getting the timer to run properly in the background, which we were mostly able to fix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We almost finished our product and maintained the comfort level of our 0teammates considering the fact that this hackathon is our first product-oriented hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to efficiently use the android studio to create android applications. We also gained experience in time management and teamwork which helped us overcome challenges.
                </p>

                    What's next for No time wasted.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using user input and firebase database to store user info and learn about users and the app itself setting times for the user.
