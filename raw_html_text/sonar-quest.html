                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After visiting a CS Game Design Senior Capstone Project fair a couple of weeks ago with my friends we were seriously struck by a game called "Five Stars In The Dark". It is an audio-based game where you are a taxi driver who must use a keen sense of sound to navigate a busy city and deliver the passengers safely and effectively. This example in conjunction with our passion to play videogames, we decide to create a videogame that is both inclusive and challenging to the individual, independent of their ability to see, only hear. We feel videogames play a fundamental aspect in entertainment, creativity, relaxation, and stress management. We feel its unfair most games are geared towards individuals who are fully able to see, because of this we put our all in creating a game that promotes inclusivity in this subject.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a 2D game with controls W, A, S, D where the player must find the emitting source of sound hidden in the maze. The player cannot see where the sound is being emitted from, only follow its sound cues. The source of sound will increase in pitch as the player gets closer to it. The catch is that there are invisible obstacles between the source of the sound and the player. The player's heartbeat will increase in volume as the player gets close to the obstacles. If the player makes contact with the obstacles, the player is respawned at the start point and must start the journey again, hopefully having a better idea where the obstacles are. The goal is to successfully reach the source of the sound without colliding with any of the obstacles.

                <h2>
                    How I built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built only using the java library called processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to implement sound cues that both sounded good and functioned well with the game. The sounds in the game are not perfect and sometimes produce slight cuts and static noises. It was also difficult to come to a general idea of what the game was going to function like, the game went from many iterations and trial and error. The team I was working with was not very experienced with processing, we were delayed by having to learn things on the fly.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that the game overall functions well despite the bugs. What we are most proud of is that it is a fun game that is both challenging and unique.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is unrealistic to try and learn how to use building blocks while you are attempting to build stuff with them simultaneously.
                </p>

                    We hope to further develop this game in the future
