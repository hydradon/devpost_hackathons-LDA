                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to respond to several of the challenges, because they had a common point : making the patient/customer's experience more reassuring and funny.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a robot which is an assistant of some sort. His purpose is to provide the patient/customer with information (to guide him through the hospital for instance)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Base was made with the laser-cutting machine. Robot is controlled through the STM32 Nucleo microcontroller, with an LCD display to exchange with the outside world. We worked on an Android app to communicate through NFC tag.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Capgemini, Meritis, Bloomberg, Lectra

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used both hardware and software. We worked as a team the whole time, with complementary skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was pretty exhausting, but it made us stretch our limits.

                <p>
                    FunkyBot could be adapted to several environments
