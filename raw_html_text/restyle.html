                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fashion industry has a massive issue with the pollution caused by manufacturing and production. There is a growing awareness of this problem causing a surge of sustainable fashion brands, however, still fast fashion remains dominant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is because fast fashion brands are appealing due to their low price point while having designs relatively similar to more expensive brands. This allows consumers to spend less money while obtaining access to a greater variety of styles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, sustainable fashion practices are expensive due to higher quality and ethical practices, thus making it quite difficult to lower their prices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our applications aims to aid sustainable brands in being more accessible and appealing to consumers through a subscription-based service. A consumer would pay a subscription fee in order to gain access to our library of sustainable clothes. By doing so, the consumer is able to access sustainable fashion at a lower price point while still accessing a wide variety of styles. In addition, the quality of their clothes would improve. Sustainable brands only use high-quality textiles that are more durable and recyclable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This further benefits sustainable brands by providing a means to reclaim older and worn clothes to be recycled into new textiles again to be made into new clothing. This reduces the need for mass production and manufacturing. Providing a means for the industry to transition to a close loop production model.
