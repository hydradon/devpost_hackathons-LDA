                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personal loans between friends pose a peculiar predicament, where forgetful friends are often forgiven, and your precious money disappears with no return.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app Crippling Debtors eliminates forgetful debtors through tracking and managing all your personal loans and notifying your debtors when due dates approach, via our automated SMS notification system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web interface was built using Node.js and EJS, and connected to a MySQL Database server. We integrated the data with our own automated SMS notification API using Standard Library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Hack Idea should be finalized prior to the event, as we took a while to agree upon an idea to implement, suffering a great lack of sleep as a consequence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Crippling Debtors
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to extend our services through a Facebook Messenger bot, and design a database structure which can track the bi-directional relationships between Facebook friends, notify through Facebook messages, and provide online payment methods.
