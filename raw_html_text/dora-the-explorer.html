                    Dora The Explorer (named for one of our teammates) is a travelblog platform for students studying abroad around the world. by simply selecting a relevant country, they can see all the other students who have studied there and read about their adventures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We picked this project because we wanted to learn about backend web development with Django, and so everything was built with django on heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a bit of a hard time getting the django backend to work well, and integrating a number of front end javascript plugins into the website, but mostly things worked. By the end however, we had unresolved static file issues: for unclear reasons, they would fail to display at times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, we learned how to use Django and build fully scaleable webapps
                </p>
