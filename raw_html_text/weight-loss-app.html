                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from a friend who wants more from a weight loss app. Other apps lacked on educating how to lose weight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a calculator that estimate how long and the best path to lose a desired amount of weight based on your current weight, age, sex, and activeness. It will also give hints on bettering a user's current diet.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to develop the application.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we did not finish the application. Its development will continue past HackRU.
