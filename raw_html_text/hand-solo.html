                        Due to hardware failures and construction issues this project is incomplete and not even functioning. Its unfortunate, but we learned a lot about Arduino and Windows drivers and overall had a great experience. We will improve our planning for future hackathons and hopefully make a worth while project in the future.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use keyboards everyday as programmers and gamers. We take the keyboard layout for granted as it its what feels right for us. But for those less fortunate a keyboard designed for two hands could be less than optimal. So we decided to attempt and solve that issue with a one handed keyboard of our own design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hand Solo is a one handed keyboard designed to allow for one handed typing with minimal hand movement. Hand Solo will take advantage of predictive typing to allow for a more streamlined typing experience during everyday web browsing.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keys bought from Novel Keys paired with an Arduino Pro Micro and enclosed in a wonderful cardboard enclosure.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Failures in hardware and construction led to a incomplete and non working project.
