                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just an idea I've had for a little while. I finished my first game a little while ago, wanted to try my hand at making another one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the time of submission, nothing! Almost, anyway... All that works right now is the swipe input. Swiping left moves the player counter-clockwise along an elliptical path, swiping right moves the player clockwise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Unity engine and C#. What I did differently than my first game was that I tried to get as much planned on paper before starting on any kind of code. This definitely felt less stressful and more productive.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting everything consistent on paper...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sticking to (as far as I know) good object oriented programming practices instead of just being lazy and leaving everything to Unity.
                </p>

                    What I learned

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        my approach to finite state machines isn't necessarily the best in terms of modularity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        how to set things up on paper and resolve issues there before running into them after most of the issue's already been programmed...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        implementing swipe controls in unity using events.
                    </li>
                </ul>
