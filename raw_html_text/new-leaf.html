                </h2>
                <p>
                    67% of NYC youth under the age of 12 were incarcerated in 2016.1 out of every 5 youth (21%) who are brought before the court with a delinquency case are detained. Those incarcerated as a juvenile are 39% less likely to graduate from high school and are 41% more likely to have entered adult prison by age 25. With this criminal record, they have a difficult time getting jobs. Most companies do not hire employees without a clear record. That&rsquo;s where New Leaf comes in. New Leaf aims to help prisoners and ex-prisoners restart their lives by aiding them on the process of getting jobs. Through resume building, education mentorships, and mental help, New Leaf helps prepare these people to be job-ready. We then work to help place all of our users in a job.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript front end development, and Django, python and SQL for backend.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to add additional features showing services we wanted to offer, such as educational resources. Hence, our homepage is incomplete.  We were also  unable to put in all the forms in the database because of time so we disabled them.

                <p>
                    As a team of only two people, we're proud of the progress we made. If we had additional time, we're sure we would have completed the project successfully

                    We learned time management  and not original goals can be accomplished
