                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Public transit is AWESOME, but no one knows how to find the awesome STUFF on it. Unless you're 100 years old and have memorized ALL the bus routes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app finds your location, then finds the bus stop nearest you. It then searches along the routes used by that stop to find the attractions that are X minutes distance FROM that stop.
                </p>
