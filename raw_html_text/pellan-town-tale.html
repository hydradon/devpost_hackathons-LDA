                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like to play old text-based RPGs, and one of the main games I played when I was in middle school was a text-based MMORPG. I wanted to do a project that wasn't too stressful and helped solidify my Python skills, so I wrote this game from the ground up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player has just arrived at a small town named Pellan town. The townsfolk seem wary of this new arrival, and seem to be particularly scared of the catacomb in the graveyard in the outskirts of town.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a simple text based adventure game where the user inputs commands to interact with the world around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I coded this in Python 3, mainly focusing on utilizing its object-oriented aspects. Zones are read in and saved in an object from .txt config, as are NPCs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing this was a bit of a challenge. Handling how interactions are handled and how information of the area around the player is handled took some thinking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I made this and it's not entirely broken.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More about object-oriented Python 3. That Python is amazing, and can do things like having a dictionary of functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for pellan-town-tale
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I might continue to work on it. I want to add more interactions to the NPCs and have stuff like an item drop system, a shop system, and a stats system.
