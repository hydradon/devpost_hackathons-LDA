                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My sister experiences chronic pain after a fatal accident. I hate that she can't seek guidance or support from anyone else who has experienced chronic pain because they are hard to find.
                </p>

                <h1>
                    imnotguilty connects those in chronic pain to help guide, mentor, encourage and support each other going through the same journey.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a demo on Wix and Facebook group.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That it can be bigger than ben hur...need to condense it down to just a simple service to stay true to the core of what it is supposed to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pitching my idea!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make the application process as easy as possible. Those with chronic pain shouldn't have to rehash or relive their experience, so I'm going to use a design led approach to obtaining the correct information that can best provide mentoring opportunities for those in pain.

                <p>
                    Building a test or minimum viable product. There were SO many amazing people at our hackathon, I would love to collaborate, learn and work with anyone willing to join forces and share ideas. Just yell out to me and we can coordinate.
