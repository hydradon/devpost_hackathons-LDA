                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From our experiences of travel, we wanted to create the best application that reduces our stress on tracking each of our expenses and plans, so that we can focus more on the fun parts of traveling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application keeps track of each of our expenses and transactions, allows us to write up our journals each day, and overlooks our whole trip in one map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift to create the front-end of an iOS application and tried using a server side Swift framework called Vapor for the backend. We used Google Cloud for the DB and utilized postgreSQL integrated with Google Cloud SQL to save and fetch data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, it was our first time using the swift, which made the whole project challenging. Our xCode application kept unexpectedly closing itself, which made it harder to keep track of how far we've worked or what codes have disappeared. Then, combining all of our separate works into one project was difficult and time-consuming. Lastly, it was one of our team member's first time using Vapor, which made him confusing with the new type of language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our idea for the application, and how dedicated we were as a group to build this application. The little details or aesthetics are beautiful, and incorporating maps, pictures, and tables in xCode were something to be proud of as first time Swift users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Swift and manage time. Also, we learned that every 2 hours of work, you need at least 5 minutes of break to give your brain a little rest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CoCoTravel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to incorporate ability to share each groups travel plans and expenses so that everyone who went to the trip together can edit together. Also, we are going to allow people, who are interested in traveling to one specific place, to see other past travelers' journals and expenses to give them the data or information of their travel plan.
