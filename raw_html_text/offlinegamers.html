                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowing about Twilio and me and my team member being so passionate about gaming, once we thought about the idea we knew we had to go through with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anyone can take their phones out and text the specific number and they will be able to text the number with their in game names of their favourite games with their platform of choice and they will be sent information about their game statistics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used twilio to do the talking between the server and the client and doing backend processing to identify all the different inputs the user puts in the text and process the information and choose the right api to access and retrieve the necessary information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accessing free APIs for the games we wanted to implement into the program that weren't updated fast enough or that not enough data provided by them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managed to access 6 different APIs for 6 different games to be able to give the user their stats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learnt how to access various APIs in different ways and retrieve and process all the data received while doing error handling., which was tricky.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OFFLINEgamers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is to find more improved APIs for some of the games we have implemented and then support many more games.
