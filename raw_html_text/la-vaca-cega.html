                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Chirp ecosystem allows for sharing data over audio. But what if you could utilise this system in order to synchronise performance systems between musicians.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It doesn't do that because we ran into some obstacles. Apparently system timing on systems such as laptops are quite hard to synchronise with millisecond precision. But luckily with any obstacle/constraint comes inspiration and so we decided to pivot our concept and make use of the delay in a performance piece.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The initial concept used Chirp's python SDK in order to communicate between laptops. But in order to reach more devices during the performances we moved to Javascript and used the Chirp WebAssembly SDK instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Timing is hard. Synchronisation even harder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've repurposed our obstacles to our advantage. That's pretty cool. Also, it generally works which is something that doesn't always happen during a Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping our initial scope small allowed to pivot our concept and still have a presentable result.
