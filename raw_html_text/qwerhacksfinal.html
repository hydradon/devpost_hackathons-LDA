                    Because it is often difficult from queer people to find other queer individuals, we wanted to create a platform to facilitate this process. Our website is meant to be a way for queer individuals to connect and make friends.

                    We faced many challenges in creating our website, as we did not have any prior experience with React and firebase, so we had to learn the basics of these platform and there were so many more challenges but we have 3 minutes to submit but we just wanted to say thank you to all the mentors for enduring our endless amount of questions.
