                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the United States, 250,000 drivers fall asleep at the wheel every day. This translates to more than 72,000 crashes each year. I've personally felt road fatigue and it's incredibly hard to fight, so dozing off while on the highway can happen to even the best of us. Wayke could be the app that could save your friend, your parent, your child, or even you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've created a mobile app that is integrated with the MUSE headband, pebble watch, and Grove so that it monitors your brainwaves. You can get in your car, put the MUSE headband on, turn the app on, and start driving. We use your Alpha brainwaves to gauge your drowsiness, and while your driving, if your Alphas rise above our "Doze threshold" for a prolonged period of time, your phone will emit sharp sounds and vibrate crazily while reminding you to take a break.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MUSE headband is a recently released innovation that includes sensors in a headband that monitors your brainwaves - it's basically like a portable EEG. However right now, it's mainly used for meditation. We've hacked it to the point where there's nothing chill or relaxing about Wayze. We want to keep you wide awake and on the edge of your seat. I'm personally not completely sure about the details of the app development and hardware hacking, so if you have any questions, you should Alex Jin, Jofo Domingo, or Michael Albinson.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alex and Jofo ran into a bunch of bugs while figuring out how to get the output from the MUSE to show up properly as well as automating the connection from the android app all the way to the Grove. Understanding how brainwaves work hurt our brains.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually building the damn thing!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can do amazing things in 2 days. The fact that you can hack 4-5 different things to fit together perfectly is phenomenal!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wayke
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think there are so many practical applications for Wayke. Moving forward, I think our product could be used for pilots or any workers that operate heavy machinery or any situations where you can't fall asleep. Additionally, we want to find a way to get something to physically vibrate on your body (like integrating it with a Jawbone or Fitbit)!
