                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find a cool way to use Leap Motion and decided on a web app to control the BPM of a song.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to manipulate music with the leap motion sensor and visualize yourself conducting. It is useful for music education and it's fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the user to interact wth the tempo of the music have a visual interpretation of your conducting skills using HTML and JavaScript to draw the motion of your hands.  We wrote an algorithm in JavaScript to control the tempo of the song based on the motion that the Leap Motion picked up.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to add additional conponents to our project, that could change the pitch and volume. We had Grove rotary angle and touch sensors which we could pick up values from with Arudino. However, we had trouble linking all different hardware devices and linking them together. The Ardunio controlled hardware wasn't comptable with JavaScript, we tried out jonhny-five" library and Arugate, however there were an abundance of software issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The leapmotion works perfectly and the application will work well with people using it. We also successfully wrote Arduino programs to get data from the Grove sensors even though we didn't have time to add them to our existing project.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about javascript and web apps. Arduino.

                    What's next for Conductor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a solution for successfully connecting Arduino to JavaScript and creating a better UI for the user.
