                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came over to Oahu to finish our senior project and once heard the pitches we decided to choose the office of elections project. We thought it would be a good way to help streamline the volunteer process for organized election days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a website that allow Election season volunteers to sing up for training class and see the days on which these class are held. This website can also be used as a reminder tool. We used google sites, calendar and forms to complete this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used google sites and on each page of the site we put a link to the calendar with each of the training days and times. The locations are on the calendar as well, this calendar is also connected to google maps which allows the user to  see the place of training.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about making an app at the start of the competition. Then we started and couldn't find solutions and with the little time we had, we stuck with something easy and simple to manage with the google site. A big challenge for us was assembling a proper team and finding time for this project while balancing our school and extracurricular responsibilities
