                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My son's teacher taught the class that if they sing the ABC's while washing their hands, they could significantly reduce the spread of germs.  Ever since then, my son sings a song every time he washes his hands.  I thought it would be nice to be entertained and reminded how important it is to wash your hands.
