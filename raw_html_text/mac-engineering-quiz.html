                    When all three of us met up at Deltahacks 2, we had no idea what project we were going to do. After talking for a while and looking at the available challenges, we decided to make a quiz for high school students to find out what type of engineering they should go into. This project was a great way to learn HTML which was a completely new language for us, while applying our knowledge of Java too. So, here you go! Enjoy our Mac engineering quiz!
