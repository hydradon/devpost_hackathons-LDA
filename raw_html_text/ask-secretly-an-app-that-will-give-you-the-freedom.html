                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a university student and I met with people daily. In our discussions their are so many things in our hearts that we want to say but due to shyness or our relation with them we are unable to
                    <strong>
                        express our selves
                    </strong>
                    , so because of these things i came with an idea by chance why not make an app through which we can send them
                    <strong>
                        private and secret messages without disclosing our identity
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So basically what this app does is that it allows you to
                    <strong>
                        send messages to people, friends and relatives
                    </strong>
                    . This message is sent
                    <strong>
                        secretly on Facebook
                    </strong>
                    . I chose Facebook because now a days it is the most popular social media even people with no computer knowledge uses Facebook in my country. The best point is that after sending your message you can also
                    <strong>
                        receive amazing replies from receiver
                    </strong>
                    . Through this you can convey your message to people and know what they think about different things. Also it can help children secretly ask their parents and know what are their reactions on different topics and react according to that next time.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ask Secretly is a web based
                    <strong>
                        Facebook app
                    </strong>
                    that can run on Facebook.com as an app. So its much easier for users. I have used
                    <strong>
                        Facebook API
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        PHP5+
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        Javascript
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        HTML/CSS
                    </strong>
                    and a bit of
                    <strong>
                        my hands
                    </strong>
                    :) . I have uploaded this app to my Linux hosting which supports this app easily. Made in 14- 15 days it is extremely easy to use and user friendly. My app is not yet verified by Facebook but i have applied for it 2 weeks before. Waiting for the results of this app.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was working in PHP before this but i chose to make this app totally in Javascript other than server side. I have used Facebook Javascript SDK. It was a bit confusing for me to use and connect Facebook API but at the end i was able to learn so many things and i learned how
                    <strong>
                        API's work
                    </strong>
                    and what is graph API that Facebook introduced. It was really amazing accomplishment for me.

                <h2>

                <p>
                    I have learned lots of things as mentioned above first of all i learned how you
                    <strong>
                        integrate your code and apps with big platforms
                    </strong>
                    and how you talk to these platforms using API's. I am more towards senior in Javascript because i really learned new functions and i have used
                    <strong>
                        DOM manipulation
                    </strong>
                    which was great. And i learned that
                    <strong>
                        when you code you really do enjoy
                    </strong>

                <p>
                    I am determined to make an android app for this but with a
                    <strong>
                        wonderful functionality
                    </strong>
                    . I am going to use
                    <strong>
                        WIFI DIRECT
                    </strong>
                    to connect two users with each other. Once both users have installed the app, now without doing anything the app will wait for the user to come in range of WIFI if any buddy comes in range of the WIFI the WIFI DIRECT will automatically connect to it and send a notification that some buddy is in range of you. Do you want to say something to them and its also
                    <strong>
                        connected with Facebook
                    </strong>
                    if other person clicks connect they will be able to chat and meet if they want.
