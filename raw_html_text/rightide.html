                    We all have friends who surf, and hearing that they were struggling to find a concise spot to check all the data they wanted to know about a beaches conditions. We wanted to provide that spot and make something accessible for new surfers by using an API to provide an assessment of the conditions instead of just numerical values that may be difficult to interpret. We are all extremely new to web development and to have assembled what we did in such a short time frame is an immense accomplishment. We have all learned a lot about Javascript, Css and html as well as teamwork and project management skills. We plan on working to improve and refine RighTide in the future to make it even better.
