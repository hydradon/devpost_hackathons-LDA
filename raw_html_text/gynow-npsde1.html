                    What makes Gynow special?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gynow is a user interactive app that allows users to be anonymous. It caters towards women who are looking for specific types of healthcare, and it tells users what they can find for immediate attention. It also provides a safe space in which women can read ratings from people who have had similar experiences and intentions as them. This builds a community of trust, empowerment, support, and health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gynow is a web app that links users to nearby healthcare centers such as OBGYNs and treatment centers. Users are able to interact with a map that has hearts to mark healthcare centers in their area. They can click on a heart (representing a healthcare center) to find out details of the facility, including address, distance, contact information, and hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that currently, our healthcare center data is hardcoded and displays how our application would look if the user were to search using their currect location (at USC). All of the hearts representing healthcare centers are centered around this region. Ultimately, we would like to make this searchable for all regions in the US.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gynow is built on a node.JS web application, which uses the Azure Web API to get locations. It is also deployed to the Microsoft Azure Web Services. In this version, the dataset contains information for ~10 real hard-coded centers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major challenge we encountered was with running the web application on each of our local machines. The project would appear differently depending on the browser and size of the window. We determined that we needed to debug the project by using a web service that uses a server instead of running it locally. This made it difficult for debugging because loading changes on GitHub source could take several minutes. We realized that by clearing our cache, restarting out browsers, and using incognito browser mode, we could accelerate the debug process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A challenge we had with the code itself came in the Layers of the Web SDK. In particular, the SymbolLayer and the BubbleLayers were undefined. Through extensive testing, we adjusted the variables in the code and were able to determine the factors that caused this issue. We had a few other issues in retrieving the health center times in a formatted string, displaying the popup when clicking, and initializing the map to the user's initial location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of creating our first web application together and using Azure for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This has been our entire team's first exposure to using Azure as a tool for API integration. We integrated the SimpleStoreLocator Azure Maps feature in order to bring our vision to life. We also implemented a significant amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was half of our group's first experience creating a web application, both front-end and back-end, so they had the chance to see how these elements come together to produce an entire application. Our team looks forward to using these new skills and appreciates the opportunity to work with the Microsoft Azure platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gynow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next part would be using an API to retrieve current data for health centers, instead of using the hard-coded data. In this API, Gynow would also use a popup to display the specialists, insurance, and directions of each health center in a x-mile radius (radius size customizable by the user). Additional features that we were unable to complete within the time limit, including mapping directions to each health center, linking to a safe transportation service app, connecting users to specialists, producing an anonymous reviews section for each center, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app be linked to transportation services for users to find the quickest, cheapest, and safest ways to reach the care they need. We understand that not everyone is able to afford personal rides to their destination, so we want to offer alternative public transportation routes to healthcare centers. The intuition behind this is wanting to make this kind of healthcare more accessible to people of all income brackets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we expand our project, we would like to add a homepage with options to connect with specialists, learn more about Gynow, and navigate to the map page. Our homepage would look like the picture above.
