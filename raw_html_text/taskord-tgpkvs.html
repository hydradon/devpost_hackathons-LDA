                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Discord is being used by clubs and groups more and more each day and it's hard to see why not. Discord provides a great platform for discussions for both text and voice alike. While conversing with a fellow club member or classmate is nice, organizing tasks for club events still needed to be done outside of discord. We sought out to fix this with our bot taskord.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taskord allows you to add a bot to your discord server that will create a task channel and keep it updated as tasks are updated. With a simple command, you can add an event a deadline and the user that is to be reminded about the event. With notification options, you can set how soon before an event you want the bot to dm the user reminding them about the event.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the bot itself in kotlin while running a mysql server for a backend.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges getting the API to do exactly what we wanted it to do.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how far we got considering our team size
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prior to this project one of us had no kotlin experience since then they've learned so much about the language and its quirks. We also learned about the discord API and how API's are not always as easy to use as you might think
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for taskord
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we look to improve functionality and solidify performance as well as add options for customed sized events
