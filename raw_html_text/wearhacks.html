                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SynWave is deeply rooted in bringing contemporary technology and meshing it within the current healthcare system, effectively bridging the gap between health and technology, but primarily to help in curbing prescription medication errors. Millions of deaths occur annually from incorrect prescriptions from improper user inputs or misinterpreting, SynWave informs patients regarding prescription medications while preventing avoidable incidents by detecting early warnings due to medication problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SynWave is a mobile application accompanied by the Muse headband to prevent medication prescription error from the patient's side. It gives tips and recommendations to users prior to the ingestion of medications, while monitoring brain waves using a headband that can sense brainwaves and facial muscle movements. Users can control the app with the headband, using head movements, blinking, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While prevention is important, in the event that an adverse reaction still happens, SynWave can warn its users by picking up abnormal symptoms in the patients brainwaves before physical symptoms appear. It is done by comparing the patient's current and the previously captured data to warn him/her to avoid what could be a fatal incident.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the test file from Muse's SDK and built our app on top of it. The bulk of it is in java and xml.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We quickly ran into errors with software compatibility, between current IDEs and the provided SDKs. After a few hours of updating and getting the SDKs to open properly, we ran into the challenge of getting the hardware to work with the system, identifying what exactly is the information we need to extract from it. Near the end of the hackathon, the Muse headband was not working properly since it always get disconnected from phones/computers. Thus, we weren't able to correctly test our application.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since none of our members have previous android development experience, we all learn how to use Android Studio. It is also our first time working with hardware like Muse, thus we learned to extract data from the wearable and interpreting it.

                <p>
                    We are still not done with the implementation of the "blink twice to go to the next page" part since we encountered difficulties with the hardware near the end of the hackathon.
