                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Current approach to atmospheric entry has been direct and short, causing the need for spacecrafts to have shield against high heat and creating unsafe environment for the astronauts and equipment. I want to experiment on an alternative entry without causing such harm to the spacecraft and anything in it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A new entry approach and spacecraft design was proposed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By doing research on how people have approached the problem. I know that a rock can be thrown to skip the water, if so the concept can be applied to entry, as entering from vacuum into air is like entering from air into water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No known experiments on whether an object can "skip" across the air surface and if yes, what the optimal parameters are. I have not designed a spacecraft before.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is feasible to be experimented and implemented. The applications of this project are wide and grand.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some aerodynamics concepts. Current implementation of planets entry in the world.

                <p>
