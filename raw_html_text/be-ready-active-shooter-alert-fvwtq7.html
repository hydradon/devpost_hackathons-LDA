                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shootings in schools and offices are on the rise. Schools and offices&rsquo; generally provide training on how to handle an active shooter, however, at such moment people may go into shock and may forget the training they received. Having an app on hand significantly eases the alert relay for people located on site.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Be Ready is a useful tool for alerting you to urgent events via notifications. It keeps you updated with real-time locations of emergencies happening at the moment near you.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Java, Google Map API, and Firebase
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Notifying users even if the app is not opened is challenging. We also had a tough time improving the visualization of the location data on the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we got the app working without any of us having previous experience with Android development. It was tough, but we enjoyed it a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
