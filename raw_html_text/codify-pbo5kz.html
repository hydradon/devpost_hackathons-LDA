                <p>
                    The whiteboard or chalkboard is an essential tool in instructional settings - to learn better, students need a way to directly transport code from a non-text medium to a more workable environment.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the front end, we built an app using Ionic/Cordova so the user could take a picture of their code. Behind the scenes, using JavaScript, our software harnesses the power of the Google Cloud Vision API to perform intelligent character recognition (ICR) of handwritten words. Following that, we applied our own formatting algorithms to prettify the code. Finally, our server sends the formatted code to the desired computer, which opens it with the appropriate file extension in your favorite IDE. In addition, the client handles all scripting of minimization and fileOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The vision API is trained on text with correct grammar and punctuation. This makes recognition of code quite difficult, especially indentation and camel case. We were able to overcome this issue with some clever algorithms. Also, despite a general lack of JavaScript knowledge, we were able to make good use of documentation to solve our issues.

                    A beautiful spacing algorithm that recursively categorizes lines into indentation levels.
Getting the app to talk to the main server to talk to the target computer.
Scripting the client to display final result in a matter of seconds.

                    What's next for Codify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's feasibly to increase accuracy by using the Levenshtein distance between words. In addition, we can improve algorithms to work well with code. Finally, we can add image preprocessing (heighten image contrast, rotate accordingly) to make it more readable to the vision API.
