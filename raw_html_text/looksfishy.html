                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came upon the idea of looksFishy after meticulously reading through the problem briefing and talking with several of the fishing experts in attendance at the hackathon.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    looksFishy is a mobile app that aims to reinvent the extraction of ghost gear by crowdsourcing an organized
movement. It incentivizes users to report and return lost gear for cash rewards.

                    Designing with photoshop and coding in Ruby on Rails and Ionic framework.

                <p>
                    We realized midway through that we needed to realign the priorities of the app in order to create more incentives for individuals to use it.
