                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I lost my purse which contained every important identification device, along with some bank cards. In the midst of my frustration, I continued to convince myself that the purse was in the house somewhere and would find it in no time. But I never did find it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For some people, their bags or wallets may contain even more sensitive information such as SSN or Passports. The time spent looking for a lost bag is enough time for a identity thief to steal your information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The purse is connected to an gps/gsm/sms module that can retrieve the location of your purse at any time and upload the information to a mongoldb server. The user can immediately retrieve location of his/her purse and determine whether to block immediately, beep, or blink.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built with Neo-6 Gsm module, connected to an Arduino that can proccess latitude and longitude.
Latitude and Longitude data is then passed to mongoldb server via stitch.
The tracking app is built with IOS Swift 4 and utilizes its various controllers, such as MapViewKit, touchId, etc
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had to stop for 2 hours (total 6 hr drive) due to car and phone troubles, thus arrived at 5:30, a little too lit to start. 
Soldering the leads of the gps module so that it could be connected to Arduino 
Restful API calls to the mongodb stitch server was no walk in the park
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I stuck through and created an app that works. The obscure lines of code that glues together the completely different types of technologies so that they all work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots about IOS: ViewControllers, MapKit View,making rest api calls ,layouts and MVC
Hardware: The technology behind cellular and gps communication
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully make the card much flatter by using smaller components
