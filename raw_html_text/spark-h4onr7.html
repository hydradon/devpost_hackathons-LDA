                <p>
                    Our three software engineers all have passions in different areas of the stack. One engineer focused on the Machine Learning model, one engineer built the server side and one engineer focused on UI, UX and front-end engineering. Our three product team members divided responsibilities as well. One acted as a product manager to interface with engineers and set priorities. The other two worked on the schema to be fed into our Machine Learning model and pricing calculation.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we were all really excited about the latest Google Cloud Platform technologies, we used several GCP Services that are new and don't yet a lot of documentation and blog posts across the the web. With the help of the Google support engineers present, we were able to integrate many of these services in unforeseen novel ways.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked with new services in Google Cloud that none of us had extensively worked with before.
