                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Demetri and I wanted to collaborate on a coding project that would allow for utilization of both our backgrounds. His background being in finance(trading), and mine being in computer science.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with a random stock price generator that would similarly mimic a real world stock price, and then came up with a algorithm that made decisions on whether to buy or sell within the randomly generated stock price for long term profits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Made stock pricing generator
2) Implement rules for buying and selling 
3) Calculating money gain or loss
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some group issues in the beginning, some of the members lost interest and then we had a 50/50 separation. After this, we then had to figure out how to properly implement probability into our number generator. Calculating when to buy and sell was also another issue we faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make a fairly reasonable model of the stock market. Also, within certain parameters the algorithm would generate profits automatically without human involvement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a random number generator using Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trading Algorithm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further uses of this trading algorithm would be to implement it to a certain stock API for real time stock pricing and connecting to real stock trading account to start real world trades.
