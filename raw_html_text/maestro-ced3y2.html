                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main concern was giving the ability to follow international news, and any other videos, to people with visual
disabilities. As we progressed, we've noticed that this could be used in fields like Education, International Affairs,
Entertainment, and Business.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Converting a mp3, or mp4 file's audio (dubbing) to desired language and embedding the translated audio in to the video in a higher pitch volume
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've built it by using Watson's Speak to Text, Text to Speak API, Google Translate API, SSML
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting the timestamps of each dialog, limits of the Watson's Bluemix API, new speaking speed of speaker

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dubbing a video as almost identical to it's original version
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before we have started the application we thought the only challenge would be on using APIs, but as we progressed
we have seen that was only the seen part of the iceberg. We faced countless issues about timestamp's of each dialog and we, once again, understood the importance of the planning phase of a project

                    Optimizing the timestamps, and rates which determines the speed of the dub
