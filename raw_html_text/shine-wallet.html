                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was having difficulty managing the many lightning wallets that I have, on different computers, running different implementations of lightning. I wanted to build an app that allows you to access your lightning wallet on any device no matter which lightning daemon you are running.

                <p>
                    Right now, Shine allows you to add wallets, view basic node info, view transactions, create invoices, and send payments. Shine currently supports LND &amp; C-Lightning via the Spark server proxy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By building on Blockstack, I was also able to take advantage of my encrypted personal storage (provided by Blockstack Gaia) so that I don't have to enter my lightning configurations more than once - a sign in to blockstack on whatever device will allow you to access your wallets with the same experience for each device.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I built it on top of blockstack, as a vuejs application.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were some things about LND that was challenging initially. gRPC is not an option currently in a web browser, so
                    <code>
                        http
                    </code>
                    commands were required. There was a bit of a different between the http commands and the gRPC commands, but the biggest headache is the fact that LND does not allow CORS (currently a github ticket here:
                    <a href="https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/2344" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/2344
                    </a>
                    ). The workaround is turning off the CORS security check in the browser. I also had to manually add the LND SSL cert to my browser's ignored list as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C-Lightning via Spark wasn't too bad, but there was some weird things about how spark handles parameters that I ended up having to do some work arounds with. Also, sometimes had to make two commands to get the same information that a single LND command would have given me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I'm really glad I was able to maintain feature parity between LND and C-Lightning so far. All in all, it wasn't too bad to work with either, and once I got the flow down, it was only an hour or two for adding each new command for both daemons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about LND and C-Lightning commands, and solidifying my knowledge even more so I don't have to reference commands/flows to do basic lightning things.
                </p>

                    What's next for Shine Wallet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will be continuing to add more commands for both LND and C-Lightning. Once all the basics (like opening/closing channels, etc.) are at a good place, I will attempt to add more implementations. I believe acinq, casa, and raspberry pie's have different implementations but I would have to look into it.
