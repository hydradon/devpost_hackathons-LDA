                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we live in a virtually hyper-connected world, sometimes we loose the
                    <em>
                        human touch
                    </em>
                    . Everyone has heard older generations explain how the world was before the internet arrived and how all the values have evolved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, what is stopping us from enabling people get in touch,
                    <em>
                        face to face
                    </em>
                    , with the help of technology? There are already some successful solutions, but we believed we could go a step further. Imagine you are representing your company at a conference: this app could help you know the other attendees and create solid professional relationships.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a nutshell, our project allows anyone to access someone else's data by just taking a picture, and so making it easier to engage in a conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our focus during the HackUPC has been on developing an API where everyone can publish their images and add personal information, which could include the name, hobbies, a description, Twitter username, etc. Although the endpoint to add this information has not been created, we have added this information manually on the database. This way, by sending an image to the API, an algorithm recognizes the person and returns their information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With our Android showcase app we have tried to show a basic example. It allows users to take and send images and get the information from the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the frontnend side we have developed and Android app that allows the user to scan people faces in order to get his name, hobbies, etc. The app is built using Android Studio and Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the backend side we have depeloped an API that connects the Android device to Microsoft Face Recognition system and our user DB. The system is developed using Node js with Typescript, built on top of docker containers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In many futuristic movies, people walk around with digital goggles that display people's name on real time next to that person face. One of our objectives was to build an app that would simulate this feeling, but because of the lack of time and resources, the app is quite basic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completed our objectives and we've made a prototype of the app with real functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Search You
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a world driven by data, we believe that having all the information of every registered user could allow us to predict compatibility between people. This way, one could find highly similar people
