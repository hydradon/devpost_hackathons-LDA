                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UPS and Amazon have their drone delivery program, but there is very little information on their process. So we've decided to create our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can fly to the inputted GPS coordinates and deliver packages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used DJI's OSDK protocol in Ubuntu Linux running on Nvidia TX2 onboard computer to send commands to the flight controller (DJI N3).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're not familiar with C++, however, we have experience in C# so we figured it out.
We have never set up a local server using the https protocol, it took a while to get it working so that we can send the GPS coordinates to the drone via the web-based interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have figured out communication using the DJI's SDK protocol (OSDK)
We have made a web-based interactive map that can be used to easily upload waypoints to the drone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned how to work with the SDK protocol. We have improved our ability to work as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Autonomous Drone Delivery System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be integrating a QR recognition program into the code. Allowing the drone to land autonomously with much greater precision than what is possible with GPS. We have found and fixed a program that tracks a QR code in real-time. It will be integrated with the existing program.
