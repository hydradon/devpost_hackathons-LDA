                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found the fortnite API and thought it would be great to make use of it. I'm a fan of the game but far from an addict, unlike some people I work with, so I could see that people would love to know whats in the shop without having to boot up their computer and load up the game. There are phone apps doing it already but no Alexa App is as fully featured as this one nor uses the APL to actually show you what's in the stores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows you the daily fortnite shop and it can show you upcoming items, both filterable by item type.
It can also show you challenges by the week, and it can suggest locations for you to drop on the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it testing locally with lambda-local in vscode and deploying with the ask cli. I generated the initial project with ask-cli and I generated the template with the alexa developer console template editor with some slight tweaks to the generated json. I then tested with the alexa developer console Test area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Debugging the code locally, as using the Test method and console.logs in the aws lambda area was tedious and having to re-upload node_modules when adding packages was a huge slowdown. That was how I operated before but it was putting me off writing for alexa so I looked around and found my new setup with lambda-local in vscode and ask cli.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting my environment set up. I'll be able to make a new app in less than half the time now! Also, the finished product I think looks very nice, it was a bit tricky to make changes to the templates but the default sample templates were a great looking starting point.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned quite a bit! I learned how to debug aws lambda functions locally using lambda-local. How to use the ask cli. I learned how to use the Alexa APL. I improved my knowledge of require and request libs for node.js. Not to mention learning about using the multimodal templates and their datasources.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'd like to make more use of the great API. News updates, and weapons information.
Also maybe a tweet feed from EPIC and popular streamers.
