                    This program looks at a picture of a face and reads the emotion.
It then suggests music according to the user's emotion. We utilize Clarfifai's API to
develop this program. The program first scans the picture using Clarifai's original 
10,000+ tags and if the image fits one of the tags in focus, the program starts suggesting
music. If however, the tags did not match, the program will send a request to another set custom
trained tags, that we implemented in Clarifai's python's API.

                    Still Need
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We very much still need to add more training cases, and more music to our list (which can be added very easily, we just really need to sleep now :).
