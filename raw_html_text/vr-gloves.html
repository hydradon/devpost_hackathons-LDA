                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ordered a pair of VR gloves on kick-starter about 2.5 years ago and I have still not received them. I wanted to make my own to see how hard it was, and it seemed like fun.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracks your fingers and palm's orientation in 3d space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of proper resources, inadequate documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got it to work somewhat. With some more refinement, they should be fairly good. Also, we made a Donkey Kong game.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While it was harder than I expected, I still feel that If 4 college students can make this much progress in under 36 hours with a lack of good resources and sleep, than the company I ordered my gloves from has no excuses.

                <p>
                    Make them more reliable, less bulky.
