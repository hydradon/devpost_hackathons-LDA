                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enhanced an idea from a school project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Forks and runs commands inside a Unix environment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C, a text editor, and GCC. Utilizes linked list and structs for history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was very unfamiliar with C and low level languages in general, so it was sometimes challenging to implement even basic functionality that I used to take for granted, such as some more advanced string comparison.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I haven't had a segmentation fault in a very long time when running (those were very common in debugging and took a while to hunt down)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C, unix commands that I never would have used otherwise
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sfotm Shell
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Persistent history, maybe some other cool stuff
                </p>
