                        It was 12:30 in the morning

                    . After spending half a day installing and configuring a react.js application we learned the platform was incompatible with the

                    and our plan for a meditation app had been made obsolete.

                    </em>
                    , in a moment of sprited conversation we came up with the idea of a tool to share resumes based on geofencing.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    MacWatt uses geofences to share job seekers resumes with nearby employers. When a user enters the geofence of an employer their resume is automatically shared with that employer, allowing them to gain job opportunities on the go.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MacWatt hosts the resumes of users on Firebase, the files are transmitted via node.js and the front end is controlled through a mix of bootstrap, jQuery, and Angular.js.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the time constraint of our new project we found ourselves stressed to meet all of our goals. Half of our team had to leave in the morning due to other commitments and we found ourselves racing against the clock. In the end we completed the front end but it came at the cost of our back end. Unfortunately, Geofencing code was not finished in time and thus could not be integrated into the front end in time to present.

                <p>
                    Completing a minimalistic front end design that allows for employers to easily browse resumes of nearby job seekers.

                <p>
                    One of the best things about hackathons is diving in headfirst with no prior experience with certain technologies. That being said this approach should be taken with a hint of moderation. A diversified skilled set among team mates combined with a reasonable degree of new technology is required for optimal personal growth.

                <p>
                    The future for MacWatt lies in completing our back end development and thus producing a complete service to connect employers to aspiring job seekers.
