                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love Zachtronics games. And hence, I decided to try my hand at making a game based off of programming!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game where you execute custom Inject.ion commands to traverse a network and alter data and your store to complete a given task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and CoffeeScript initially, as I wanted to use this as a way to learn CS. I used jQuery (because what web project doesn't have jQuery) as well as Canvas to draw the actual network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built the structure of the view first, then built the model. I knew the view would have a textarea to write code, and a button to run it. After that, I started simultaneous work on the model and controller. I built the InjectionRunner, Node, and command dictionary in tandem. I created the dictionary initially to only house three commands: "inject", "return", and "set". As my program evolved though, I realized that there were many more I could do. I created mathy methods and loops much later in the competition. Wrangling with Canvas was a bit difficult, and I had to use a piece of paper to do some basic trig, but I managed to get a somewhat nice display of a network going. After that, I decided to put my network diagrams in JSON files, and load them into the CS. This way, levels can be modular, and switched to and from easily. After that, I needed to generate a win condition for levels, and check on running whether that condition was met. There were many various other changes; using pink as a color scheme (a happy accident by randomly tinting the device icons), the creation of a manual, three more buttons, a level description addition, and a lot more.

                <p>
                    It was a fantastic refresher on Canvas and jQuery, and I learned quite a bit of CoffeeScript as well! I'll definitely, strongly consider CS for my next project.

                    What's next for Inject.ion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely syntax checking and infinite loop prevention. After that, who knows? Graphics updates, larger breadth of commands, more types of devices, there is so much more that Inject.ion can be!
