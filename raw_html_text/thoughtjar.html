                    Thought Jar poses thought provoking questions for the user who wants to practice critical thinking and an intentional interaction with technology. Users can choose to type a response to the randomized prompt, simply acknowledge that they thought about it, or request a new prompt. Additional features include viewing previous responses and changing the background color. This app offers an interesting and impactful alternative to less engaging mobile applications.
Thought Jar aims to foster broader conversations for inclusivity and empowerment in society by first encouraging independent, critical thinking.

                    Configuring Packager IP Address
                </h3>
                <p>
                    When starting your project, you'll see something like this for your project URL:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>exp://192.168.0.2:19000
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The "manifest" at that URL tells the Expo app how to retrieve and load your app's JavaScript bundle, so even if you load it in the app via a URL like
                    <code>
                        exp://localhost:19000
                    </code>
                    , the Expo client app will still try to retrieve your app at the IP address that the start script provides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some cases, this is less than ideal. This might be the case if you need to run your project inside of a virtual machine and you have to access the packager via a different IP address than the one which prints by default. In order to override the IP address or hostname that is detected by Create React Native App, you can specify your own hostname via the
                    <code>
                        REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME
                    </code>
                    environment variable:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mac and Linux:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME='my-custom-ip-address-or-hostname' npm start
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Windows:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>set REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME='my-custom-ip-address-or-hostname'
npm start
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    The above example would cause the development server to listen on
                    <code>
                        exp://my-custom-ip-address-or-hostname:19000

                    Create React Native App does a lot of work to make app setup and development simple and straightforward, but it's very difficult to do the same for deploying to Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store without relying on a hosted service.

                <p>
                    Expo provides free hosting for the JS-only apps created by CRNA, allowing you to share your app through the Expo client app. This requires registration for an Expo account.

                <p>
                    If you want to build and deploy your app yourself, you'll need to eject from CRNA and use Xcode and Android Studio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is usually as simple as running

                        npm run eject
                    </code>

                    If you're unable to load your app on your phone due to a network timeout or a refused connection, a good first step is to verify that your phone and computer are on the same network and that they can reach each other. Create React Native App needs access to ports 19000 and 19001 so ensure that your network and firewall settings allow access from your device to your computer on both of these ports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try opening a web browser on your phone and opening the URL that the packager script prints, replacing
                    <code>
                        exp://
                    </code>
                    with

                    </code>
                    . So, for example, if underneath the QR code in your terminal you see:
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>exp://192.168.0.1:19000
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Try opening Safari or Chrome on your phone and loading
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>http://192.168.0.1:19000
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    and
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>http://192.168.0.1:19001
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    If this works, but you're still unable to load your app by scanning the QR code, please open an issue on the

                    URL in your phone's web browser, try using the tethering/mobile hotspot feature on your phone (beware of data usage, though), connecting your computer to that WiFi network, and restarting the packager. If you are using a VPN you may need to disable it.

                    <li>
                        Make sure Xcode is installed and open it to accept the license agreement if it prompts you. You can install it from the Mac App Store.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Open Xcode's Preferences, the Locations tab, and make sure that the
                        <code>
                            Command Line Tools
                        </code>
                        menu option is set to something. Sometimes when the CLI tools are first installed by Homebrew this option is left blank, which can prevent Apple utilities from finding the simulator. Make sure to re-run
                        <code>
                            npm/yarn run ios

                    <li>
                        If that doesn't work, open the Simulator, and under the app menu select
                        <code>
                            Reset Contents and Settings...

                    If you're not able to scan the QR code, make sure your phone's camera is focusing correctly, and also make sure that the contrast on the two colors in your terminal is high enough. For example, WebStorm's default themes may

                </p>
                <p>
                    If this causes problems for you, you may want to try changing your terminal's color theme to have more contrast, or running Create React Native App from a different terminal. You can also manually enter the URL printed by the packager script in the Expo app's search bar to load it manually.
