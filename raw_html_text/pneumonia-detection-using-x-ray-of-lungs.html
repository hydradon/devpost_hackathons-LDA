                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A person who wants to check for any signs of lung diseases will generally have to book an appointment at the x-ray lab followed by the doctor and then based on the doctors judgement of the X-ray know the condition of his/her health. What if there was an intermediate step which could tell the person whether an appointment with the doctor is necessary. This is made possible by our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our project the x ray of the patients lung is provided to a ML Based Algorithm which is trained over a set of images having a normal lung and set of lungs displaying signs of pneumonia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used CNN to build train the machine. We used a data set from Kaggle which contained the test cases as well as the training data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The trained machine could either predict the lungs with pneumonia with an almost perfect accuracy or could predict the lungs without pneumonia with an almost perfect accuracy. It was a challenge to get these two in a perfect sync. It was a challenge to get the front end working too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got an accuracy of 78% while training the machine for both pneumonia lungs and normal lungs. While training the machine just for the pneumonia lungs, we got an accuracy of 97%.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about CNN as well as designing a front end using Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pneumonia detection using x-ray of lungs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As there are types of pneumonia, we can train the machine to detect the types. We can also try to train the machine in such a way such that we can increase the accuracy of both pneumonia and normal lungs.
