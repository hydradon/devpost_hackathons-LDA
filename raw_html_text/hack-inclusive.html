                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personally, I love Hackathons. I love tackling a challenge faced by my community and solving. Unfortunately, I only know few places that keep updates information on upcoming hackathons and not all of them are as inclusive as I'd like them to be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finds Hackathons in your area, that are inclusive to everyone (but a feature for certain groups will be added), and gives resources to help you begin thinking of ideas and learning basic CS concepts without much jumping around to page to page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML, CSS. Was Planning to include PHP and JavaScript but I was finding out of time to get it all functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had trouble trying to figure out APIs for the map feature, but I'm hoping to tackle that task soon. For now, a static image will take it's place and a list will appear of the locations instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a problem and learning how to solve it - Hackathons should be easy to find for everyone no matter who they are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that nothing is made over night and if I want this to be made a reality, I would need help from others and take my time to perfect the page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hack Inclusive
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next is a mobile app for easy searching and more mini games
