                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mafia is a great way to meet new friends, however we found that having a human moderator caused issues from time to time. That person didn't get to play with the rest of the group, they occasionally made errors in counting, and the logistics of the game could be quite messy. Aiming to solve these issues, we hope to make an app that can automate Mafia moderation.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app attempts to simulate the creation and moderation of a Mafia game.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using Android Studio and Google Play Services to handle networking components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our largest challenge was understanding the workings behind the Google Play Services API. We also ran into issues with designing the game logic that would process the turns, while maintaining a synced state with our shared data between app clients.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are particularly proud about how simple it is for the users to create and join a game instance of our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a game that shares a state between several users, and we learned how to tie networking components into Google Play.
                </p>

                    What's next for Mobile Mafia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to spend time polishing our user interface to make it more streamlined and obvious for the uninitiated user. We want to make our game work through several cycles. We also hope to add more achievements to our game.
