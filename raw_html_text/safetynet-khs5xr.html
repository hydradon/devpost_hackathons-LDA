                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To lower the barrier to connect for both people in need and organizations providing assistance in real time. Utilize immediate data sharing, as well as, crowd sourcing to prevent homelessness by assistance and minimize delays of service.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Addressing emergency shelter by lowering the barrier for those in need as well as those who can help with real time data sharing allowing for crowd sourced prevention and mitigation.

                    We believe that we need to allow for many ways to have some one in need to ask for help.  Some one in need can call or text us at (314) 310-0135 or you can register for help at

                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe the more ways we allow for people to reach out for help the more people we can help.   We allow for the individuals that need help to see what they can do to help themselves. We also enable people all over the world to help connect people in need to services that can help them.  We believe that using the engine of crowdsourcing we can quickly and easily get help for everyone in need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also believe that there are many people and organizations that want to help but do not know how to advertise and connect with the people that need the help.  Our easy registration allows for people in need to get quick knowledge of who wants to help and how these organizations can help them.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our UI with Angular and Bootstrap. Our API is built with Spring Boot running in containers served by Kubernetes. We are utilizing Twilio for phone interaction with our API.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was determining the best way for people in need to interact with our system.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned of the extensive challenges that care providers are faced with everyday in their pursuit of helping people in need.

                    What's next for SafetyNet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to add a more involved registration to streamline the HUD data entry.  Ideally some one could go through our web ui and we could fill in and share the data across centers.
