                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that would make the city more intelligent by enabling people to give data they have access to everyday at everytime of their life, more easily both for the concerned organizations and the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What a big incident is happening, such as a fire, a car accident or any other catastrophe, people that have our app can signal the situation simply by taking a picture of what they witness with the name of it and an optional description of what they see. Obviously, to make sure we get reliable information from the people using our application, every single image sent to our server is analysed using a computer program that has been trained with machine-learning to identify the content of the image. For example, if someone takes a picture of a fire, the image will be analysed to be sure that it's actually a fire. Then, all reported catastrophes will be accessible to the the concerned authorities, faster than never before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using many different technologies. The application has been created with Android Studio as the computer program that analyse the images has been created with TensorFlow and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facing bugs in our IDE's has definetely been one of our biggest challenges, but also connecting the different parts of our project with different technologies.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our user interface, our vision recognition program based on machine-learning and the fact we've been able to link all this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely learned more about creating apps in group project context, but also definetely improved our programming skills.
                </p>

                    What's next for UReport
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't know if it's gonna have a sequel, but who knows! Maybe if we have the time one day, we'll try to make this app presented to the interested authorities.
