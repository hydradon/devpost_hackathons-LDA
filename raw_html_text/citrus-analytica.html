As a group of loyal followers to /r/dataisbeautiful, we took advantage of the opportunity to analyze ourselves.

                                The first theme we tried with Webpack was glitchy and scrolling did not work. When attempting to plot multiple charts on a single page, the offset was not handled correctly, and visually was not usable. After about an hour of trying various (hokey) workarounds, we scrapped the theme and now use the current one.

                        Jerry is a Map/Reduce legend.

                        Will eats Node for breakfast after it eats him.

                    <li>
                        Justin figured out routing for Angular (even though we didn't use it).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Audrey can shotgun chart ideas faster than Will can say, "MongoDB is a very good non-relational database."

                        Sunk cost. Sometimes it's easier to start over than force a glitchy old thing to work.

                        Having a server at your disposal is very liberating. (But Will knew that already.)

                    <li>
                        Mapping out ideas (flowcharts, lists, etc.) during the planning process is a
