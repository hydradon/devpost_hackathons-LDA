                    Inspiration:
One of the biggest culture at UCR is the "freshmen 15" transformation, which means they gain about 15 lbs after they go through their first year living in the dorm. This is mainly due to the all you can eat Dinning Halls as well as lack of measurement of food portion. This is why we want to build a web app that would give students a better knowledge of how much they can eat per day to stay "fit"!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does:
First, the program will ask the user if they are "Expert" (meaning they have a good understanding of their diet, and daily calories goal). If users pick this opinion, then they would be able to input their daily calories goal, the number of meals per day, and macro distribution (percent of fat, protein, and carbohydrate they would like to consume per day). Based on the information that the user provided, we will search through both Dining Halls at UCR (AI and Lothian Dining Halls) and return the suggesting meal plan for the day for both locations (AI and Lothian), in which they can choose which to follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for people that are not sure about their daily calories goal or their macro distribution, they would be able to pick the "Beginner" opinion (they will input the number of meals per day, their weight/height/age/gender/daily activity levels, which we would use to calculate their TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure). They would also input their goal (lose/maintain/gain weight). Based off those two choices, we would be able to suggest their daily calorie goal). Based on the calculations, we will search through both Dining Halls at UCR (AI and Lothian Dining Halls) and return the suggesting meal plan for the day for both locations (AI and Lothian), in which they can choose which to follow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it:
Using Javascript to scrap information online and pass into MySQL database. We use React for the front-end and javascript to get user input to create their personal meal plan. We also use SendGrid api to send out their customize a meal plan to the user's email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for ALaCarte:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Be able to offer different combinations of meal plans (for example if the student would like to go to Dining Hall 1 for breakfast, Dining Hall 2 for lunch, and Dining Hall 1 for dinner) that will help them keep their calories in check.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Build a user database that stores user information, so they would not have to input every time they want to see what their meal plans look like for the day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Expand it outside of school dining halls, which would allow users to input their desired choice of restaurant/fast food chains, and we would be able to provide a customized meal plan based on their choice of stores.
