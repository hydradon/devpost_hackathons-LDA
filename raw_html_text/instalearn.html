                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm obsessed with optimizing learning efficiency, and short videos are by far my favorite medium of information! My target audience is young children and the elderly- people who probably do not read very much, or who might not be able to make full use of the internet to learn anything they want. This makes learning easier for them (and more efficient for the rest of us)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You type in anything you want to learn, and it generates an audio summary and relevant pictures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the python Wikipedia library to quickly obtain interesting summaries and pictures, and the google cloud text-to-speech api to generate the audio files.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generating the actual video takes too long :(

                    Proof of concept works! Bite sized audio-visual information? Check!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was my first time working with the google cloud api. That was pretty cool!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for InstaLearn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm excited to look beyond Wikipedia to generate more interesting summaries from the most credible sources. I'd also like to customize the language used based on the user's age (if I really want to make learning more accessible to kids, I'll need to ensure the vocabulary doesn't put them off!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    A speech-to-text feature would be great in increasing my reach to people who can't read or write. Finally, I look forward to implementing this in an app so that anyone can learn anything, anywhere!
