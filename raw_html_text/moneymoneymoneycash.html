                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Suffering from ATM fees, searching for places with cashback, and traveling far distances to escape fees is a hassle we'd rather be without.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can search for people in your area who are willing to give cash of a specified amount.  In exchange, the venmo API is used to pay the account of that person.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node, mongodb, and angular to build our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never used mongodb and wanted to give it a try.  It caused a lot of errors we weren't used to and we had to relearn a lot of things on the fly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a website that does stuff!  While we weren't able to integrate all of the ideas that we had, we have a working version of a scaled down version.  Our framework is solid, so we can easily expand this project in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is better to lay a solid and well-organized structure to rely on when sleep-deprivation sets in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for moneymoneymoneycash
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to successfully integrate with the venmo API through OAuth so that we can successfully send money between users.  We'd also like an in-app messaging system so users can better coordinate a meeting system.
