                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There many different e-scooter companies active in San Antonio, each with a different proprietary app. Rowdy Scoot aims to aggregate all available scooters into one map view to make it easier to locate one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently shows Bird and Lime scooters. Allows the user to get directions comparing the speed of walking to a destination versus detouring to grab a scooter for the trip.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript, Mapbox &amp; Mapbox Directions API, Domain.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bird and Lime do not provide public API to retrieve scooter locations. We had to rely on reverse engineered documentation for this. We would need to seek permission to use these APIs before moving further with this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got it working enough to serve a practical purpose
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons are pretty cool but I think we're all about to pass out from exhaustion
                </p>

                    What's next for Rowdy Scoot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Needs support for more scooter brands and a whole lot of polish
                </p>
