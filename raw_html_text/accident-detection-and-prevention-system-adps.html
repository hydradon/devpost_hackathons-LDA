                    Number of cars have increased in the past 10 years, and hence the accidents rate has also drastically increased. Our  idea is to avoid accidents as much as possible and assist the driver with some essential information
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our product detects "speed limit" signs, "stop signs" on the road. Some times drivers will not see the signs properly. So if they go in a speed of 70mph in an area which has a limit of 40 mph, then accidents can occur easily. So our application assists the driver to find the current speed limit of the road. It also detects the accidents and reports on the accidents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used python scripts to emulate the process. The script runs in the raspberry pi. It takes snapshots every second and analyzes the image for stop sign and speed limit sign. This can be extended for any sign. We also have a vibration sensor which is used to detect an accident. If an accident is detected then the accident information is sent to near by hospitals and also to registered people. We used APIs like Cisco Spark, Microsoft Cognitive services, Google APIs and MapQuest APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To detect the speed limit sign it was little difficult because we didnot had the sign with us. We did not get a camera to interface with the raspberry pi and have simulated the same in the laptop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud about the fact that we have contributed an application that assists drivers to avoid accidents and save potential lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot through out the process. We learned how to use Microsoft Cognitive services and also MapQuest API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next our idea is to get a good camera and research about the accuracy.
