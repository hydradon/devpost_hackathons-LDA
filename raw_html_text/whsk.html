                <p>
                    The smart-home cooking machine that uses algorithms to predict the cooking time, and goes through every step of the cooking process until your meal is ready. The best part is that it does everything without your supervision. The machine is connected to the app that also uses algorithms to smartly come up with all possible healthy recipes to cook, based on the type and amount of groceries you have in your fridge.

                <p>
                    Limited time to come up with an idea and develop it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our design and user experience

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Figma framework in order to create user interfaces for mobile apps. Also, we deepened our knowledge in Indesign and Pop to create prototypes to test our app without coding it and fixing all the time.

                <p>
                    Worl-wide recognition. WHSK will revolutionize the way people eat, cook and consume food. By introducing WHSK app and smart-home machine people will save both time and money and, more importantly, will have a much healthier diet without a need of spending a lot of time to prepare their meals.
Also, we are planning on pitching our business and technological idea on the famous American TV show Shark Tank to get further funding and support from real-life experts and elevate WHSK to the world market.
