                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have been passionate about mental health stigma and the quest for constant improvement. My experiences with friends, martial arts and journey as a developer has helped open my eyes and see that almost everyone in the world is climibing a mountain. Some live for it, some find peace and settle somewhere, and some are just afraid to go. Even I would stay in comfort zones because instead of climbing and changing for the better I would improve in simply more of the same. Like I was playing checkers because I was afraid of chess. My mentor had similar experiences a long time ago and so here I am now.

                <p>
                    I am a solid mobile developer and need to use my last 7 hours efficiently. I am using Swift

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm dealing with the standard bugs in Xcode, aside from that, curating content in a hackathaon is tricky because of large downloads on the network
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My first time coming to Bitcamp I was completely helpless. I relied on a senior who was a much better programmer and also relied on mentors the whole time. Here I am now solo and haven't asked for any help (nothing wrong with asking for help of course). Between that and how the theme this year fits exactly with Mountain I feel like everything is coming full circle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's been something I've been relearning and appreciating more and more: everyone has a craft, and mastery is the goal for any craftsman. I used to see things as a zero sum game, but now I see it it's all about the process and the constant improvement (my first dojo was called Kaizen MMA) and the Kaizen principle ( continuous change for the better) that the dojo takes it's name from is constantly on my mind again now that I'm back to my roots. I believe it can benefit anyone struggling mentally, physically, and spiritually.

                    What's next for Mountain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After Bitcamp I'm going to keep coding it and put it up on Testflight to get some insight from peers.
