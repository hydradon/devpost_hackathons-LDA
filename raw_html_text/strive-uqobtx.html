                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're a tightly knit group of friends from McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. As you could probably tell from our tech stack (built with "love" and "friendship"), we're a very supportive peer environment. This was the inspiration behind us creating Strive, an application that helps you achieve those goals by capitalizing on that community environment and competitive spirit.
                </p>

Utilizes computer vision to quickly track your meals and food intake, while providing you with nutritional information

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our front end was written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. We implemented our backend using Firebase and Node.JS to call the Google Cloud Vision API for real-time image processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our teammates were newer to the workflow process of version control, so it took us some time to get on the same page and begin coding together. In addition to this, there were some issues with uploading images via AJAX requests, which slowed down our implementation of the computer vision models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud to have built a robust and beautiful user interface, thanks to our team of frontend developers. We're also very proud of the fact that we were able to utilize the computer vision API and connect it to our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use jQuery and AJAX to request files and manipulate the DOM. We were also exposed to the debugging tools in VSCode for the first time, thanks to a lot of help from our mentors!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Strive
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really hope to be able to continue this project and implement it on a local scale. Creating a group to track our own fitness and nutritional goals was one of the primary goals for this project, and we believe it's a good start. Beyond that, we truly believe this could help those without strong peer environments and positive influences a good way to find like-minded peers who share their goals and aspirations.
