                    There are plenty of workout websites, but most just help you track what you already know. Now some sites give you strict workout regiment or give you general workouts for everyone.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app use a backend of node.js and was mostly built with React. Then the machine learning is processed and analyzed by a mix of DBscan clustering algorithm. The whole project is hosted using Compute Engine on GCP.
