                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to begin by acknowledging that our land has a deep history. We take time for "land acknowledgement" statements at many events. What would it take to learn what these really means?
We were inspired by our lack of understanding of the First Nations tribes and the land acknowledgement statements we repeatedly hear. Despite often hearing these statements, we acknowledged little understanding of the First Nations Tribes of Canada.

                    Our application makes this vital information
                    <em>
                        accessible
                    </em>
                    in a fun, interactive, and non-intrusive way. It is
                    <em>
                        inclusive
                    </em>
                    to the First Nations peoples and their history, and allows people to learn about their traditions and history in our city. Our app celebrates the
                    <em>
                        diversity
                    </em>
                    and culture that they bring to our current landscape.

                    Birds'eye uses location data and push notifications to alert a user when they are within a given distance of a historical landmark or area, as well as information about the landmark and the First Nations peoples.
