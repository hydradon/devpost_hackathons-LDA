                </h2>
                <p>
                    This will absolutely blow your mind! We created a ML model that learns from various characteristics about a business (Past Heaath Inspection Scores, location, 311 Calls in the nearby area, number of health inspection scores, and the number of health inspection violations) and decides whether it is more or less likely to fail its next health inspection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After deciding these things, it can return a list of the top 5 most likely to need a health inspection, for a health inspector to then use in picking what restaurants to inspect.
                </p>

                    The amount of money this product could save the city is so large we couldn't actually upload it due to the 50 mb upload rule! (Not actually but you get the picture!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is one smart model. We are very scared of its possibilities! Hence, The Intimidation Factor

                <p>
                    Turns out the data is very convoluted in its normal form so we had to format all of the data we used a lot to get it in a usable form.
