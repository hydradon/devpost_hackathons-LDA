                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Typically, the only way to get know other people in you major was if you shared a class with them. The amount of people you knew in your major was restricted to the one in your class rank. We wanted to change and broaden the connections we could make in our school.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product allows you to create a profile, inserting the skills, classes, and your major so it can connect you to people with similar data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this with Django and python as the back end. The front end was with Google's css framework, Materialize.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues syncing our work on github. Three different people trying to work on the same project made certain files corrupt in the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to set up the login and authentication system for the project. It stores the data and allows people to login and log out.
                </p>
                <h2>
