                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trends show that a lot of people are becoming increasing calorie-conscious and health-conscious than ever. They want  healthy and balanced diet with good nutrition values. Along with the growing interest, grows a market for health food. Such are the salad bars and bowl - based restaurants. While the markings on the bars have a calorie value, and general awareness of the people makes them know the nutrition in the food they are getting, they do not know the exact nutrition in the food they eat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our motivation is to build a robot, that will serve the right amount of the user's choice of food based on the nutrition values of the food according the user requirement.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For example, consider your are at a food court with the display of different foods. If you tell the robot that you want "500cals of vegan protein" it will bring you the food that matches your description. Such that a falafel plate.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a raspberry pi based robot.  For the hardware, we bought a robot kit from Uctronics, that included the obstacle avoidance pre-built.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We added the following additional functionalities:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Identification of food and go towards the food based on object recognition
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Based on the keras based training, the robot will identity the food that is on display.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        According to the ingredients, it will find out the calories and give the food some tags based on wor2vec such as for falafel the closes tags would be {vegan, protein}
                    </li>
                </ol>
