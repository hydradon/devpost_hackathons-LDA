                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was inspired to us from
                    <strong>
                        reddit
                    </strong>
                    to which we added the
                    <strong>
                        location-based
                    </strong>
                    system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AroundU allows the user to submit posts like comments, pictures or videos, based on their location. These posts will stick to that location so that other users can see what happened when they get there. The application has four search feeds:
                    <strong>
                        new
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        near
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        hot
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        archive
                    </strong>
                    . The first two are self explanatory, they sort the posts by their lifetime or their distance to the user. The
                    <strong>
                        hot
                    </strong>
                    feed will sort by a score that we give to the post based on recent upvotes or downvotes so that old posts don't profit of their accumulated upvotes and new posts can reach the top faster. Finally, the
                    <strong>
                        archive
                    </strong>
                    contains posts that the user upvoted and posted.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was built in
                    <strong>
                        three parts
                    </strong>
                    . First, the back-end was developed with
                    <strong>
                        NodeJS
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        Typescript
                    </strong>
                    . We store our data in a
                    <strong>
                        MongoDB
                    </strong>
                    using
                    <strong>
                        mLab
                    </strong>
                    and our files in an aws bucket. Then, we created an
                    <strong>
                        android
                    </strong>
                    application written in
                    <strong>
                        Kotlin
                    </strong>
                    . Finally, we developped an
                    <strong>
                        iOS
                    </strong>
                    application in
                    <strong>
                        Swift
                    </strong>
                    .

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having to develop two platform-native applications was a challenge for us. We though about using web apps, but we opted for two native apps to up the challenge and get more practice in native app development.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have successfully completed most of our native applications functionalities(as well as the back-end of course!) in under 24 hours. We think that the project is very complete and ready for use.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the back-end side, we improved our skills using mongodb and aws a lot. As for the apps, we mainly improved our skills UI layout.
                </p>

                    What's next for AroundU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for us is to perfect our applications in order to publish them to each platforms application store.
