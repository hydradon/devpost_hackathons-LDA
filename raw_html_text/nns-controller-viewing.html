                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Newport News Shipbuilding informed us of a problem that could be improved on. Thinking about the challenge, the team felt that we wanted to keep our solution as simple as possible because of NNS's long legacy of efficiency when it comes to shipbuilding keeping in mind of the age gap within the company; in laymen's terms, we did not want to recreate the wheel. Instead, we took our inspiration from video games and decided to implement something that everyone can easily use and learn. The main reason we are utilizing a controller is that it is usable with all of the protective gear resulting in minimal change in workflow. We choose to enhance the user rather than ignoring their proficiency. Thinking about other technology interfaces, such as VR, we think that in this situation it is dangerous because they are interacting with VR rather than the real world. Technology like voice control may not be best in this situation because miscommunication issues can prove to be frustrating in a working environment.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application that takes advantage of windows API to provide user controls and makes it easier to operate the digital tutorial and animations through the SAP 3D viewer. This application acts as a mediator between the controller and the model. We highlight the use of this interface to complete the daunting tasks of keeping engineers safe while being productive in a restricted environment. The application communicates with the controller input from the user and the interface with the computer which ultimately drives the 3D modeling output.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Together, we brainstormed an idea and utilizing each team member strength to optimize efficiency and come to a conclusion. Using C++, Visual Studio, SAP sample, and other applications we collaborated work efforts and came up with a final product.
