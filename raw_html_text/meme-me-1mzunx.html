                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allowing students to explore their inner self by utilizing an emotional sympathizing software that perpetuates a journey of self discovery.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses facial recognition software (Affectiva) to detect emotions. Using that information, the Meme Me! generates a unique meme with you-- unlike any others out there.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used SDKs bundled with custom HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Node.JS was also used on the server side/backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The formalities of Javascript made it flexible to use, but also made it difficult to find minor syntax errors. Much time was spent searching for "Unnecessary tokens" and "Uncaught type errors". Also, SDKs were relatively new for us, so we spent a lot of time learning about that. Brainstorming an innovative idea proved difficult at the beginning as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Successfully used a facial recognition software
-Able to understand much of the SDK logic/flow
-Circumventing problems (ie. used phone as webcam b/c monitor didn't have one; used node.JS when secure server error kept popping up; eliminated interrupting code)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Time management (especially sleep!)
-Teamwork
-Problem solving

                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Making it into a real website
-More meme texts
-Direct export to social media websites
-Making it available on other platforms
