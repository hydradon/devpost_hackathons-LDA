                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the March for our Lives protests going on throughout the nation this weekend, we were inspired to view general sentiment throughout different states and counties to observe whether the political leader of this area's views corresponded with those living in that area. We hope this can be used to further understand opinions in an area and especially that of young people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scrapes recent tweets associated with an entered hashtag and then displays a heat map of the US showing the sentiment of those tweets.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this program using The Wolfram Language
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues with truncated tweets, as Twitter recently changed the maximum number of characters from 140 to 280.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we are able to link a very much visceral and tangible moment in US history to our hackathon project. We feel that although this is just a prototype, we are very excited to keep improving and developing the project.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to better utilize the Mathematica notebook and the libraries and algorithms available through it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tweet Map
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to refine our algorithm to better understand people's influences i.e. how many followers they have and how much a tweet is retweeted, adding weights to users based on an 'influence' score assigned based on follower number etc.
