                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hit a rut on our video-captioning project, and from there... we decided to mess around with the sound we had captured. Now, you can record yourself and your friends and come out with a fleek new track of your own making. Want to recite Hamlet? Belt out Taylor Swift? Rap some Kendrick? Now you get a combo of all three (even if you didn't ask for it.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It captures your conversation and mixes it into a sick beat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python, opencv (for the video) and sounddevice (for the audio). Then, we used numpy to shuffle our tracks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our way of getting away from our other challenges. (Coping mechanism).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could cope!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That when we don't know what to do, we can make SOUNDBLEPS.

                    What's next for SoundBleps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Can we make an EDM soundBlep? Tune in, next hackathon!
