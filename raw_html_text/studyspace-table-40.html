                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often struggle to find a quiet place to study, especially on the Hill. Plus, we feel like there are so many quality study spots on campus that a majority of the students don't know about, and we want everyone to be able to utilize them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StudySpace shows a map of some of the best study spots on the campus, and it also displays the hours and distance from the Hill for each study spot.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With most of us having never used git before, we struggled with merging different versions of the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we basically learned the basics of git, HTML, CSS, and Javascript and applied it to a project, all just in 12 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that once you know one coding, you own the ability to master as many languages as you want to put your mind to. We also learned about the true power of collaboration when making a computer science project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for studySpace (table #40)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to incorporate even more study spaces, how crowded each study space is, and even more information to assure that each UCLA student has all the resources they need to study efficiently.
