                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    you always wanted to find your mind twin ? you always wanted to have great talks with strangers but you don't know how to start it ? well, we all do because as humans we all love to find people sharing the same interests, whenever we are talking with new persons we are trying to find similarities, once we'll find it we'll be more comfortable. Many people can't make friends just because they can't start a conversation or find a subject to talk about but what if they can easily discover that the person they are talking to have something in common and all what they have to do is to find it and start the conversation, that would be easier ! 
One of our team members love using video chat apps and one of his doubts is how to find the right person to talk with, he is passing all his time just swiping in order to find this person and this can take a long time.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the first night, we had to choose a challenge that we want to work on it and once we decided we had to find a problem in order to find a solution, this step was the most important one, we spent the first night brainstorming and trying to make the idea clair. we started the developement process by sharing the work into different parts; making a video call, the UI of the app and a way to find similarities between users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the first and the biggest challenge is to find an idea in such big domain where you find big companies working on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    one of our challenges was using a new technology which is Flutter and new protocole which is RTC, then merging the work of each member, we could manage the work till the last minute even if we couldn't develop all the app as we expected
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to implement a simple RTC ( Real Time Communication )
                </p>
