                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you've ever played telephone or whisper down the lane, we tried to emulate this for the computer! Our inspiration for this was derived from a want to play these child hood games but over the internet!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program will change your life. Whenever you and your exactly three friends are bored, photo talk is there for you! The application will present a series of images and text for the user, and the user needs to either guess the image's representation or draw his own representation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a python back-end(flask) and used html, css and javascript for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems when we were using flask to display the websites. Sometimes the website would not properly display our images and the scaling was off sometimes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to create a full python backend server with little to no prior knowledge. Being able to create an automatic timer that synced all the users based on global time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely learned more about how server's work and interaction between javascript and api's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Photo Talk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to try to scale the app for mobile use. We want to make the website mobile responsive, and add Facebook integration for a more social aspect.
