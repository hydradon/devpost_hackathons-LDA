                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's always a hassle trying to figure out how to split the bill especially when each food is priced differently. It's even more of a hassle if there are multiple receipts. So, we created a web app that does for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app lets you create a workspace for a trip that you took with your friends. In this workspace you can invite friends to upload receipts during the trip. Everyone in this workspace can assign themselves to an item they're responsible for or assign people to items. Once they're done assigning, you can create a report in which it aggregates how much each person has to pay and to which person. 
You upload a picture of your receipt.

                <p>
                    We used python, javascript, html, and css to build this web application

                <p>
                    We want to be able to connect this to apple pay or venmo so users can easily charge their friends and friends can easily and quickly pay their friends. We want users to be able to customize their avatars so it is more to their liking. We also want to improve our OCR parsing so we can limit users from having to input their own price.
