                    Inspiration - We were inspired to create this non profit because we know how expensive doctor visits are. Every time that you get sick your insurance goes up, and because of this many people are starting to avoid going to the doctor. This is not healthy or safe because doctor visits are important and if you injured or sick you need to get treatment immediately. We created this website to help people get instant feedback on their injuries and treatments that they can get.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - Users must create an account and send us a picture of their injury. We will then give an estimated guess on what is causing their injury, and what treatments they should get. Users can enter their location so we can provide the closest doctors office that specializes in the injury. Users can also enter the price range that they want their doctor visit to cost, and we can provide information to satisfy their needs.

                <h2>
                    How I built it - We built by using standard web design languages such as html, css and java script. However, we made the HTML part interactive by adding user interface. Users have to tell us about their symptoms and send us pictures of their injuries.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - Some challenges that we ran into were creating tabs on our website to separate content and adding user interface (asking users to enter their symptoms).
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - We are proud of powering through our challenges and not giving up. Our tabs and our user interface works properly. We are also proud that this website can help save lives and money.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - We learned how to use java script and how to create tabs, and add user interface on our website. This is only our third time making a website and we are proud of the way that it turned out.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Medvise - We want to expand our user system, because currently it is just a sample output. We want to expand it by analyzing pictures from the internet and previous users to determine the user's problem. We would also like to expand our data base of affordable healthcare centers local to the user.
