                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was in start the viewpoints and the accent of the sicilian developer Angelo Agatino from Danske Bank. He has especially talked a lot about
                    <strong>
                        IOT Technology!
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Microservices
                    </strong>
                    where from we get a lot of our main design principles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It makes it possible to play together with other from a long distance and makes it easy to build further tools or games using the platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We setup a Joystick which is connected to a Arduino that has a serial-port open to a computer. The computer then has a Node-JS script running which listens on the port and sends the data on to a .NET API using Websockets. The API then processes the raw data for making basic user-instruction objects. A frontend then calls the API via another Websocket and uses the instructions to move a player and for our specific example-game move two dots around a screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Websockets were not supported on AWS. The first Arduino we had, the Spark Core, took a long to flash for each update which made the continues development slow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the webockets since we had never tried this before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using websockets in js and .Net Core C#.
analogs signal handling via Arduino.

                <p>
                    Making more games and further develop to support more controllers.
