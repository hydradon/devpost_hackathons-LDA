                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If I were to ask highschooler you how much you should spend on your first car&hellip; would 
you know the answer? If I were to ask 22 year old you how much you should be 
spending on rent to optimize your savings&hellip; would you know the answer?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The truth is, most of us don&rsquo;t know how much money we should be spending versus 
saving on the large purchases in life. Buying a house, buying a car, budgeting for the 
month, where do we even start? Sure, there are sites online with long explanations 
and a different calculator for everything, but that&rsquo;s so tedious it turns most people off. 
What&rsquo;s the result of this? People spend way too much money and make terrible 
financial decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This calculator would be a place where all of these things are condensed into an easily 
accessible location. You plug in some numbers, and it tells you the optimal amount of 
money to spend on buying a car, what your budget should be for a house, and other 
misc. things that you way encounter.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ended learning how to code in Swift and Xcode in order to get this APP operational. It was very tedious and difficult, but extremely rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have extensive programming language experience, and the only language we have in common was Racket. We were able to all offer our own form of expertise: Jennifer with her UI design, Krish with his math modeling abilities, Alex with this programming skills, and me with my limited Swift and Xcode experience. We managed to come together, Googling, coding, freaking out together, but we managed to pull it all together. We suffered the set back of a sprained leg, coffee spilled on a laptop, and now a laptop that has a dead battery. Through it all we've supported each other, and in the end, none of us would trade the crazy, hazy, insane last 24 hours for anything else.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create an app! How crazy is that! We're barely a semester into college, and we were able to work and come together to build something that we never would've thought was possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The power of working together, the many special talents that everyone has.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's so much more to be done! We need to finish up all the existing elements, add more calculator sections, add drop down boxes for some prompts, add links to financial institutions, the list goes on and on, but the most important one is being bought out by Capital One.
