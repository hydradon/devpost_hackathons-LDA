                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On her way to NwHacks, one of our team member's wallet had slipped out of her pocket as she left her bus, leaving her wallet abandoned and alone on the cold, grey petroleum floor of the translink vehicle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not all of us have reliable, secure pockets and stellar memory.
We aren't always going to remember to take things with us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Set a reminder within a few taps and goldfish will remind you to do whatever you needed to do before leaving.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built goldfish using Android Studio, an Android phone, and XML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android UI did not appear the same as on the actual device. Particularly, the margins and colours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning XML, finishing project with 1 less team member, scoping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android studio has a lot of built-in classes
                </p>

                    What's next for goldfish

                <p>
                    GPS and parking. Voice recognition.
