                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our interest in giving users agency in creating their own unique experiences through our story-telling platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a story-telling bot that has AR videos that the server sends back to enhance the story experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the bot using Facebook's NodeJS boilerplate for Messenger Bot. We also used SparkAR and Photoshop to create new textures and objects for our AR effects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first time users and teammates, we had to wrangle with the Facebook Messenger Bot implementations and using SparkAR to augment our users' experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have been part of a team of first-time hackathoners!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use SparkAR and Facebook Messenger API!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for nARative
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that our platform can help build communities around shared stories/experiences. We want to create a platform where content-creators can submit their own stories/effects which other users can also enjoy! We also were interested in the Live Watch parties' functionality where large groups can play through a story together via voting.
