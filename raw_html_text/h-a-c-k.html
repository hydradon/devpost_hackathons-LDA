                    Application designated to helping users determine their blood alcohol content without using measurement devices. This application can help individuals determine if they had one to many, or can take one to many. Primarily made as a web application, we were able to transfer it into a mobile app for more practical use.

                <p>
                    Program requires user input and their current/last amount of alcohol they
                    <code>
                        ve had. These inputs should calculate the blood alcohol content they
                    </code>
                    ve currently ingested, as well as warning signs to alert the user to stop consumption.
