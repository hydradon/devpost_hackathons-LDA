                        Method for EV owning homeowners to buy a "chargepoint" insurance policy which allows them to find a charging location during a regional grid outage.  Funds from the individuals purchasing the insurance can finance additional "movable" charging stations, which will normally be set up at convenient community charging locations. During an extended grid outage, the "movable" charging stations will be moved to a distribution grid scale PV system (e.g. 1 MW), where the home/EV owners can go to charge their vehicles and then continue to power their homes.
