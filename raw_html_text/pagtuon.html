                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The word pagtuon means to study in the Filipino language of Cebuano. We wanted Pagtuon to be a place to get children from underprivileged backgrounds excited to study and continue their education. Pagtuon does this by giving them the tools necessary to not only study educational material but also raise money as contribution towards their college scholarship funds.
Pagtuon grooms students from underprivileged backgrounds to become scholars by teaching them reliable study habits and giving them the chance to raise money for their college education.

                    It helps students fund themselves to go to college by earning points in quizzes. Once a student logs in to the website and starts taking quizzes, they earn bucks, coins and points. The bucks are transferred to real currency through donors and deposited towards the children's college funds which will be provided as their scholarship. The coins help them buy things from Amazon and similar brands which will help them in their daily lives. The points they earn while taking the quizzes provide a competitive environment, motivating the student to take more quizzes and further their concepts of academic material.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it as a web-application, using HTML,CSS and Javascript, because we believe that this platform would be more easily accessible to younger children who may not have cell phones.
