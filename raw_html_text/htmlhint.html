                <p>
                    During HackIllinois, the team brought the legacy code base back to life by refactoring legacy code and making features additions. This includes migration from
                    <strong>
                        ES5 to ES6
                    </strong>
                    to add support for more functionalities. Additionally, the code bundler of this project was moved from
                    <strong>
                        Grunt to Webpack
                    </strong>
                    which allows us to package the codes in UMD format, enabling the community to use the tool
                    <strong>
                        universally
                    </strong>
                    in more environments, including cli, browser, IDEs, and text editors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, we also submitted fixes to existing
                    <strong>
                        long term bugs in the code base
                    </strong>
                    . Furthermore, we
                    <strong>
                        expanded HTMLHint's feature set
                    </strong>
                    to improve the tool's functionality. This was accompanied with
                    <strong>
                        updates to the documentation
                    </strong>
                    as well. Lastly, we began the development of a new front end for HTMLHint to replace the legacy website.

                    HTMLHint is an amazing code analysis tool that aids code review and refinement. We were very fortunate to work on a powerful tool that has an promising potential. HTMLHint is a project built in JavaScript and we were able to update the project to improve legacy code and add support for future improvement to the tool's functionality.
