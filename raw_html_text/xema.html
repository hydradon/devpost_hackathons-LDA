                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Eczema is a chronic disease that affects over 35 million Americans, ranging from children to adults. The most common symptoms include itching and rashing, which can escalate to unbearable levels, causing sleep deprivation and poor mental health. Studies report that the annual economic burden of eczema, including productivity loss and impacts on quality of life, is estimated at $5.3 billion. Despite the vast market and target audience, there is currently no identified cause or cure.
