                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interested in exploring interactions between spaceships and planet gravity and how this can be automated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created an environment for training and testing different reinforcement learning models to learn what models are best at space navigation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used openai gym to create a new module. In addition we also used pyglet to render the current state of the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of them. Come by and we will tell you.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rendering is challenging and trying to approximated gravity doesn't always work well.
