                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We waste too much time in restaurants discussing what to order with our friends, and it takes even longer for the chef to bring the food on table.  So we came up with a solution that benefits both the diner and the restaurant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before going to the restaurant, choose a restaurant on the app with your friends. Everyone can swipe right on what they'd like to eat. Dishes are matched among friends after everyone has finished swiping. 
You'll be  be able to finalize the order with your friends.  If pre-order is available at the restaurant, you are your friends will be able to order and dine without waiting for your meal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No more arguing, no more waiting. The restaurant can accommodate more patrons and you and your friends will waste less time.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an iOS app using the Swift programming language and Firebase as our backend.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To link and matching common preferences for multiple users in the database since Firebase is NoSQL that doesn't support foreign key.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Matching was difficult with the NoSQL database.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We were able to accept multiple user preferences for a dinner appointment.
-We were able to implement swipe right for selecting a meal option and swipe left for not selecting a meal option.
-First time using swift push and pulling data from Firebase, even we failed to finish.
-We really love the idea of this app, it is very efficient and very profitable for restaurant since they can have more people dine in, and chief feel less stressful to cook if they can decide how long to cook.
