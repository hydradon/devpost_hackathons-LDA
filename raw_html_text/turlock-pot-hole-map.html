                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Turlock has recently been fighting over whether we should fix main used roads or roads in residential areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a system in which users can upload pictures and the location of potholes and then the community can vote to decide which of the potholes are the most necessary to fix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using MaterializeCSS for the front-end, javascript to interact with google maps api and our firebase NoSQL database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't get the coordinates from the google maps api to get submitted to our database since we didn't know how to do this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create something that we thought of on the spot and also use it to help the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to hand over responsibilities to others even though it may not be that specific group members strength. We learned how to use APIs and read and write data from firebase using javascript.
                </p>

                    What's next for Turlock Pot Hole Map
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were several other features that we wanted to implement that we didn't have enough time to.
