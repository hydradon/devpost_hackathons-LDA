                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Humanity has reached a state of integration with technology such that every new generation will be raised as digital natives, and programming will become a life skill rather than optional knowledge. At the same time, humanity is facing the global warming crisis which is reaching a point of no return.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is our
                    <strong>
                        goal
                    </strong>
                    to bring the two together, in an environment familiar to the users, to show that neither challenge is unconquerable, even at a young age.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile and desktop-accessible application intuitively teaches both coding logic and the impact of removing pollution from one's environment. The player controls a robot avatar tasked with removing trash from local waters by pre-programming a set of movement commands for it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the user progresses through levels, the programming challenges increase in complexity to include concepts such as loops (such as move-move-jump-move-move-jump) and if-then statements (if the object is trash then throw out if it is recyclable then recycle).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interface uses no typing or prior understanding of code. Instead, the user clicks a directional-input compass to encode a sequence of movement commands then clicks the execute button. The robot will then move based on the pre-programmed actions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was made as a combination of Unity's 3D libraries and Fusion 360's assets and was programmed in C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the team members were proficient in C# before the project began, which led to multiple problems which were either overcome or a new solution was engineered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make a 3-D augmented reality game from scratch in 24 hours in an unfamiliar language with new friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to quickly assess problems, take stock of everyone's skills and abilities, and delegate work to the group members based on these criteria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also learned the importance of forming relationships with others in a problem-solving scenario.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gold Team?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add more complex coding challenges which utilize more advanced programming skills as the user progresses through the levels. We would also like to add more environments and locations to show the truly global impact one can make.
