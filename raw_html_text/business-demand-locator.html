                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the desire to empower small businesses. Personally, I know that businesses struggle with finding a good location.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provide a mobile and web app to query user's interest in a potential business location and match businesses with the interests.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was built using node.js / express.js library. The frontend was originally built using Ionic/React.js but then we changed it to just android studio, but then we changed the frontend again to Ionic/Angular
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled greatly with the frontend. Many of us were not experience with frontend web development as well as javascript. We ran into a lot of roadblocks that stalled our progress. Some were relatively simple things like retrieving the data from the forms and making http requests with them. Another issue was getting the google maps javascript api integrated into the app

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, we were proud of our idea. We felt that it had an actual use for small businesses and our solution was something unique. We also are proud of getting a good design and plan figured out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about teamwork and learning when the best time to pivot. Also, we got the opportunity to learn some frontend frameworks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We want to complete the project and launch the application so that small businesses can benefit from our solution
