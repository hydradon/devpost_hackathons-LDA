                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The orignial N64 Pod Racer was one of the first console games we played as a kids. Since a good pod racing game hasn't bee released since then, it seemed time for an homage to one of the coolest races in the universe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows a player with an Oculus Rift headset to experience a fully immersive first person Pod Racing experience. Players can also use a project-tango device to experience a bird's eye view of the course, watching the player zip around, as well as fire bombs down to knock them off course.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity3D to develop for both the Oculus Rift and the Project-Tango device. A number of interesting systems were used to achieve the details that add to the immersive experience for the Oculus player. 
&bull; Inverse kinematics were used to animate the player model dynamically in conjunction with controller input
&bull; Custom shaders were used to create a volumetric explosion
&bull; Dynamic particle effects were generated for the Pod Racing engines
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we required a realtime multiplayer implementation to allow interaction between the Oculus player and the Project-Tango player, this was accomplished in unity by leveraging the Photon Networking plugin and API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Project-Tango Unity SDK requires specific build settings incompatible with the Oculus. This lead to requiring two separate projects, one for the Oculus, and one for Project-Tango. Asset sharing between the two projects was cumbersome, and the Project-Tango's static move scale made adjusting scale a requirement (the difficulty of which was compounded by the network synchronization)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a fun pod racing game, much of the development time was spent just playing the game we made. There are lots of details that were a lot of work that add to the polish of our game. Good 3D models, audio, and effects all add to the Pod Racing experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike general consensus, Macs seemed most compatible with the new technology. Even though Oculus has dropped official support for Mac, it was practically plug-n-play once we found the correct UnityPackage. Same with Project-Tango, which just worked as soon as we plugged it in.
