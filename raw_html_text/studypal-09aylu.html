                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed in class if we were to help a classmate, it meant we learned and understood the material very well. So why not put this into an app like StudyPal!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StudyPal assists the student in learning materials by personalizing education through the process of pretending to teach. The student will gain a general understanding of the term they are studying for, teach the terminology to someone with the same level of knowledge and describe the same term in as much detail as possible. The process will not only allow the student to increase the depth of understanding but also retain the information for a much longer period. With personalized feedback and study tips, students will gain confidence and become motivated in learning new materials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used c++ and the Atom code editor to write the program. Then the program is run through terminal. We take input from the command line which the user enters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were 3/4 of us beginners and this was the first Hackathon for all of us so we did have to ask for help on errors and how to go about our idea, how to execute, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although our product is not all the way complete, the fact we were able to make something that works in 24hrs was a big accomplishment for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons are great ways to gain experience, exposure, learn from peers and yourself. Doesn't matter how big or how small our project is, we all grew a lot by participating in the time at HackDavis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StudyPal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time:
1) Make a website or maybe a chat-bot that will host StudyPal instead of the terminal to make it more accessible.
2) More options in activities for users to practice with.
3) Users will have the option to share his/her study guide
4) Have some sort of user to user interaction (like ability to study with a buddy who is also studying something similar)
