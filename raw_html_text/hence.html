                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fire in downtown on Tuesday May 12, 2015 served as the initial inspiration. There was a lot of traffic, congestion, and worry that could have been avoided had both people on the street and on the sidewalks known about the fire before walking too close to  the danger area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea expanded when a friend said he was bored and there was nothing to do, yet there was a concert in the park only a few blocks away.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Authorized users such as government departments, schools, and emergency response can post fences to channels around events, problem areas, etc. Users can then subscribe to individual channels to only get notifications that they're interested in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The entire app is made to be modular, people can create channels just by importing json datasets. The system can even accept real time data.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Our team's first time making an Android app. There was a large learning curb.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made it work, and it's something that the city can use.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Geofences are a very powerful tool.

                    What's next for Hence
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be remaking Hence to better optimize the app and follow better coding practices.
