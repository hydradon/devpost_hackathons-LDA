                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned in our economics class that the amount of food the United States wastes in a day is enough to feed the developing countries in the world. This inspired us to find a way to minimize the problem as much as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RecipEats is a mobile app made with Expo that allows the user to take a picture of their refrigerator and, through the use of two APIs, generate recipe suggestions with ingredients they already have to prevent food waste. This allows users to match their recipes with ingredients they already own rather than having to go out and buy new  ingredients to match with their recipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with writing the plan and time limits for the app, which was followed by a steep learning curve with react-native and its various packages and APIs. We started off by adding the camera React component to the app, which took up a lot of time. We figured out how to get the input from the react camera into the APIs that would identify the food. We had to figure out how to take the output of one API and place it into another API, which was, by far, the most difficult part. We then focused on cleaning up to make it look nicer and debugging all of the errors that came with building the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges, most of which included debugging and a steep learning curve. While the challenges were numerous, we managed to overcome them with a little help from google and the mentors around us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud overall at the potential impact that our app will have when it is released into the public and at how much good it will do. We are also proud of our final product and how nice it came out at the end of all of our collective hard work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that no matter how hard things may appear to be, they are not impossible, and with a little bit of time and patience, the hard things will eventually become as easy as the basics of HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for recipEats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to release recipEats into the public for all to enjoy for the simple price of $12.99 for the base plan monthly and $29.99 for the premium plan monthly.
