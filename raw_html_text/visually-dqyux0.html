                        Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    I have this love for fashion and i used to see pictures of people wearing these amazing outfits and i would think from where did they get that.This pushed me to find an automated solution for my problem.

                        What it does
                    </strong>
                    It helps you find clothes/apparel similar to ones you spotted with a help of an image of that particular outfit, also provides you with the link for buying it online.

                    <strong>
                        How I built it
                    </strong>
                    We achieved this using the Rekognition api which provided us with object tags and also a custom ml model which further identified the clothing types, next according to the tags we scrape an online store for products.

                        Challenges I faced
                    </strong>
                    The main challenge we faced was how to go about the detection of clothing types which we solved using a custom model whose accuracy has a lot of scope for improvement. Also scraping the dynamic fashion e-commerce website was a challenge.

                        Accomplishments I am proud of
                    </strong>
                    Seeing the product work end to end indeed made the entire team proud even though the ml model needs improvement, we were still able to provide approximately similar products.

                        What I learned
                    </strong>
                    We learnt that with the use of AI and the computing power available today we can help improve the efficiency of many redundant and time taking human jobs.
