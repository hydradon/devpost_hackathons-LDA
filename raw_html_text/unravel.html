                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by many ticket scams on social media and the Fyre Festival scam that happened in 2017. Up till date, many articles have been written to warn and prevent users from falling into online concert ticket scams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Concert ticket frauds are evident, many are afraid of buying tickets on various online platforms due to legitimacy and trust issues and it does not help that ticket re-sellers often skyrocket prices. (Ticket Scalping)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a decentralized mobile application that allows users to buy, sell, trade and refund their concert tickets easily.
Each concert would be it's own blockchain. In the initial stage, concert organizers would supply a fixed number of tickets to the blockchain. These tickets would be regulated in the blockchain ecosystem. Buyers are only allowed to buy tickets. If they are not able to attend the concert or have to sell the tickets, they would only be able to refund the tickets (in which the ownership of the tickets are routed back to the organizers).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This way, buyers benefit by:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Having better price security when purchasing tickets
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Guaranteed validity, authenticity and legitimacy of the purchased ticket (Immutability of the blockchain)
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Sellers benefit by:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Having better control over their own supply of tickets
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensuring that all tickets sold are legitimate (blockchain immutability)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Business reputation is protected when no ticket scams regarding their organized concerts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fewer empty seats in concerts will increase the organizer&rsquo;s revenue through sales of merchandise
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Since the blockchain is immutable, it only allows for one source of truth for ownership of the tickets.
                </p>
