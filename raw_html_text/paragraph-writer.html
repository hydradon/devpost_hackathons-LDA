                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a machine that might be able to do homework for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes analysis that we input into the paragraph and reconstructs the sentence using synonyms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We imported _ PyDictionary _, had it first determine the part of speech, so that we could find related words of the same part of speech to use instead, and then have it construct a new sentence using subject-verb-object. When it became apparent we wouldn't have enough time, especially with all the errors, we deleted all that noise and just had it replace all the words it could with a synonym.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Are there any we didn't?
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that _ PyDictionary _ is terrible when it comes to words like "the" and "a," which appear quite often.
                </p>

                    What's next for Paragraph Writer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was thinking we would build a neural network to construct sentences. Unfortunately, we only had the idea about halfway in, past the point of no return. Definitely we should make it be able to connect more to the topic sentence and evidence.
