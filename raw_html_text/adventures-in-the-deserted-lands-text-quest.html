                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the great fans of DnD and text quests, our team decided to create something both amazing and a little bit silly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It kills you with the plainest design ever. No 3D, not at all. You can't survive this game. Your graphic-oriented vision will be destroyed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be serious, this game is a non-linear adventure. There is only one "happy end". 
All your actions have concequencies!!! We're serious!!!!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hand-made pictures (from our really real DnD campaign) and one python source file! We used Tkinter library (really old, isn't it?) to make some windows and buttons. That's it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us are beginners and it was quite challenging to solve some problems that arose during the development. For example, one of the main challenges was the creation of the model that would store player's choices. Our first model, based on simple counting was broken in the first non-linear joints. So we decided to use a "treeish" model as a basement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finally created it! With nice and quite unpredictable plot!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to build a game, based on choices (and how to sleep less than 1 hour per day).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Adventures in the Deserted Lands (text quest)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will broad the plot, increase amount of choises and add some other nice features, to make it more like text-rpg-quest. And, of course, more mushrooms.
