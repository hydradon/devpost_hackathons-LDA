                    'SuperQuest' means, a quest in supermarket, looking for some nutrition.

                    More Children are getting obese and we feel obliged to educate them with nutritional facts of food they eat every day while implementing it in a fun way.
If they get very basic knowledge in gamified app, such knowledge can contribute to healthy food life in adulthood.

                <p>
                    Basically this app is a lind of general object recognition, especially for food.
This can overlay nutrition information(or just coloring is OK for little children), or country which the food come from.

                    Due to the json answer is in a full english sentence, we used regex and parse the strings, which return only the nutritional value. *Special thanks to the head up from Spoonacular.
