                    The Origin Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a student, I often hear how nervous my peers get about job interviews. Company recruiters also wish that interviewing was more time efficient and less emotionally draining. If neither parties like how job interviews are done, then shouldn't we change the whole process?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recruiting technical talent that can communicate is ideal. Many potential employees are turned down without knowing what they need to improve. Some people gain the opportunity to interview by using "white-text" to cheat resume algorithms while these algorithms also overlook talented individuals. In addition, it is very hard for employers/recruiters to make an accurate judgment on someone after only the first meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Employers/recruiters have little to no assistance when it comes to determining how well an interviewee fits the job. Furthermore, interviewing many people in one day will hinder recruiters' ability to focus on and to assess their entire applicant pool.

                <p>
                    Our team used a healthy combinaton of programming languages and software to create this product.
                    <strong>
                        HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery
                    </strong>
                    were used to gamify interview questions.

                    were used to analyze the interviewee's responses.

                        Open Broadcast Software
                    </strong>
                    was used to enable videochatting and screensharing.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    At first, it was difficult to change in the interviewing process in a way that would benefit both the interviewer and the interviewee. The screensharing and videochatting consisted of
                    <strong>
                        Open Broadcast Software

                    </strong>
                    program. We stripped the audio for language processing in IBM, but it took a bit of time to get all the components to work together. The slow internet connection and the lack of food at the hackathon was also an obstacle. Luckily, the teamwork, communication skills and patience of our group enabled us to create a quality project.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group took on a very difficult problem and was able to produce a suitable project in order to solve it.
Getting a comprehensive streaming service was accomplished inside the timeline by re-inventing the wheel as little as possible. We realized that Twitch.tv, Open Broadcast Software, Screen Leap, and some front-end design along with some creative acting could make our product shine.
We took a lot of time researching and have more content than 3 minutes can reflect however, we are confident that this is a realistic startup company idea focused on B2B for the large corporate entities like Google and IBM.

                    In order to fully improve the interviewing process, we will need
                    <strong>
                        both companies and workers
                    </strong>
                    to acknowledge that the traditional in-person interview's time era is over.

                    We need clients with custom requests to process data on a live bias sample. Ideally, our early adopter would provide this type of insight so that we can further fine-tune our process and ensure our analytics stays accurate and reliable.
The next iteration of this product would include the facial expression recognition to further optimize the non-verbal queue of an interview for the employer to decide how heavily they'd weigh in (in case it's a tech-service industry).
