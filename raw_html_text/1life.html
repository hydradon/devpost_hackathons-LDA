                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create a something that's fun for the community...relates to road safety...and uses data about road accidents...?...Okeh...
Community = Lots of people
Fun = ...Fun
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...hmmm, what would be enjoyable for a wide variety of people, and fun...oh wait...a game.

                    It's a simple game, the user holds the left or right of the screen to navigate left and right on the road (respectively) if the user crashes into an obstacle a question appears, if they answer the question wrong, they die, if the answer right, they proceed. With only one life you strive to go as far as your knowledge or skill can possibly take you...welcome to 1life.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java in android SDK.

                    ...A lot...

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before this hackathon we had not yet learnt java so, learning Java on the first day of the hackathon was a pretty proud achievement for our team.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java, how AGILE programming works, and a whole lot of stuff about APIs. We also learnt that each member working separately on a piece of the program isn't the best idea, as it's easier to bounce ideas around as a group.
