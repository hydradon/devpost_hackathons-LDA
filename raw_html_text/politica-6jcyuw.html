                    Inspiration - We thought hard and decided one of biggest political problems present, was that there was no platform to see review and discuss politicians nationwide and locally, which is when we thought of politica

                    What it does: in a dew words: review discuss and poll politicians world wide, nationally and locally

                    Accomplished that we are proud of: We are very proud of what we accomplished today as none of us had ever attempted such a big project

                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned that coding is extensively time consuming, database management, and how hard backhand is

                <h2>
                    Whats next for Politica: We all decided that our idea was a very viable solution to the problems present in the politics industry, and that we would work on this even after the hackathon to better our solution

                <p>
                    We also had a companion android app in the works but due to server issues and time constraints, we scratched it.

                <p>
                    In the Try it out section, we have included the code to our website (in google drive that is outdated by one hour) as well as an actual link to the website and the forum which work! We have additional files/sites. We we were unable to upload the rest of our files and code due to time and wifi issues/speeds (server/database and sms bot)
