                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Current music suggestion services verbose and force the user to think in computer-centric categories. Other approaches require harvesting large amounts of data before attempting to become effective. I've decided on a new approach. I've always felt that often I don't even consciously realize what I want to listen to - so let's tap into our subconscious.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user gets sets of images flashed in front of them. They are encouraged to press very quickly (F for right image, J for left). The "idea" is whichever picture they ".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The backend uses cosine similarity as algorithm to detect similarity between sets of preferences. This has a couple of advantages:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Nonresponse can be easily modeled as 0 (-1 for left pic, 1 for right), allowing for time constrained image selection to still produce valid data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scales well with variable amounts of pictures.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gives a rigorous, objective result to the question of "how close" two sets of preferences are.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Our database is built with each user. This means I do not have to curate or create much data; it is organically grown.
                </p>

                    How I built it

                    What's next for MusicallyMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much better UI/UX. Many pain points for users currently.
Better optimized data structures in backend, currently using default Mongo settings.
