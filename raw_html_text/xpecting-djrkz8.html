                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every single day,close to 800 women die due to preventable causes related to pregnancy. The 9 months of gestation is tough for the expecting couple or the mother in particular and our vision is to create an efficient,effective and affordable maternity healthcare model that caters to the three segments of the process which is prepartum, labour and postpartum.We also envision to bring back the concept of midwife system into the birth process.This concept solves a lot of issues such a reduced uneasy hospital visits for the expecting mother, reduce in doctor appointment expenses, the doctor could outsource to a particular midwife center and hence being able to prioritize and treat patients efficiently, in developing countries midwife concept could open up a huge opportunity for education and vocational training for women in rural areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app would be accessible to the expecting couple, midwife and the doctor and the day to day health updates by the expecting mother or the parameters that is measured by the midwife is uploaded to the same portal. the regular reading taken by the midwife will get uploaded which will be viewed by the doctor and the next appointment will be scheduled. we worked with a hardware model for contraction intensity detection using arduino, piezo sensor and touch sensor. The frequency and the intensity of the contraction is noted and the couple or the mother is notified when she should leave for the hospital. The app also includes portions of prepartum depression coping mechanism by creating a forum for other new parents, psychologist and nutritionists.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML and Javascript, we created the website and stored database via firebase. Arduino uno for the contraction detection with touch and piezo sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a tough time finding the database for the app. the three level entry at the user interface was a challenging part. For the hardware part, waiting for the touch sensor to work according to the actual medical criteria was not possible because of time crunch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of the concept because it deals and solves many pain points spread over different stakeholders during the gestation period of a woman. We are proud of the final database that we created, since it authenticates users and stores data about each user. None of us had used firebase before.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned not to give up. there were a lot of problems that we were facing with the coding and hardware part till the very last of the hackathon, but we stood strong together and found a way out. We learned more about the coding platform and came up with a more feasible solution. We learned more about web development, as well as backend technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for xPecting
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future scope for xPecting would be including data sets from different bio signals so that a fully view-able electronic health record can be incorporated in it. We also hope to increase security for each user, since the data being handled is very personal.
