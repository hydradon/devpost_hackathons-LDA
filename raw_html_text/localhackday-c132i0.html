                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the genius idea of one of our partners. He was inspired by his high school calculus teacher, Ms. Young.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Netbeans and divided the work among the five of us.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know how Github worked, for it was our first coding competition and spent much of the time learning it and its intricacies. Later on, we realized that we didn't have enough time to learn and use Android Studio, and ended only with a starting screen and the use of J-Frame. One of the other problems was a slight lack of communication, which caused a slight difference of codes, that although didn't affect us too much, did show a sort of disorganization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud that we did learn Github very quickly and actually produced a project that showed the idea coming into place. This shows that with just a little more time in our belt and more experience, we could accomplish a lot more than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should get to know more about Github and Android Studio to further our experience and efficiency in the future. We hope to learn from our skills and create a bond with our teammates.
                </p>
