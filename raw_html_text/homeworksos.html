                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a question/answer format where we link the answers to the questions' key.

                <p>
                    A challenge we ran into was how to link the answers to the questions.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that all objects in the data base has keys that you can use to find/recreate it.

                    What's next for homeworksos
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe adding a helpful/not helpful button to the answers so it is easier to find the answer people are looking for.
