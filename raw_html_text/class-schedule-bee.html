                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm running a badminton club with 3 other partners during our spare time. Every week, we got a lot injuries from players who wants to signup for training classes. The class scheduling is a huge pain for us as it could take hours to talk and messaging the players, and manage all the existing class schedules
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It stores all the class information, as well as the existing players. Whenever a new player want to signup for a new class, it will chat with the player to get the players age, level and availabilities, then find the classes that player can enroll.
Players can also use the chat bot to check general information if the badminton club, check their registered training class, and reschedule classes when needed.
The chat bot can also automatically send remainders when a class is coming up for each player. 
When needed, chat bot could also send announcements to a group of players if the coach need to reschedule.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used botsociety to design the workflow and all the possible scenarios, then use facebook's messanger development api to build the chat bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the 3 members in our team had experience using the messenger api, it took us a lot time to learn the basic and config the environment
                </p>

                    What's next for Class Schedule Bee
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add court reservation feature for players who just want to come and play.
Add a payment function, and allow user to make payments and check balances.
