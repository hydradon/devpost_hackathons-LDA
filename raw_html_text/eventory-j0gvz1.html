                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt like as students, we weren't taking advantage of all the free food, swag, events going on on campus, mainly because we never here about it. A lot of clubs only reach out to people who specifically know about it, so this app is to get the information out on a wider scale
                </p>

                    Organization(or groups, or the host) can post the event.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned Android studio just a day before building the app, so we had to learn syntax on the fly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon and the first time using this program, so although we did accomplish all that we wanted to from this app, we did get some of the main points done. We tried our best, and we accomplished something and are on the path of creating the app we planned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork makes the dream work! No one of us could have done this project alone, especially without having much experience and under such a time crunch.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will continue to work on this to at least finish the app completely and launch it.
