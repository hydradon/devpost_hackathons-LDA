                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You just got off the bus at your stop and are running late. You hurry into your office and realize your laptop was left on the bus. You could call the CTA and hope it's still there when the bus returns to the garage, or you could use Findr
Findr finds the unique bus ID and tells the user when that bus will return to your stop, so one can get lost items before the bus returns to the garage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front-end in React.js and back-end in Python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The CTA API does not allow for directly accessing a bus ID from a past stop, so if the user does not notice immediately, we have to back-track the possible stops for a bus on the route and get the most plausible bus given the time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned the CTA API and made great friends!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going forward:
We would like to expand the UI and improve accessibility. Text to Speech(TTS) and font size options.
Add Google home commands and TTS.
Add a map element, so the user has a graphical representation of when the bus will return to their stop
Add a dynamic stop system to notify the user when the marked bus is near a stop close to the user's stop.
Make error handling more efficient.
Provide an interface to notify the bus driver that someone lost an item on their bus.
