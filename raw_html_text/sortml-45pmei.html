                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our members are part of TEAMS- Tests of Engineering Aptitude Mathematics and Science. It's a competition that revolves around the environment and promoting a sustainable future. Surprisingly, most people are unaware of what objects belong where, and in turn involuntarily hurt the environment. SortML makes recycling easier and more practical.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SortML utilizes CoreML to sort objects into two categories: Trash and Recycling. As the app is used more, it "learns" in real time and becomes more accurate and is able to recognize objects with more accuracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Apple's machine learning API CoreML to facilitate the integration of our Machine Learning Model: Inceptionv3. In order to build this iOS project, we used  Xcode and Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was an issue at the end. One of our members was more experience with code and was gracious enough to help us learn how to use Xcode for the day. It was tough for our team to make quick progress, but it was a fun and rewarding experience.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Integration of the Inceptionv3 model was a steep learning curve
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implementing the realtime function was astronomically harder than
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are educating those on how to maintain a proper environment. We also learned a great deal in a short amount of time and we are extremely proud of the product.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Xcode, Swift, and CoreML
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SortML
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More testing, better recognition, more categories. We plan to refine the app to make it the best it can be.
