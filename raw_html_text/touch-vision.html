                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wished to build a meaningful project with novel technology that would improve peoples' lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses Microsoft Kinect to detect depth in an image, and allows the carrier of the tablet to feel a friction-modulated representation before him or herself of the region in front of him.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Microsoft Kinect, although because the newer models were unavailable, we borrowed an older one from a friend on campus, found an old API, and used it along with OpenCV to run a Flask server with OpenCV on an x86 system, and streamed the video to a Nexus tablet with a haptic feedback screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The lack of Kinects and long unavailability of Tanvas
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        old library for Kinect
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        new, somewhat undeveloped programming + operation of the Tanvas
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        connecting video stream from server to tablet
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        convert from grayscale to sparse points for Tanvas
