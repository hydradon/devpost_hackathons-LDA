                    Reducify is an app created to reduce food waste from households. The app lets you input what items you have in your fridge, and it lets you scan your receipts to automatically add items to the app. The app keeps track of how old the food items are and when they will expire. Based on what food items you have and when they expire, the app suggests recipes you can make to ensure that you use all items before they expire. In addition it allows you to upload items that are about to expire to a sharing platform to allow other users to pick up the food for free.
