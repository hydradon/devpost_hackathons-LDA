                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making predictions might save and benefit each and every person's life globally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in a dataset, learns using some portion of it and makes a prediction on remaining part of the dataset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Python libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had to install many complex libraries and even getting to this point is an achievement for our team as this is our first step in machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that from nowhere, we kept the motivation alive even though with no-results for most of the time. Thus reaching this state is itself an achievement for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first step in machine-learning and now ML and deep learning are not that scary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Prediction using Machine learning algorithm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can always improve on the algorithm's accuracy and its future usage is definitely tremendous.
