                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At school, we notice that teachers try very hard to adapt their teaching styles to advantage their students, but they unfortunately fail. When thinking about a way to fix this problem, we thought of a way to detect the emotions and engagements of students. We then thought more and realized this idea could be furthered to the political and business world for all sorts of speeches, presentations, and conferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app demos the ability to utilize machine learning to determine the holistic emotion of a crowd based on individual facial expressions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Web Services in python to take in an image and produce confidence levels for various emotions. We took live images from our web app as data and manipulated our output into a graph to be visually appealing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to utilize the web camera in our web app and then transferring that data into Flask to be processed by the machine learning technology in our python file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to implement machine learning and integrate it into Flask and HTML was truly something we never thought we would be able to do, if not for HackTJ
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming in, we knew very little about Flask and essentially learned all of it in the last 24 hours. We were first introduced to the power of Amazon Web Services in the workshop which inspired us to learn and utilize its machine learning power in our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CrowdReader
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to use a real camera and apply our technology in the real world to benefit presenters everywhere.
