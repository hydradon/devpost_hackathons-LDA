                <p>
                    Bug Bite AI is an android app for identifying common bug bites in real time using a trained 
tensorflow model on your mobile device. Bug Bite AI was previously proposed for a contest, but not actually built. Using the MobileNet Tensorflow model, I was able to make this dream/concept a reality by retraining on sampled/labeled data for bug bites collected from the web!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is not designed to replace a legitimate medical diagnosis, but can help folks with unknown bites 
or irratations on the skin quickly find answers or medical treatment by a professional.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my friends came back from Asia a couple months ago and got bunch of bug bites, and she was afraid whether or not she caught malaria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thought that we can use techniques in AI to classify bug bites, as well as using tele-medicine to communicate with a dermatologist to validate the bite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unaddressed or untreated bites in dangerous settings can be dangerous; having more advanced diagnostic tools in the field can potentially save lives:
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BugBite AI is designed to classify bug bites using images in the field in real time across 5 common categories,
with about a 70% accuracy amongst the 5 labels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    People who travels, or places with deadly mosquitos such as zika or west nile.  This would give patients immediate relief.  Insurance company pays for tele medicine.  And just about any aid workers who goes to African jungles. The app could later incorporate recommended products for treating the various ailments to earn affiliate revenue - for example, recommending a particular lotion for reducing the inflammation of a spider bite. Telehealth could also be incorporated into the final app and allow users to connect with Dermatologists or other professionals in the field.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collected a small dataset of labeled images in common bug bite categories that appear on the skin:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Bee Stings
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mosquito Bites
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tick Bites
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spider Bites
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    and of course labels for the control group where there are no bites present.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once these images were collected, they were resized to fit the 224x224 model input format (using
                    <code>
                        resize.py
                    </code>
                    )
                </p>
                <p>
                    The output graph was constructed and converted using the latest tfnightly build (
                    <code>
                        convert.py
                    </code>

                    <li>
                        Better classify images based on skin types - potentially solvable by obtaining more training samples.

                <p>
                    There&rsquo;s also time aspects of bug bites - how does the app deal with time evolution after the bite has occurred and the person&rsquo;s particular background and individual immunity response to the bite?
We only classify the bug bite, the time evolution will be part of our training for AI, the AI will recognize different time series just like if the skin cancer spread, it would still be picked up by AI, it would actually be easier.

                    Building the Project
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Select
                    <code>
                        Build -&gt; Make Project
                    </code>
                    and check that the project builds successfully.
You will need Android SDK configured in the settings. You'll need at least SDK
version 23. The
                    <code>
                        build.gradle
                    </code>
                    file will prompt you to download any missing
libraries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The file
                    <code>
                        download.gradle
                    </code>
                    directs gradle to download the two models used in the
example, placing them into
                    <code>
                        assets
                    </code>
                    .

                <b>
                    Note:
                </b>
                <p>
                    `build.gradle` is configured to use
TensorFlow Lite's nightly build.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you see a build error related to
compatibility with Tensorflow Lite's Java API (for example, `method X is
undefined for type Interpreter`), there has likely been a backwards compatible
change to the API. You will need to run `git pull` in the examples repo to
obtain a version that is compatible with the nightly build.

                <p>
                    Connect your Android device to the computer and approve any ADB
permission prompts that appear on your phone. Select
                    <code>
                        Run -&gt; Run app.
                    </code>
                    Select
the deployment target in the connected devices to the device on which the app
will be installed. This will install the app on the device.

                    </code>

assets folder.
