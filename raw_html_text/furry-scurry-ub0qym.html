                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our inspirations was our university&rsquo;s unstable Wi-Fi, causing Google&rsquo;s dinosaur game to be a normal part of our web-surfing. The dinosaur game seemed to be a play on the prehistoric nature of the dinosaurs, but our game changed it to reflect the jubilant life of a rabbit. Our furry scurry was inspired by HackGT&rsquo;s theme, &ldquo;Into the Rabbit Hole&rdquo;, and we based major game ideas on it to create an entertaining form of code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Furry Scurry&rdquo; is a game where the rabbit must jump over the obstacles to survive as long as possible. As the rabbit scurries across the screen, the player must prevent the rabbit from hitting the carrots it passes along the way. Once a collision with a carrot occurs, the game ends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to design this game using Python through the Python library, pygame. Through Python 3.8, we created a variety of methods and classes that interpreted data from the game, and generated the corresponding outputs. In addition, communication was possible through Teletype, an extension of Atom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the game sprites in an aesthetic way was a bit of a problem. Cropping and removing backgrounds in online sprite setlists to create individual sprites was also difficult. Other than that, the scrolling background and random carrot obstacle generation took a while to figure out and implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our most significant accomplishment is the amount that we learned about game programming in a short amount of time. Two of our team members did not have any experience in Python, but were able to pick it up from knowledge of Java. Additionally, debugging our code was frustrating, especially with the movement of the carrots. Once we discovered our issues, it was a significant relief to our team as we took on the next problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the development of this project, we realized just how much could be completed within 24 hours. As first-years with little to no coding experience prior to college, we came into the Hackathon feeling daunted by the complexity of many of the projects. However, research, programming blogs, and YouTube videos proved to be our greatest asset as we learned how to program our game. Furthermore, as a team, we learned the value of spending our time wisely as we strived to make the best use of our time. Needless to say, we came out of this hackathon with much more knowledge and confidence in coding than going in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Furry Scurry
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we considered additional features we would have liked to include in our game, we realized that the more we worked on the game, the more opportunities for further development it presented. In the future, we would like to include skins for the rabbit player and the game terrain. We also realized that the game is a lot simpler than some of the other projects at HackGT, so we would like to include more challenging obstacles, such as moving carrots or obstructions approaching from above. Including a point system may also popularize our game, as players compete to beat the high score of their friends
