                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came solely from personal experiences. Whenever we have food with a group, either one person pays, and the rest of the group venmos them back IF they remember, or we inconvenience the waiter/waitress by throwing all our credit cards in leading to extra reciepts and wasted paper. Also, people miss out on credit card rewards if they use venmo to pay a friend rather than paying the restaurant directly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app uses the BRAINTREE sdk in order to let groups sort out how food should be split at the restaurant, and it lets them pay the restaurant directly  with the taps of a few buttons. This app works by generating a unique order number for each transaction. The customers splitting the amount can do so by entering the 5 digit order number. They are then given a choice if the split should be done evenly between everyone on the order, or if the split will be done by item. The app will automatically decide which card is used based on the type of business at which the payment is being made, and the card that will give the customer the maximum rewards. With this app, paper money and credit cards will no longer need to be carried around. It is also better than apple pay as no hardware is required to do the transaction.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift and x-code in order to build the application. We also did work in Python and JS for the server side of the app.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few issues using x-code and getting ruby to download on the computer.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of completing a demo of an app that we can see going really far. We are glad that we made an app that we know will be useful to everyone. With some perfecting and major convincing of businesses, we can really see this app going very far.

                <p>
                    We learned a lot about teamwork and planning. We also got to develop our coding skills greatly.
