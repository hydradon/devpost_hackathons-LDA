                    Posting on facebook should be as simple as that when you have an Alexa device and now it is. Facebook integration was the one key thing missing on Alexa.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I picked up the Amazon Alexa Api from the workshop and then got started trying to integrate Facebook and Alexa. I had to create a Facebook app and use OAuth to authenticate and link them. After that I used the facebook API to make API calls to interact with Facebook. I used Alexa intents to input the commands

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon kept force changing my devveloper marketplace to UK, while the Alexa server is located in US because of this the app would just not run and the error message was highly ambiguous. I spent many hours digiing into this and then figured out that this was the error.
I had to create a completely new account on AWS and Alexa specifically located in US and redo the entire app from scratch before it woul compile
One of the major challenges was integrating Alexa Skills with the Facebook API. Then making calls, to the Facebook API and parsing the output into a format usable by Alexa.
The Facebook API is severely limiting in what it lets you access. Ideally I would have liked to implement a "Read my messages" functionality but it does not let you access any users messages.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        API calls can no more read User inboxes or get friends. This functionality would have allowed to answer messages by voice or message particular friends through Alexa.
                    </li>
                </ul>
