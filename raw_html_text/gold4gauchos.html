                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before the quarter, when our team was signing up for classes, our team spent collective hours searching our professors up on ratemyprofessor, and painstakingly taking our classes and adding them to our calendars. We thought there had to be a better way!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our chrome extension displays important data on professors directly on the class signup page so that there are no extra steps in looking up professors. We also add a quick and simple add to calendar button that lets you easily export your schedule to google calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our chrome extension using javascript that runs in the background and on loading UCSB Gold.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with the major problem that all of us had little to none experience with javascript. Along the way, we ran into OAuth issues due to the project being a chrome extension, along with CORS issues, permissions problems, and a whole host of other technical difficulties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we created a finished product, something that our friends can use (and are already clamoring to get ahold of).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about javascript and how to scrape websites and inject code. We also learned how to build chrome extensions.
