                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes it's hard to pay attention/keep up with note-taking during lectures (especially when you just stayed up 24 hours for a hackathon). We wanted to create a solution to help students review what they 'should have' learned in lecture. We also think such a solution would be of particular use to students with learning disabilities.

                <p>
                    This app allows students to record lectures on their phone and receive a transcript, as well as a coherent summary of the most essential information. The UI allows students to easily organize these lectures/summaries by class.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used react.native for the front end. The app records and sends audio data to a Heroku endpoint to be accurately transcribed via rev.ai. The transcription is then passed to an extractive text summarizer (

                    ), which outputs a coherent paragraph summary of desired length.

                    Spilled water on laptop.
We originally planned to have direct interface between react.native and the rev.ai node sdk. We spent a lot of time trying to get this to work before realizing that node.js doesn't do this.
Tired.
