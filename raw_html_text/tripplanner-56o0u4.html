                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the sponsors of today's event. We were trying to put in as much we can from them into our application, while staying relatively new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a Web Application that is for the people planning a long journey e.g. around the world, so it would be closer to the everyday people by calculating the routes by the prices of the flights with concrete points to touch. We also made the Website easy to extend so it also has the capability to be more. _ We have ideas... _
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it out from scratch of course, only using technologies that we had at out hands. The technologies we used are listed above. Also we implemented the given SkyScanner API into our project too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Traveling salesman problem of course, which we solved by using a brute force algorithm for use-cases with few control point so it would still be computationally solvable. We didn't try to solve the problem we used a workaround so we would have time for everything else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The optimization of the SkyScanner API for our intended use, we couldn't just flood their servers with requests of course.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything that has been mentioned under our challenges, we are proud of the product that we came out with, and think that our code is nice and tidy, so perfect for further development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also proud of our look, we managed to get a clean easy to understand style in our website, which is enough for a taste of what we were planning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I for one Web-Development, but jokes aside, we used easy to use technologies so we would finish in time. Most of us were familiar with the frameworks, and the languages we used, with much left to learn. So I wouldn't say we learned anything in specific but we got lot of experience out of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TripPlanner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us still would like to further the development of our application, but it all depends on how much time we will have for the project, so I would say it is a maybe.
