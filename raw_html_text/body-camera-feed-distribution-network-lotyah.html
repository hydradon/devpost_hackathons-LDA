                <p>
                    Protecting law enforcement and the community by making the video from body cameras easily accessible to all.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It encrypts the video stream of a camera using AES encryption and broadcasts that encrypted stream out via a wireless LAN. Anyone in range can download the encrypted data. If the police department decides that the video needs to be public the key will be released allowing all to view the video stream knowing that nothing with the stream has been tampered with.
