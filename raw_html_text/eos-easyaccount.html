                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt that the EOS Tribe challenge was playing more into our team's strengths, which largely include design and full-stack web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EOS limits account creation as a matter of it's design (each account uses "RAM" in the distributed EOS virtual machine, and RAM isn't free). EOS Tribe wants to expand EOS adoption by making it easier to onboard people into the EOS ecosystem, by pre-funding accounts for people who want to sign up. In the event that there is no stake available to give someone a free account, though, they still want people to be able to pre-fund their own account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the requirements, we felt very strongly that our experience with Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript/JQuery, and design/typography would give us a strong edge in this case. It's a simple app with some tougher validations, so we wanted to use languages and frameworks that we were experienced with to do the work that we needed to do. Fortunately, we were strong in Ruby and JavaScript, and the core EOS.IO team has provided good, functional libraries for generating EOS-compatible keys and generally interacting with the EOS network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting our Rails application to an external MySQL database, and figuring out how to implement a JavaScript EOS crypto library from within Rails securely and reliably - such that private keys would only EVER be generated on the client-side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting EOS.IO's JavaScript libraries to work within Rails, and successfully generating an EOS key pair locally (AND keeping that locally-generated key pair alive through Rails actions).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An incredible amount. We gained a basic understanding of Solidity and what it can do, how to connect Ruby on Rails to an externally-hosted database, some of us learned how to use Bootstrap, and got a good understand of the bash command line, git, and the commands these powerful tools offer. We also learned we... were a lot better than we thought we were.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EOS EasyAccount
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Security, responsiveness, and recoverability! We don't want people to abuse EOS Tribe's generosity, we want them to be able to access it on any device, and we want them to be able to easily recover their information to the best of their ability.
