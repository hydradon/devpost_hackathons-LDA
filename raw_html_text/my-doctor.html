                </h1>
                <p>
                    What if we have our own  personal assistant who will be able to search all available practitioners, check their availability, make appointments for me, set reminders for due appointments and GP re-calls. The Goal is to have a centralized bot platform which connects all available practices (GP Clinics), so clients/patients will be able to choose any preferred practitioners from any clinics.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    MyDoctor is a revolutionized, interactive and user friendly chat bot which interacts with registered practitioners and GP Clinics for  booking, scheduling and managing medical appointments. It will also  be your personal assistant to remind  medical appointments.

                        Based on conversational analysis, bot will perform required actions via integrated health care practitioners management system API. (eg. adding patients, searching practitioners, checking doctor availability, making bookings, modifying bookings,etc)

                        Required conversation contexts are preserved throughout the conversation for better and flawless user experience. for example, if requested time slot is unavailable, user will be asked to choose he available time slots while remembering the details from previous conversation, such as date and requested practitioner name.
