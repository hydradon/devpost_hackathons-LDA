                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Encrypting your entire phone takes up your battery life faster than it should. The main point of the app was to increase privacy without needing to increase hassle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recursively encrypts file directories that you choose to encrypt. All of the encryption is done inside of the phone, and no external APIs are called. Uses signature validation to assert provenance of the files.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    All in java.
