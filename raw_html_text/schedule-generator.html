                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first idea consisted of a medical prescription and appointment reminder-app filled with prescription information and nearby clinic and medical office locations-- we figured people would want a simplified way of recording and reminding themselves on prescriptions. However, we decided to ditch the idea after a two days of trying to actually design that as an app. Our
                    <strong>
                        new idea
                    </strong>
                    consists of a
                    <em>
                        class schedule generator
                    </em>
                    . We were inspired to work on this idea because we went through problems that we encountered as students and considered the scheduling for courses, such as how complicated it is to organize an ideal schedule with different class times and possible dates especially when classes close as they fill up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to create a program that organizes an
                    <em>
                        ideal class schedule
                    </em>
                    automatically from user input of when they want their earliest class and what classes they need and produces the best class schedule combinations with those parameters. These multiple outputs are good for when classes close and provide the user options to choose from.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Python language and the Cloud9 platform to collaborate.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges that we ran into were following the logic of
                    <strong>
                        actually generating
                    </strong>
                    possible schedules and programming it in Python. We also struggled in determining the best way of creating a schedule and what parameters we needed to create an optimum schedule.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we dedicated ourselves to participating and creating something that we could all collaborate and learn from even though we spent most of the first day working on an idea that we ditched.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that perhaps we are not as prepared to create apps and more complicated stuff to participate within a hackathon. However, from this, we learned that we have the
                    <strong>
                        patience, drive
                    </strong>
                    , and
                    <strong>
                        energy
                    </strong>
                    to work on a project and to develop our skills enough to create something. Hopefully we can learn a bit more and apply our skills at the next hackathon to create something bigger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Schedule generator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We look forward to smoothing the program out and figuring out a simpler way of generating ideal schedules. Hopefully we can program for more parameters/constraints to be inputted, so that users can customize their schedules even more than just based on desired earliest class. Then perhaps we can implement the program into school course registration for wider and public use.
