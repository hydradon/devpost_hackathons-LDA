                    Charism.ai analyzes everything about your speech: head and eye movements, talking speed, sentiment and word choice. Then, it provides you with insight on key information through various graphs, as well as offers recommendations for improvement! We use Machine Learning and Data Science based on ratings of speeches to predict whether your speech would be positively received by others.
