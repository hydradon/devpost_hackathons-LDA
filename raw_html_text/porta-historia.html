                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people have problems imagining historical events, especially if there are no pictures and only text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Porta History help students learn in a faster more fun way through visual learning
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used the arkit through unity to make our portals and worlds
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the main challenge we faced was the lack of resources/assets that could be found in short time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we built a powerful team who work well along side each other
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the whole team gained more experience in using unity and augmented reality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Porta Historia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    in the future we hope to develop Porta Historia to have more worlds and places to visit and learn about
