                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since I started working, I realized that I spend all my day sitting at office and then going back home and sitting/laying in bed. My body had never felt worse and I realized I needed something to help me and give me the push to start stretching my stiff body again. I realized that so many people must experience the same, whether they are people working in the office or just people who don't move as much as they would like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill will create a stretching program from a selection of stretches. Each time the program is different keeping the skill fresh and not stale as it is used every day. The programs will first explain how to do the stretch, from what position to be in to what body part to start stretching, and then will count down so that it is easy to follow along. The program also accommodates resting time in between each stretch!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using NodeJS and the Alexa SDK kit. The Alexa SSML was exceptional in allowing me to give the control I needed over Alexa for carrying out the program.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ran into hiccups while trying to implement the functionalities of creating a stretching program and also challenges such as how to implement a stretching program, and design decisions such as whether or not to have a random program, and how long the programs should be. I even ran into challenges such as remembering which stretches I did back in elementary school. Even after this skill is submitted I can continue to work and improve, adding more stretches into the catalog.

                    Adding more stretches, and the options for users such as the ability to specify specific areas they would like to stretch, the number of stretches, and even for how long to stretch and how long to rest.
