                    The challenge is to help build a more connected engagement between the sponsor and the child by moving to a more near time communication system. Currently the only communication between the sponsor and the child is by letters that have to be reviewed, translated and delivered to the recipient. This process can take weeks.

                    Challenge accepted. Compassion is close to a member of our team who is a current sponsor and loved the idea of having more engagement with the child he sponsor. How could we say no?. We thought, we had a solution that could help build that engagement and make a bigger impact for both the sponsor and the child.
