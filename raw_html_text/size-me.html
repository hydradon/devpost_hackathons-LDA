                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Online shopping is rough. Confusing sizes, hard to locate size charts and varying measurements from different brands are just the surface of troubles people run into when shopping online or when they have no time to waste trying on clothes. Size-Me is an application that reduces those pains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application takes user inputs on 3 simple measurements and is able to generate their clothing size from a variety of stores.
