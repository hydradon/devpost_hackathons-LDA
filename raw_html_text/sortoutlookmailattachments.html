                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We get many attachments trough mails with different types. May times difficult to find the attachment files in the mail and we have to search and open the files to find the right one. Also sometimes we need to organize and merge  similar kind of files and it will be good if attachments are downloaded and saved automatically.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This workflow example take advantage of Outlook App Integration with UiPath and download attachments from various folders and sort files based on the type of the files. Then downloaded files are grouped and saved in the folder with same name as the extension of the files  e.g.  .docx, .xlsx, .jpg etc.  Now user can schedule this workflow and automatically download and sort the files.
