                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by the current environmental and global warming crisis. People do not recycle or compost enough, and inefficient practices of these do more harm than good. By keeping the planet cleaner and reusing materials and reducing waste, we are helping keep humanity alive. The idea was first conceived by Valery Delva.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website teaches people who are new to recycling how to be more environmentally aware. The app will have info on how to recycle and a map that shows people the locations of bottle returns, recycling bins, and other essential parts of creating better earth.  Also, the app will be able to distinguish what is compostable and where to find those receptacles as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by using HTML coding and javascript. It took a lot of trial and error in order to form the basis of this project, but we have lots of ideas on how to improve it and take it further in the future.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, we learned how to build a webapp from scratch.  None of had experience creating a site starting from the beginning at first.  We also did not have all that much experience working in HTML as a team.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning, having fun, and getting a great start-up for our web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work together as a team and code a web app from scratch.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Revocycle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Revocycle will hopefully eventually be in widespread use and an app, so location services can be used to show locations for all recycling bins using crowdsourced data.
