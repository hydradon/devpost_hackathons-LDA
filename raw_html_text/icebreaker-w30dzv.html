                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very often people who  go into meet ups /conferences spend a lot of time getting to know a person before they can actually strike a meaningful conversation. This limits the number of networking opportunities.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Icebreaker strives to make networking more productive by  integrating  information from LinkedIn and the capabilities of facial recognition. Let us consider the following scenario:
A person X who wants to work with another person Y but does not know anything about Y.
All he/she needs to do is take a picture of that person. The face recognition component scans through a previously curated database of linked in profiles, matches the person by the linked in profile picture and pulls out the details regarding their work, interests etc.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the app using android studio. For image recognition we used kairos.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first android app development. We found it hard to integrate the image recognition with the normal app.

                    We got the android app  up and running  and were able to capture the images from the user.

                    Android dev is fun but can be painful sometimes :)

                    **PS:
Taking a picture and  doing face recognition might sound  as a privacy violation. We hand initially planned doing face recognition through a video .However, the image  was the ebst we could get to.
