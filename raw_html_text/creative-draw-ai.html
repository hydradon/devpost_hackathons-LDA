                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Analyzing people&rsquo;s responses to images and drawings is a technique that has been used in the field of psychotherapeutic research since the early 1900s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drawing is one of the ways we have of expressing our innermost self, feelings, what goes on in our heads more subconsciously like no other activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Behind every picture, there&rsquo;s a story.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like no other activity, drawing allows us to express emotions, experience autonomy and build confidence without the usual filters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, why don't we examine those drawings with a simple game? I think we have a lot to learn from them.
They may give us important insights into many physical, emotional and, cognitive aspects of ourselves.

                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The user has 10 seconds to draw a simple picture on a blank canvas.
CreativeAI tries to guess the name of the picture (house, tree etc.).
The user can teach the system when it fails to identify the picture.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How I built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The core of the application is an AWS Aurora Postgresql database with a PostGIS extension.
Three main APIs trigger frequent INSERT and SELECT statements.
The APIs are built with NodeJs, AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The search API, used to identify the draw, is the most important:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A client-side Javascript smoothes the drawn lines.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An algorithm inside the API simplifies and standardize the user's scribble data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A PostGIS statement plays a major part in identifying the picture.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The "stats page" queries the database returning various statistical data.
A bastion host is available to run additional custom queries like a similarity learning task used to optimize the system's algorithms.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenge I ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Main challenges were around picture identification and performances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After multiple benchmarks, I've decided to use AWS Aurora PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension.
Aurora delivers up to 3X higher throughput than a standard PostgreSQL so, was not even necessary to use a cache layer between the API and the DB.
The responses are very fast, sometimes it takes less than 20ms to identify a picture.
To keep the performances on top, I've decided to have database clusters in 2 different regions using the Route53 latency based route to process the requests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An asynchronous process runs every hour to reconcile the training data between the 2 regional databases since Aurora PostgreSQL doesn't support cross-region replica yet. Wasn't a problem for this application since works well with the eventual consistency model.
                </p>

                </h1>
                <p>
                    Improve the algorithm, release the data as open data or allow users to run statement via a public API.
