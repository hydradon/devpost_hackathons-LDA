                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The migrant crisis is a worldwide issue and is especially more pressing in the Greek coasts. Every day, there are hundreds of shipwrecked boats filled with refugees that wash up on the shore - dramatic scenarios. While discussing with reporters covering the story in Lesbos, I asked what could the tech community be doing? Their answer was that the camp organizers over there are overwhelmed: "There are so many boats that we can&rsquo;t keep track of which ones need help. We would need a way to get alerts for passengers that are in distress."
                </p>
                <p>
                    They assured me that due to the small strip of sea separating Turkey and Lesbos migrants travelling have access to cellular network and often a smartphone along the journey and roam all the way through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So came the idea for Lighthouse!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lighthouse is a combination of a mobile app for migrants navigating and a cloud dashboard for the rescue teams on shore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a boat is in distress, anyone with the application downloaded on their phone can launch it a press an alert button that will send their coordinates to the closest shore station.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This station has access to a Lighthouse dashboard that monitors alerts in the filtered area. When rescue teams receive that alert, they can choose to acknowledge it - which will send a message to the migrant's mobile phone letting them know someone's coming (so they don't lose hope).
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The mobile app is developed with Ionic and AngularJS to provide a universal app for iOS, Android, Windows phone, and web access.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The dashboard is an AngularJS application that uses the Google Maps API to place the alerts on the map along with a filter zone (to avoid spamming)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            All the alerts and rescue messages are sent and received using

                                Firebase
                            </a>
                            to provide a real-time communication system.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though the original idea was fairly simple to execute, getting more and more features for ideas made the development process more complex than expected. I had never used Ionic or Firebase before (though I had some previous knowledge of AngularJS), fortunately the documentation was perfect!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time that I build an end-to-end realtime communication system from an app to a dashboard and also the first time I've worked with some of the technologies. I am very proud that I've been able to build a working prototype for a cause that I care about - which could have massive impact on the conditions of the migrants through their tough journey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other than the actual technologies that I've played with, I learned that you don't need to be a top notch programmer to make an impact on the world. All you need is some creativity and be determined to fix things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lighthouse App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lighthouse is bound to evolve and get other features that will make its use truly impactful. Here are some of them:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Allow rescue teams to chat through to the migrant's app when acknowledging an alert. This way they can relay some important safety and first aid instructions.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Integrate an SMS mechanism to send the coordinates this way instead of IP to alleviate the roaming charges.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Integrate Natural Language Processing and recording to detect distinct words and send back pertinent instructions to the app.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            which will allow for a decentralized way of conveying these alerts in the case that migrant does not have cellular network.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Implementation and testing: now it's time to travel over there and implement and test the solution
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Lighthouse will become part of a bigger project called
