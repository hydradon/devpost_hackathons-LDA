                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our blockchain Lead could not make it to the Hackathon so we needed to think. This is not just a team problem that we need to solve but a real-world adoption issue we need to solve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We tried to hook up a chatbot to facilitate the whole process of setting up your own Colony (from colony.io) without needing any programming / blockchain experience. We tried to keep everything in a chat that means one does not even have to struggle with npm stuff*
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have scaled up on our blockchain skills.
We managed to create a boilerplate HTTP API on top of the ColonyJS library and made it accept HTTP Post calls as input to setup a colony.
We then created a Dialogflow Chatbot that connected to the HTTP API for the whole process. So the user can do the whole setup process from their messenger
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Above all, we realized how less difficult that it appears most blockchain applications are. this just intimidates a lot of developers, using a chatbot to build up was one way to get more people involved without having to worry about a lot of coding and configurations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snake Nation Colony
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adapting it into our expansion model. Going into 20 countries throughout Africa. We plan to use this as a way to organize our decentralized societies and assign task, evaluate, and pay for services.
