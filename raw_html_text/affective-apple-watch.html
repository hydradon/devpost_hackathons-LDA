                    Computer's should be able to recognize and understand human emotion. Electrodermal activity (EDA), is the property of the human body that causes continuous variation in the electrical characteristics of the skin (Wikipedia). In general, it is a measure of a person's current state of arousal caused by fluctuations of the Autonomic Nervous System.

                    A watch band that hooks up finger electrodes to measure a person's EDA. When there is a jump in EDA, then the user is notified.
