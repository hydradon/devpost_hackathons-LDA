                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is inspired by the Wikipedia Game, in which you have to get from one Wikipedia article to another one by just clicking on links in the articles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is very similar to that of the Wikipedia Game: navigate from one hashtag to another through Twitter posts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used the Twitter API, along with Javascript and node.js to grab necessary data. The whole game is built using jQuery and socket.io.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because there are hundreds of thousands of Twitter posts, there has to be a way of filtering all the hashtags, so as to leave only the ones that are relatively similar. Otherwise, the game is pretty much impossible to complete.
We have tried to make use of the Majestic API to categorise various hashtags, but this has proved to be quite a challenge to implement, given the constraints on API calls and the limitations of the API itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are satisfied with learning on how to interact with a Web service through API calls with node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have gained experience with using an API as a basis for a completely new platform, alongside with getting to know server-side scripting and HTTP to make requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Twitterace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate Majestic API to help pick out hashtags that are somewhat similar and realistically close in terms of Twitter posts.
