                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technology seems to be all around us, determining increasingly more and more aspects of our daily lives. But unfortunately there are still many people that are left behind. They may not have discovered the potential of technological devices and their benefits, or simply don&rsquo;t have access to it due to physical impairments, financial reasons etc.
                    <br>
                    Our goal is to reach this part of the population. Especially elderly and people with chronic diseases that are not using actively smartphones in their daily life and consequently don&rsquo;t use apps. Wearable technology could also be challenging for use for this target group, because of the maintenance of it &ndash; most of the wearable devices must be charged  and being weared regularly.
We believe that the implementation of IoT could increase the life satisfaction of this focus group and allow them to maintain an independent life without relying on their relatives and spending money on private assisted living. So we thought about ideas that could help individuals from our target group that are willing to live alone at their homes as long as possible.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is to focus on the home environment of the individuals from our target group and integrating sensors in this environment according to the specific needs. The Sensors would be connected to Alexa, which would allow usage without owning neither smartphone nor wearable device.
Our idea provides the necessary safe and controlled environment, but also to improve the daily life of people with diseases.

                <p>
                    The sensors: motion sensor, contact sensors (for doors, fridge, food-storage closet), smart power plug.
Alexa as Framework

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We combine different technologies, as seen in the slides (Alexa, Z-Wave, Raspberry, Loudspeakers, sensors - motion, contact, smart power plugs...)

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Security issues with Amazon
Make the sensors communicate properly with the current network environment
Limited time

                <p>
                    Great focus group with Alex and his grandmother
Discovered new technologies we can use
Connecting many IoT gadgets
