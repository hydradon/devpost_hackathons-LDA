                    Twitter is a powerful and popular platform that allows students to display their unique personalities and interests. During the admission process, admission officers often have to perform the tedious task of manually searching up prospective students on social media.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a solution to this problem, we developed a program that allows officers to look up the most recent tweets of prospective students by only entering their first and last names. Our python web scraper then extracts the latest tweets of students and stores them using Firebase, a development platform that allows users to create real-time, cloud based, databases.

                <p>
                    Attempted to deploy it as a website, but we were unsuccessful, unsure why
Working with unfamiliar technology and finding relevant resources to work with
Importing python modules didn't always work correctly which lead to errors in our code
Finding patterns in website URLs that were consistent
Finding tags to search for within HTML file to isolate the tweet as text
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web scraper works in a simple manner, needs only 3 simple user inputs
Became familiar with Google Firebase technology and learned how to incorporate it as database storage.
Able to incorporate it successfully even though we couldn't format our fields as we wished

                    In future iterations of this web scraper, we would implement the service as a website deployed via the Google Cloud Platform to make it easy for admissions officers all around the world to use and access it.
