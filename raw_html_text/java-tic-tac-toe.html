                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have had some past experience with Java and wanted to make a game. So, I put two and two together and made a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program was simple. It used an array to check valid placement of X's or O's against the already-recorded turn, and a win-check was called every turn using this array. A series of string variables existed to give the player a visual, which was constantly updated along with the array. To make its turn, the computer just generated a random number, which was translated to a grid location, and placed an O if it wasn't occupied. If it was, it would just generate another number and iterate through the loop until it picked one that wasn't.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the absolute worst stroke of luck possible, my graphics driver crashed, at 11:55. The program was nearly done, but I hadn't saved for about 150 lines of code--90% of the program... and I tried to CTRL + ALT + DEL instead of CTRL + S.
                </p>

                    SAVE YOUR WORK AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. CTRL + S BEFORE CTRL + ALT + DEL
                </p>
