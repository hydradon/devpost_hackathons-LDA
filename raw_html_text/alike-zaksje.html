                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that a lot of university students, especially freshmen, have a hard time meeting friends with similar interests. As a result, they decide not to participate in activities that they are interested in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app randomly matches students based on their interests and availability. This allows them to have a conversation with people alike. We're flipping the convention of traditional social apps by focusing on mutual interests instead of on someone's profile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We modelled our webpage on paper then transferred our ideas to our platform through the use of Figma. Then we created the demo collectively with front and back end development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first wanted to make a mobile app but then realized it was not feasible within the time constraint (none of us had mobile app development experience). This was also our designers' first time creating a UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have been able to complete a demo version of our app. Alike has the potential to become a platform with a strong social impact that bridges the gap between similar people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We strengthened our technical skills and learned a lot from each other.
                </p>
