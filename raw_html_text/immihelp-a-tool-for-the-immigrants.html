                    Inspiration: When we were asked to work on a program, that helps solve a socio-environmental problem, we realized that thousands of immigrants that land in Canada on a daily basis, are left in a puzzle as they don't have any information to help them settle down. So we decided to come up with a program or an application that will help them.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Basically, this is a simple application, that can be accessed on a webpage we created. This application provides immigrants with information like housing, schooling for their kids, job listings and some more information on immigration in Canada. It is gonna ask the user for some inputs and accordingly the program outputs.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used Java and google sites to make our application
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Initial plan was to embed our java program on to the website we created, but unfortunately, the programmer of our group, that is me, was not aware on how to do so as applets have been suspended by google for security reasons.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Initially, we were not sure what to do, but with excellent brain storming and team planning, we were able to wing it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: better time management and creative thinking will help us succeed.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for immiHELP: A tool for the immigrants; we are going to continue updating this application, and on one fine day, we will be able to execute our original plan
