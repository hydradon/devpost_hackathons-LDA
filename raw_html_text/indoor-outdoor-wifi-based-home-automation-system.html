                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to build an home automation system ; simple to use; integrate as many sensors as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collect data from the outdoor node, transmit the data to the cloud. Also inform and triggers alarm if required to the interior home automation system
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we build it using Photon board. We integrated flame sensor, motion sensor, voice sensor in the inner home automation system. 
In the outdoor unit, we integrated distance sensor to detect the entry of a person/ car in the outdoor area and open the inner gate. Also indicate about the outside temperature and humidity to the inner node. Also we integrated a water level sensor which indicates high water level to the indoor unit and activated an alarm.
Also communications happen through WiFi and also can be accessed on your phone or computer from anywhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had the challenge of communicating the outdoor node to the interior node and we implemented it through WiFi
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy that we implemented a fully autonomous battery powered connected home automation system using WiFi
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned working on a new board, also we leaned about communicating through cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Indoor-Outdoor WiFi-based Home Automation System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deploying it to real environment which will ease mankind and make him comfortable.
