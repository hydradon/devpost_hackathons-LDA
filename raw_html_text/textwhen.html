                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought the idea of hacking transportation and social interactions within that sector was really interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We take Google Maps data to find your current location and how far you are from your destination. When you are a certain distance from your destination, we will text whoever you choose to contact, using Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of problems because we initially chose to do a different hack, and didn't switch over to this one until halfway through. Also--neither of us had ever programmed for Android before!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both learned a lot about developing for Android.

                    What's next for textWhen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully some other hardware hacks that help stop distracted driving and help people out in their busy daily lives
