                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to hack on the HTC Vive and learn a new technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VR DJ allows you to visualize and manipulate music. You are placed in a world where you can see glowing bars that change size based on the frequencies of the music. You can then change the volume by moving the controllers up and down, change the tempo by moving the controllers closer and farther apart, and move to the next song by moving one controller up and the other down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and the HTC Vive to develop our hack. Since neither of us had significant experience with Unity and we had zero experience with Vive, we built it very slowly, learning along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty detecting input from the HTC Vive controllers and eventually chose to work around the issue due to time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a thing! Our hack works and is usable, and actually provides an interesting and somewhat humorous listening experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots! 
We learned how to use Unity, C#, basic algebra, and the Vive!
