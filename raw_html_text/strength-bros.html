                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    (For context we had a lot more in this section but then it didn't save properly. We can explain everything in person in our demo)
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started off the day wishing to obtain a Fitbit. With our request sent, and our hopes high, one of our team members went to go grab it from the MLH booth. "They gave out the last one right as I got there." Through a bit of research we realized that we can access cell phone's sensors through a web browser API. This was actually a blessing in disguise, using our phones meant that we could have multiple players on different platforms provided that you have an accelerometer. This inspired us to create something similar to JackBox.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We pit players against each other in a race for the most squats. We had originally planned to have multiple game modes but that had proved a bit too much for 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A host machine displays the graphics, while player devices read the accelerometer data and send it the Node.js server. The server then propagates this data to the host machine. Communication is done through web sockets.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Communications, learning a new API, dealing with the sensors through the web API

                    We got it to work after struggling so hard with no real documents and stack overflow resources

                    Develop more game modes, add in proper assets, refactor code.
