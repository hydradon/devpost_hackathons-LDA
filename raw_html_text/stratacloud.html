                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StrataCloud is an investment platform for algorithmic trading that focuses on ease of use and access of information. Conventional algorithmic trading platforms demand a high level of technical knowledge in multiple fields. A technical background in stocks and markets as well as a programming or data science background is required to develop and implement a trading strategy. We believe that StrataCloud has the potential to pull in new algorithmic traders and investors from multiple fields because of its ease of use.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StrataCloud provides users with necessary background information to quickly become knowledgable in the field as well as live algorithmic trading strategies that they can immediately start investing in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The platform was built using react, blockstack, mongo db, digital ocean and twilio. The algorithmic trading strategies were built using quantconnect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StrataCloud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was built in a weekend we could not actually trade on the market. Moving forward, StrataCloud's trading algorithms will be hosted live and begin to trade in the market.
