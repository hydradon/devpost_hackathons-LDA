                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make something that is useful, but it really isn't that useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program's main purpose is to turn Youtube links into mp4 files then turn those mp4 files into individual frames. Those frames will be on a .html file with the .html files redirecting to each other to make something similar to a video. This project doesn't really have a point
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this program using Windows Powershell, .sh scripts, .html files and a Github file. I mashed them all together to create this monstrosity. I planned on using Wallpaper Engine to help run the .html files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linux is hard to use for beginners. Even if you know what you are doing, Windows Powershell is still different from normal Linux systems. Writing shell scripts is hard and I didn't finish all my shell scripts. My team also all left and I had to code the scripts myself. I also ran into the challenge of the code that I needed on Github could not be used for Windows PowerShell. The code on Github was very hard to read and usually poorly documented. I couldn't understand some of what they wrote and PowerShell would sometimes refuse to run code from Github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I learned more about the Linux system and Windows Powershell. I am also proud that I have submitted something on the Steam workshop for Wallpaper Engine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned much more about the scripting in Windows PowerShell, which I wouldn't recommend. I learned how to find good information online and how to find good open source code if there was any to use.
                </p>

                    What's next for YoutubeLinkstoFrames Converter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project could be expected to have additional features, such as automatically creating the .html files and automatically using Wallpaper to run .html code.
