                </h2>
                <p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Figma and HTML, we designed a prototype website that serves as the main site of AMI and a design prototype that represents the ideal version of the website.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with a solid idea was our biggest roadblock as it took the most amount of time. We wanted to find a market niche to fill but could not think of one that would be easily filled.

                <p>
