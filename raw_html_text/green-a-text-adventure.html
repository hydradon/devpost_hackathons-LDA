                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My main inspiration came from classic text adventures like Zork and Colossal Cave with a large focus on storytelling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players navigate through an evil lair of sorts (evil energy company's HQ) choosing different rooms and solving puzzles and riddles in order to escape to green! Along the way users are accompanied by green the floating box of awesomeness as he aids them in their escape and teaches them more about green in an easy and simple manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I set a full programming environment up for Python3. From there I structured the game layout, such as the main room and rooms 1-4. Each room was given either a puzzle or riddle. In order to allow for a more dynamic user experience, players are allowed to choose their paths. With that said, each unique combination was coded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A large challenge that I faced was syntax. Given the highly sensitive nature of coding, attention to detail was key. Thankfully I managed to overcome this challenge and grow from it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is by far the most extensive program that I have ever made (1824 lines of code) and I am proud of the time management aspect of this project (finalized game in less than 24 hrs).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Code is never really finished, there is always room for improvement and innovation. Tackle one hurdle and move on to the next. Also patience is key because art takes time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Green a Text Adventure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Innovative change, increased game complexity, and an enhanced UX. There will always be opportunities to grow and advance Green a Text Adventure.
