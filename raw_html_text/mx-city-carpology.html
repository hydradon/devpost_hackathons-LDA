                    Can I hear Mexico City Government saying that:
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.) Most of traffic in Mexico City is caused by empty Vehicle crowding the road and 
Rush hours account for a large portion of each day (6-9:30am / 4:30-8:30pm)
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.) Can I see Mexico City creating

                        Hoy No Circula program
                    </b>
                    which restricts driving on a schedule determined by a colored sticker based on a vehicle&rsquo;s 
license plate number. All vehicles subject to the program are prevented from driving between 5AM and 10PM one 
day per week, and some or all Saturdays each month.
                </p>
                <p>

                    How the app works.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The app has 3 major components:
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        1.) Public Carpooling:
                    </b>
                    This components enable Mexico City users to board on a Public Metrobus Transit and carpool just
with the member of the public. To do this, The user just login and can navigate to all the bustop and routes covered by Metrobus Transit. The User choose her routes from her nearest bustop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance a User who is at San Lazaro bustop but wants to travel to Tenayuca will see her route immediately along with information's regarding Metrobus Arrival &amp; Departure time. Because Mexico City Users needs to know how long it will take her to reach her destination. I implored
                    <b>
                        Haversine Equation
                    </b>
                    to calculate the distance between two locations.For example the traveling distance between San Lazaro to Tacubaya  can be expressed in
                    <b>
                        Miles, Nautic Miles, Kilometers, Meters, Yards and Feets
                    </b>
                    using mathematical computation of
                    <b>
                        Haversine Formula
                    </b>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    For every Bustop and Routes, the app displays all the Mexico City Users who has already booked Seat that Day and who also like traveling on that route on daily basis. To board on, you have to clicks on
                    <b>
                        Book a Seat.
                    </b>
                    The app will automatically generate a seat number for
each  user with which she can use to enter the bus when Metrobus arrives. This eliminate any struggles for the seat and the 
sitting on Metrobus Transit will be based on first come first serve. Upon each seat booking, the app sends an SMS notifications
to Metrobus transit Agency to Inform them that a User just booked a seat from any particular Bustop that is being served
by Metrobus Agency.

Mexico City Users who for example is at Ethiopia bustop could be able to predict:
