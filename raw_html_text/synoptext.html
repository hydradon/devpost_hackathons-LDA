                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to allow people around the world who do not have access to internet to have a chance to learn about different topics using text messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to send a text message about a topic and receive a synopsis of a few sentences based on the audio of the Youtube videos of that is relevant to the topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Synopotext was built in Node.js using the Nexmo, Youtube-dl, and AYLIEN text API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of problems with what tools we could or could not use. For example, we could not find a way to extract captions from Youtube videos, so we had to instead extract the audio from Youtube videos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the process of developing Synopotext, we ran through a lot of challenges in terms of bridging the gap between each of the APIs used. We feel really successful that through the process of integrating all these APIs, we were able to both learn more about the APIs themselves and gain a lot of knowledge during the research process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize callbacks in Node JS effectively to link different API calls in the correct order so that the data from each of the API&rsquo;s would be used correctly by the next API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for synoptext
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to implement more flexibility for the types of messages Synoptext can receive from users. For example, we want users to be able to type their messages in a sentence format and with Natural Language Processing (NLP), be able to further optimize the resulting summary.
