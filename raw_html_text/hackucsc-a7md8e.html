                    DigitalNest Org.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goal: To make an app that helps the staff of the Digital Nest communicate with the youth [not just an app that will be downloaded once at registration, but an app they will choose to use]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ways they want to communicate with our users:
By informing them about events based on what they CHOOSE to be informed about and how far away they want the events to be from the [they will receive push notifications when there are new events]
Having a chat with different staff members anonymously (you get to choose which staff member you would like to communicate with by clicking on their picture)
Surveys to help bridge the gap between organizers and the attendees
Rewards to help keep attendees engaged while being informed and the most up to date events
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also incorporated Pyze to get data about our users. With this information, we planned to do personalization where we can alter the app according to our user. For example, if one of our users is a 12 year old that is always active after school ends, we would set notifications to remind him right after school  that he could reach level 2 with 2 more stars, encouraging him to participate in using the app as well as giving the organization feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our design, we had features that would help make using the app more engaging. We were working on a feature where we could swipe on events that are being held by the organization. This is because swiping is a simple and fun feature that can make informing the youth about events much easier. However due to time constraints, we ended up throwing out ideas like these to create a simpler version of the app that achieves our goals.

                    As we are first time hackers, we spent majority of the time building up our own database using firebase. None of us have ever worked with databases so as it was our first time, it was a pretty big struggle. However, we managed to have the database working where the people who sign up have their information stored on our database. Also, using the database, we build a chat application. For the events portion of our app, we attempted to use the database to filter the events out in particular to the categories selected, however that was another great struggle and we were unable to finish on time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although our app is incomplete as of right now, if we were given at least two more days, we would've been able to bring our vision alive.
