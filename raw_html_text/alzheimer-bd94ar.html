                    AlzheimeR is an exploratory project into designing an augmented reality application to assist those living with AlzheimeR remember important information. The application seeks to improve and streamline the lifestyle changes and challenges list by the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association.

                    Applications like Timeless has showcased how technology can greatly benefit those diagnosed with Alzheimer. Therefore this nwHack2018, our team decided to build an application that goes beyond what was created before. Venturing into new languages, APIs, and frameworks, our team decided to create this application on a platform we all have no experience in. IOS. AlzheimeR was the result of our combined endeavour.

                <p>
                    Although still in its early stages, AlzheimeR is an excellent start to explore the use of augmented reality and mental health. Currently, it is able to pin different location in the real world. It also includes the ability to assign a photo and a title to these locations. This is one of the features we wanted to complete our proof of concept. This is because it is important and at times vital to remember certain locations. The ability to remember where you live, or where the doctor offices are or even your child's home greatly improves ones independent in the face of such challenges such as Alzheimer.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, due to time constraints, features such as facial and object recognition were tested or explored but never fully integrated into the application. However, a demonstration of object recognition using ARKit and MobileNet machines learning model was created to explore the idea of not only tagging location but also being able to tag objects.  Therefore hopefully in the future, objects such as medicine or loved ones can be tag/identifiable and have a description attached to them.
