                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To intertwine the technologies of web development, embedded systems, and mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It starts off with the mobile application, that uses OCR to parse your grocery receipt to pass to the web to look for recipes based on what you bought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It then sends recipes back to the mobile application, so it can forward the recipe the user selected, to the recipe scouter to instruct the user on how to cook the recipe, hands free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a website, android mobile application, and physically built a scouter with an arduino, 3D printed parts, mirror lens and plastic film.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get everything to function separately but unfortunately we did not have enough time for them to communicate with each other. In addition, the AWS free service did not get back to us so we were not able to use their services for our website. We were not able to get a physical receipt of a grocery list, so we used a Digital Ocean card instead to demo the functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to get that much work finished in a given allotted time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned alot about different technologies and how to manage time more efficiently. We also learned ham + turkey subways sandwiches is the best.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Recipe Scouter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to have them completely communicate with each other
