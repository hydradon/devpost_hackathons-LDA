                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for Roots to STEM stems from our team members own experiences. There have been times when we have been discouraged and told that we should not pursue a career in STEM presumably because we are women. Our goal is to not only encourage girls and young women to think about a career in STEM, but to also given them role models and mentors that will inspire them and more importantly get them excited about a career in IT. We also seek to keep our users connected to resource and scholarships, particularly the underprivilaged and underrepresented students, thereby making STEM education accesible to all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roots to STEM matches girls and young women to a mentor in their area, largely based on their interests and career goals, as well as their answers to a survey that they take after signing up for the site. Roots to STEM also includes a comprehensive and updated list of scholarships that are avalible as well as bootcamps, carrer fairs, and other STEM related events, particularly those geared towards women.

                <h2>
                    How We Built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build the website, we took a  bootstrap template and tweaked it to fit our design goals. For the mentor to mentee connection area of the website, we took the code from an opensource dating website and altered it to allow users to search for compatible mentoring relationships. The code was largely done in HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript. While the databases were already complete, there was a degree of coding required to get the Bootstrap template to match the mentoring connection portion.

                <h2>
                    Challenges That We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the challenges we faced were on the backend of the website. It was difficult to configure the server to handle the mySQL database given all of the information that was being passed to it. This was especially challenging given the fact that none of the team had any significant database experience.
