                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration comes from observation we've got during our analysis on twitter stream when we observed hat there are thousands of people talking about different causes, but not many of them manage to donate at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Consequently, we want to create a bridge between people that are truly wanting to donate and charity campaings available via JustGiving API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it using machine learning algorithms combined with data extraction and front end frameworks suchs as AngularJS and HTML/CSS JQuerry
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Angular was one challenge whne we had to connect with the JustGivingAPI . Another challenge was the fact that many many tweets were not geo-tagged.

                <p>
                    accomplishments  included the prioritizing of tweets to get hold of sensitive topics around the world.
