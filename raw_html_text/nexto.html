                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are rethinking an organising tools for event holders and make information about events more assessable for all Reykjav&iacute;k visitors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built in three ways, first it help tourist and locals to find events nearby that are happening. It helps event holders to share their events to locals and tourist and especially to those that don&rsquo;t have smart phone. 
Furthermore it helps event holders to manage their infrastructure and keep event history in good place. 
Finally it lead the tourist/local through Reykjavik city to the event that they want to see and explore.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is one database with multiple connection
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did a market research and found out is that it is hard to have access to all information about all new and updated events happening right now from event holders. More attention and accessibility is needed to smaller pop up events  then the bigger events.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How well we were able to see our project involve through the entire time, and how deep we got in to Icelandic culture. We saw that there are many things in Iceland that tourist are not able to see and its nice to be able to make a solution to help tourist to see all the best of Iceland.
