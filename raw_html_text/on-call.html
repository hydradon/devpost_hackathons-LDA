                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first few seconds of an accident are critical. The sooner an injured person gets the care they need, the better their chance of survival. Too many people have lost their lives because the traffic on the interstate was dense. This application can help people in need get basic emergency first aid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides emergency instructions so that a person in need can have access to life-saving help. This can be of use to any person in need. People who are alone can receive instructions on the self-Heimlich. Parents or babysitters can perform CPR on infants and children.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    built in OS applications for speech to text and text to speech.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent a long time trying to make this on Alexia. It was hard to scrap my whole project so I could rework it in c++;
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    terminal commands and bash. I have never used it before and I really like it.

                    What's next for On Call
                </h2>
                <p>
                    adding more keywords and more emergencies. I wanted to add instructions for epi pens and minor injuries.
