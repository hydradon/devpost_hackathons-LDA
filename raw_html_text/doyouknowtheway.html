                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IBM had a coding challenge using their ibm-watson APIs. We wanted to make use of their API to make an application to help people with visually difficulties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By taking a picture on the android app, the app will analyze it and read out the information back through text to speech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio as our main platform. We implemented IBM's Visual Recognition API and their Text-to-speech API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn from scratch android studio and how to use iBM's APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished what we wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a simple app using android studio and how to implement APIs.
