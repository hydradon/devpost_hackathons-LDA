                    Parking on campus sucks. We wanted to try to find a way to alleviate the pain of trying to find a spot on campus. After a lot of talking and debating we decided on developing a mobile app.

                    Essentially, our app, Find My Spot, allows users to see all of empty spots on campus and quickly find a place to park.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using several different technologies, some of which are: Firebase, Javascript,Node.js,Python,Arduino,Putty,Android Studios and a few more technologies. The arduino is using an HC-SR04 sonic sensor to detect the distance between the sound emitter and an object up to 7cm ahead of it. This is then put into a Python script which reads the file continuously and updates an output file towards firebase, where the data is then stored until it is read by the application we made for Android using Android studios.

                    Interfacing the arduino with the sound sensor, getting dependencies for python, android studios, and the arduino

                    Fixing the issues we ran into above, and using the HC-SR04 to read and write data to Putty terminals that read indefinitely, successfully creating the app container
