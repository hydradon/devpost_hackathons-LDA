                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My goal was to create a game using Unreal Engine, although it turned into making my own game from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created a demo level, with different building materials that allows a player to build a custom building.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built using C++ and OpenGL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge I was unable to overcome was managing to get Unreal Engine work on my poor little Macbook. Technically, my hardest challenge was surprisingly putting roofs on the buildings. It turned out to be a really tough algorithmic problem. Artistically, I was unable to add crowds of inhabitants, or creatures, without the power of a game engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that a player can actually build something :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always come prepared!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for shelter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With an engine of sorts built for it, there is oodles of contents to still be made!
                </p>
