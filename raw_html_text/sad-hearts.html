                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friend J. Collins and I decided to create a social media website but with a sort of twist to it. We decided to limit the posting time and this is what we came up with
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is just a starter page that gives you a link to (although not yet) sign up or log in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Notepad++ to write out the code and used w3 school's guides to css and html to help me remember how to make it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I could not figure out how to change the "Join Now" link to yellow
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made two different sites for the first time and managed to slightly edit and link them together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've only tapped into the basics of coding and learned of html and css
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sad Hearts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will try to get into contact with my team to see if we can develop this further.
