                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be able to provide a decentralised network with managing medical records where the patient has full ownership to whom their data gets transferred to. Since the medical industry is huge and has the likelihood of sensitive data being exposed to third party, it is important to use the block chain technology to keep the data as authenticated as possible. This could potentially help the NHS, a government run health service , prevent data leakage fines as they did back in 2018.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is essentially used to come with a solution on how block chain technology can be used in supporting Alice from the #AAA challenge. As we have solely focused on more of the back-end algorithm we ensured that the application does the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Create a file containing prescription information and assign it to patient Alice
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transfer it to Dr Eve
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can Allow Dr Eve to add notes (metadata)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transfer Ownership back to Alice.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The front-end section of the application outline briefly how this would come together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end was build using html and css to give the look and feel of each component of the web application/website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The back-end was programmed using nodejs alognside the TODAQ API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since most of us were recent graduates and nodejs was a new framework to be learned we struggled synchronising the back-end algorithm with the front-end interface
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make use of nodejs as much as possible with no prior experience in it and able to execute this within 24hours. Also, most us are not expert in Blockchain technology and were able to learn the concept at a fast rate which we are all proud of.
                </p>
