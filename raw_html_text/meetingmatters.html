                <p>
                    Many companies now are embracing more telecommuters and remote workers, who will all require an easy to use video conference application. However, online video or voice conferences often feel cumbersome and ineffective. Often these meetings extend past their estimated time due to unprepared members who take too long to convey their important issues. _ MeetingMatters _ aims to improve the efficiency of virtual meetings, and increase the amount of content per unit time shared.

                <p>
                    Inspired by a team member's industry experience managing teams, _ MeetingMatters _ allows managers to set the overall time of the meeting _ and _ allocate a defined amount of speaking time to each member. Timing of the meeting and of meeting members is now the responsibility of _ MeetingMatters _, and not the team members themselves. This will motivate users to come prepared to the meeting, and present a concise content-heavy speech.
