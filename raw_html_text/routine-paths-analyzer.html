                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the last years, all of us faced issues while changing the different services we use, such as while moving from Apple Music to Spotify. Even after GDPR was introduced, we still don't have total access to our data and even if we do, we don't know how to use it efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea is to create a SaaS that transfers your data for you between platforms in order to avoid losing your history, empower the recommendation systems of services and make switching platforms easy and possible within a few clicks. 
We decided to showcase our idea by using data from Google Maps in order to extract the CO2 emissions we, as individuals, are responsible for, show how our daily paths to and from work can be improved in order to save time, as well as the number of calories you can burn daily by choosing a different mean of transport.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use the programming skills that we have within the team and we split the work accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The brainstorming process was long and intense, which made us try different brainstorming techniques. Despite the fact that it took us a while to come up with this idea, from the moment we found it, the process of dividing the tasks and implementing the solution was pleasant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to underline the fact that our implementation is just a small part of our vision. We have an innovative idea and we consider continuing with it after the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that diversity in terms of background, skills, and mentality is extremely important and valuable when it comes to any kind of teamwork. In this kind of context, the brainstorming process can be longer, however, more ideas are generated and the implementation itself is more efficient considering the skills we had inside the team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for routine paths analyzer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to determine if it worth continuing with our idea and maybe create a startup.
