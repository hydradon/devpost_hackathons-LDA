                    Inspiration: After becoming disillusioned with the US Political and Financial systems, I had given up and was checked out. I didn't want to fight in a losing battle and never wanted to be a freedom fighter. But when I learned about Bitcoin, I knew this new technology would give us the tool we need to fight back, to get our edge, not by power or force, but by peacefully Opting Out of the system. And I went on a mission to tell as many people about it as possible. But not about the money, not about the tech, but about the revolution, the change that Bitcoin can help make to the world.

                    What's next for Bitcoins Is The Spark: This is actually cut from a 2.5 min short video, and the plan was to run this, and try to get support to turn it into a 3-5 part short series, set in the future, showing the power of what bitcoin and blockchain technology could achieve
