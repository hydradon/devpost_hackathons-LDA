                    To be honest, we started off with no clue as to what we were going to make, but what we did know is that we wanted to create something with a meaningful and everlasting effect that we could see ourselves using in our own daily lives as busy college students. This is when we started to look at the problems in our own lives for inspiration and realized that
                    <strong>
                        food security
                    </strong>
                    and

                    </strong>
                    were some of the issues that we dealt with passively and had not taken the time to recognize. As students, we often
                    <em>
                        forget to eat
                    </em>
                    after a long day at school, complain about the
                    <em>
                        spoiled milk
                    </em>
                    we left in the fridge and forgot to drink, talk about how we made
                    <em>
                        too much pasta
                    </em>
                    last night for one person to eat, or simply hear the rumbles of our stomach and
                    <em>
                        go hungry
                    </em>
                    because we can&rsquo;t afford to eat. We wanted to create a food app, but
                    <strong>
                        not just not any food app,
                    </strong>
                    a food app that could reduce waste, combat hunger, and of course, make sure we wouldn&rsquo;t get

                    from that yellow gallon of chunky slush in &ldquo;MyFridge.&rdquo;

                    is a

                    component that uses

                        IBM Watson recognition integration.
                    </em>
                    The app itself opens up to a list of food categories that the user can select depending on what they are interested in looking for. Within each food category is a
                    <em>
                        community feed
                    </em>
                    where other users are welcome to post food that they no longer want and is still in edible condition as well as provide users who are in need of a cup of milk or a meal with a network where they are free to ask for food
                    <em>
                        without having to pay a cent.
                    </em>
                    In this way, we are reducing the amount of perfectly edible food that ends up in our landfills every year and we are helping make strides toward the
                    <em>
                        fight against hunger.

                    </strong>
                    We looked for ways in which we could take our idea to the next level in order to really tackle the issue and make this as easy of a process for our users as possible. We wanted to use the
                    <em>
                        IBM Watson API
                    </em>
                    in combination with the
                    <em>
                        Android Camera API
                    </em>
                    in order to source data for our food and reduce the amount of work that the user would have to input every time they used the
                    <em>
                        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in MyFridge?&rdquo;
                    </em>
                    food record. The user would take a picture of any given food and Watson would provide us with information on the
                    <em>
                        kind of food
                    </em>
                    that was being captured, the
                    <em>
                        name of the food,
                    </em>
                    and the
                    <em>
                        expiration date.
                    </em>
                    The app would then use this information to
                    <em>
                        create alerts
                    </em>
                    and inform the user of

                        soon-to-be expired food.
                    </em>
                    With these alerts, the user could then make the decision to either eat the food or
                    <em>
                        post

                    In our attempt to use the Watson API, we could not get it to properly work the way we wanted it so we moved onto our camera component so we could at least have that. However, that also wasn&rsquo;t a

                    We could not select the captured picture in order to move onto the next activity, our
