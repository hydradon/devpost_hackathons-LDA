                    And, we believe that
                    <strong>
                        Apache Spark
                    </strong>
                    is a robust framework for data analytics and can support business decisions effectively. We wanted to showcase what Spark can do for businesses, using
                    <strong>
                        machine learning algorithms

                    Propensity models, also called likelihood to purchase or response models, help predict the likelihood of a certain type of customer behavior and purchase patterns. This helps marketers optimize marketing strategies like promotional email/app notification frequency, discounts or offers/campaigns.
