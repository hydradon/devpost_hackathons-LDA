                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The realization that most of us do not know our neighbors and are missing an opportunity to participate in a rich community
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website that allows people to join and create communities. This allows community members to make announcements, plan events and in the future, creating change through funding community projects and signing petitions.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We expanded on our limited knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript to challenge ourselves to create a website from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating Javascript to display user entered text. It was difficult to create code to accomplish this task without knowing much about the syntax and functionality of Javascript. We overcame this by asking mentors for help, watching videos and reading online forum posts

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the webpage design. We are also proud of being able to embed a Google calendar into our website. We are excited that we created a product to demo at our first Technica

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there are many better options for programming than Notepad++. We also learned about Javascript HTML DOM and adding ids to elements.
