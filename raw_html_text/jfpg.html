                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frustration with GPG's ridiculous complexity. Also inspired by last year's project, but written totally from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JFPG attempts to be a very small, simplified replacement for GPG, but with modern crypto.
It currently does encryption, decryption, signing, and verification. It uses Ed25519, Curve25519 and Xsalsa20-Poly1305 as its crypto primitives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Tweetnacl, a very small crypto library written by Dan Bernstein. This means that JFPG doesn't require any dependencies to compile and run on Unix. Everything it needs is in the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote this on OpenBSD, so portability with Linux is a pain because glibc doesn't include many secure C functions that OpenBSD has. All of these had to be provided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It covers the basics of GPG/PGP, but uses much less code, much more secure ciphers, and a better source of random numbers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to fix lots of little memory handling issues and write more portable C code.
                </p>

                    What's next for JFPG
