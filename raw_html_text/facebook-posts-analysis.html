                    There are a lot of crappy posts on Facebook. There needed to be a way to check if your last couple posts were actually engaging people more than normal or just boring the people around. Enter Facebook Analytics.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It checks your last 100 Facebook posts to find the average likes and comments per post. Then it displays your Facebook posts to you and shows you what is doing above average and what is below average.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python and the Graph API from Facebook to set it up and pull all the post information. After that, I set up a quick Python GUI to display the information and make it look all pretty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally I was hoping to have it set up with Facebook OAuth on the web so that people could log in and check their own information, but I had a lot of trouble getting it up and running, so it's just set up on a Python GUI.
                </p>

                    What's next for Facebook Posts Analysis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Would like to originally get it up and running on the web so that people can check their own post history.
