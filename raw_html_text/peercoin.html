                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to experiment with lightweight nodes that could contribute to a blockchain. I decided on making the project for iOS because I have not heard of such a project before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to initialize a new blockchain, join an existing blockchain, mine new coins, and view their wallet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using swift and testing the network via my phone and virtual iphones which can be run through xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to make sure the blockchain was always synced between devices. I also had a really tough time trying to learn how to make the UI , so I eventually decided to focus on backend functionality instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was going to initially create this project in a more traditional way, using python and raspberry pi's. I'm proud that I was able to get this prototype up and running for mobile, and able to overcome some roadblocks along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to program in swift, and learned a lot more about what goes into a peer to peer network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PeerCoin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would really like to make the UI better, since it is very rudimentary. I would also like to implement more rigorous cryptography, include more metadata, and implement transactions.
