                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While studying Japanese, I found that there were a lack of good apps that were useful for practicing the Kanji, which can otherwise be difficult to practice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to generate symbols which can then be used as templates to practice writing. The user simply draws their symbol and selects create, then they can practice and receive a grade on how well this symbol was written in regards to the original.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, primarily with Kotlin, to develop the structures to store each character as they are input, then compare new inputs to saved templates.
                </p>

                    The user drawn input is displayed similarly to a fountain pen.
