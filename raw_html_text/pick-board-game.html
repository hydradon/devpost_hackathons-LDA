                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every thursday night when my friend group meetup, we always spend at least 10 minutes or more debating which is a good boardgame to play for the night. Because we have varying number of people in the room each time and we don't know which board games we own and how many players each game can support, we always waste time on this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets me enter boardgames I own and the maximum number of players each can support to and an accompanying command line tool that lets me enter number of players I have and randomly suggest a game for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Google Cloud Firestore as the database and backend. I used a pure JS webapp for the data entry webtool and a python tool that reads data from the Firestore database and randomize the results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time I was using cloud firestore so it was a bit of a challenge understanding the data modeling but the docs were pretty helpful. I also didn't know how to take in cli arguments before but it was solved fairly quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I learned how to use a tool that I just learned by attending the workshop and solving an actual problem that I have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned Firestore Modelling, NoSQL data storage, writing queries. I also learned how to use different languages for just one project (I have not done that quite before).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pick Board Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to implement Firebase Authentication for the webapp so that my friends can log in with their emails and enter the games they own as well so there is some form of verification for our database.
