                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to integrate the twilio API into a game to allow for some great audience participation!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a roguelike game with a procedurally generated level. Users can interact with the game via SMS to help, or hinder, the player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Git, we had constant merge conflicts and our changes rarely persisted. We lost a lot of progress and wasted a lot of time just fixing issues entirely caused by Git, and rewriting code we've already written.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proud of the framework that was set up. Roguelikes are notoriously data-driven, and hardcoding values everywhere would be very bad for extendability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That Unity &amp; Git don't go well together!
