                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration mostly came from our own studies. We write all our assignments in LaTeX and have found it cumbersome to input especially math.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a voice input of different standard math functions and converts it to LaTeX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We separated the work into two parts, so one worked on the speech to LaTeX part of it and the other build a website and a Flask backend to host it all. Then we glued it all together. We do not recommend this approach since it can give some headaches
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to put in a few safeguards to ensure issues like the speech-api returning "to" when we ment "2". We also had a file conversation issue since our frontend recorded audio in .ogg file format and we could only make the speech-api accept .flac formats. We spend a long time looking for different python libraries that solved this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! (..mostly) It also looks really pretty. Mostly we are quite happy that everything came together relatively easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google-speech, Flask, File conversation, Bootstrap and we need to get better at escape rooms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tex-Speech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More features and more robust parsing.
                </p>
