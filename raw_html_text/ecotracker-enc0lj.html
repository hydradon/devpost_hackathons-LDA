                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people want to make a difference in the environment but do not know how. One of the major reasons why there have not been many substantial efforts towards protecting the environment is a lack of information and understanding of one's impact. Although this app will not fix the environment, it will educate individuals of their impact, hopefully motivating positive change.

                    It tracks how much Carbon a person releases on a daily basis. A user can input the food they eat, the miles they drive, and the electricity that was used. The site displays a graph detailing emmission history per day.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used flask for the backend, aws to host the server, and html/css/js for the front end.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulties hosting the server and creating a graph out of our data.

                <p>
                    We were able to complete the app in time.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Flask and host a server on AWS.

                    What's next for Ecotracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to improve the front end to look more aesthetically pleasing and add more functionality such as more specific types of food, transportation, and life style decisions. Additionally, we would like to allow users to make accounts and compare their carbon impact with friends. We would like users to be able to set carbon emission goals and participate and competitions that reward them for having the lowest emissions.
