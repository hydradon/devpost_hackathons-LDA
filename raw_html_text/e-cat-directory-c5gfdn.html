                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most likely the current directory are dull and not easy to read. So we are making a directory with ai to provide a better experience for customer in a mall.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It includes an AI chat bot to provide a more interactive and multi language support directory for  customer to shop more conveniently, and business wise, it can provide a better platform to promote and advertise.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used azure web bot to build the chat bot that can answer the customer. By answering customer, it will provide a suggestion which can also be used in advertising. Data will be collected according to the emotion and the clothing of the customer to provide the best promotion effect.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The chat bot is very difficult to deploy, we tried the whole night and the latest version can not be loaded in to the web app. Luckily, we got luck in the morning and finished the job.
