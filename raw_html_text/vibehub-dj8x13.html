                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every day thousands of people write articles on websites like theodysseyonline.com and medium.com which no one will ever read. We want to reduce this huge amount of "screaming into the void" and focus on producing content people are actually interested in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VibeHub allows users to submit blurbs and titles for articles they plan to write, then allow users to vote on whether they'd be interested in reading the full article if written. If a blurb/title hits a requiste number of likes, then the content creator gets a publication slot. The content is then relayed to all the people who originally asked for the article, thereby greatly increasing the readership and impact of the content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using flask, mysql, and other web development tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had much experience with web development before and none of us had ever done anything involving databases, so figuring all that out was a big struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of the fact that we got our databases to work and actually created a website that functions, seeing as none of us had really done anything like this before (with minor extremely simple exceptions).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use mySQL, flask, and pretty much everything else we actually did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VibeHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to polish the platform, make it work, and focus on improving the security.
