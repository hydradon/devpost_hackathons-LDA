                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the simple mazes with rolling balls. We wanted to combine our interests of hardware and software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The maze is connected to the step motor and can tilt left or right. An Android app controls the motor through Bluetooth connection with the Raspberry Pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed the Android app using Android Studio. The Raspberry Pi contains a Python module that searches for Bluetooth connections using a UUID. The step motor is connected to a shield that connects with the GPIO pins on the raspberry pi. The phone pairs to the Raspberry Pi using Bluetooth connection and the Android app has 2 buttons that control the motor when pressed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the best way to send data from the app to the Pi was a challenge because there were so many choices. We tried IR blaster, then cloud service, and finally Bluetooth. However, we were unable to establish a successful connection from our app. Given more time, we could probably solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to put together the hardware and the maze. We were able to connect to Bluetooth with a third party app, which was pretty exciting. In our own Android app, we were able to create working buttons and we almost got the Bluetooth to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained some experience with Android Studio, Raspberry Pi, and BlueTerm. We learned about Bluetooth connections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hardware Maze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could work on getting the app to work, and once we do that, we can make a better maze out of better materials. We can also improve the UI of the app.
