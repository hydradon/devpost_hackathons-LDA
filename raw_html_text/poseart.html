                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discovered the library PoseNet not too long ago and it seemed like an amazing tool to be creative. So for this hackathon we prioritized creativity rather than sophisticated looking algorithms. We wanted to learn, create and have fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game aims to replicate the experience of Pictionary. Make your friends try to guess your drawings! But this app does not require pen, paper or even a touchscreen! Only a camera (webcam) and your hands! By moving your hand in front of the camera, PoseNet detects its position and we mapped these to actual drawings. Plus, you can play with your friends online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript for the mapping. HTML, CSS for the web app and Firebase to keep the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make the drawings more precise since PoseNet ML was not that efficient at identifying and tracking wrist movements
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The style of the web app (for the designer it was her first time working with HTML and CSS), and that we greatly improved the accuracy of the drawings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, CSS, PoseNet library, JavaScript (different for each teammate)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PoseArt!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More interactive activities, colours, and maybe an adventure mode! Also, we want users to be able to share their chef d'oeuvres on Instagram, Facebook and Tumblr. (Maybe even add a ML algorithm that would try to guess your drawings.)
