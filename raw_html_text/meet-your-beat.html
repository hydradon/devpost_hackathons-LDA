                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students who listen to music to help with our productivity, we wanted to not only create a music sharing application but also a website to allow others to discover new music, all through where they are located. We were inspired by Pokemon-Go but wanted to create a similar implementation with music for any user to listen to. Anywhere. Anytime.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meet Your Beat implements a live map where users are able to drop "beats" (a.k.a Spotify beacons). These beacons store a song on the map, allowing other users to click on the beacon and listen to the song. Using location data, users will be able to see other beacons posted around them that were created by others and have the ability to "tune into" the beacon by listening to the song stationed there. Multiple users can listen to the same beacon to simulate a "silent disco" as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first customized the Google Map API to be hosted on our website, as well as fetch the Spotify data for a beacon when a user places their beat. We then designed the website and began implementing the SQL database to hold the user data.

                    Challenges I ran into

                    <li>
                        Having limited experience with Javascript and API usage
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hosting our domain through Google Cloud, which we were unaccustomed to

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is very proud of our ability to merge various elements for our website, such as the SQL database hosting the Spotify data for other users to access on the website. As well, we are proud of the fact that we learned so many new skills and languages to implement the API's and database
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a variety of new skills and languages to help us gather the data to implement the website. Despite numerous challenges, all of us took away something new, such as web development, database querying, and API implementation
