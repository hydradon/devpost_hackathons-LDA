                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Volunteered as a tax preparer for a free tax preparation organization for individual who meet certain requirements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is to digitize and crowdsource the tax preparation industry this service is for everyone they can join the network and contribute to a community where everyone has the same opportunity to grow their wealth with cryptocurrency. Essentially the people who are looking to have there taxes done and certified volunteer tax preparers on the network. A contract is initiated when a prepares does someones taxes 1% of that person refund is pooled in the network for everyone so that BitCoin can bought and then the gains can be distributed to everyone.
