                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people on campus had their bikes stolen earlier this Summer. This seems like a decent plan to help mitigate bike theft, especially in bigger cities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a small receiver that you drop into your bike frame that checks in periodically with our server. If your bike was stolen, you can have it update more often and lead you to your bike.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Tornado for the server, Twilio for GSM comms, and an Android app to emulate the arduino which was missing some crucial components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the shields I'd reserved for Arduino (GSM, as well as the GPS antenna) weren't available from the hardware shop; I improvised with an Android app made in a few hours, but it still needed a reworking of the hardware registration handshake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a mostly-working infrastructure and creating a first Android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Twilio API, the Arduino GPS shield's C library, and how to make an Android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BikeTrack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Miniaturization, an actual device validation plan that works with Arduino, and a more robust registration system.
                </p>
