                <p>
                    Child Labor is worst in every form. It's not a secret that child labor exists on an extensive scale in Pakistan. It directly targets a Child&rsquo;s Future for worst. It not only snatches Childhood but also causes damages to his health. 
Denying children their fundamental right to be educated between the ages of five to 16 exposes them to health hazards, hampers their development and puts them at risk to other forms of violence, which may also be physical and psychological. 
So, In this era of Technological Development, it&rsquo;s necessary to find solutions which combat this Problem.

                <p>
                    The Governmental laws are very strict but we see a very less implementation. 
In 1999, the ILO(International Labor Organization) led the Worst Forms Convention, signed by 151 countries, which prohibits the worst forms of child labor such as:
Debt Bondage Child Trafficking All forms of Slavery or Slavery-like practices Forced Recruitment of Children in Armed Conflict Prostitution Production of Pornography Drug Production and Trafficking Any Hazardous Work

                <p>
                    &bull; Pakistan Ranks at No. # 3 in the world with the highest presence of child and forced labor
&bull; About 15 million Children are experiencing the child labor, which makes 7% of the total population of Pakistan. 
&bull; There is a 4-Fold increase in child labor in Pakistan in the past 20 years. 
&bull; Persistence of child labor through Ages
