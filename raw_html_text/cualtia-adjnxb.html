                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many grocery stores from large chains that are affecting our local shops and also to many mexican families that depend of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are looking for a solution for this problem. That is the main reason of why was
                    <strong>
                        CUALTIA
                    </strong>
                    developed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        CUALTIA
                    </strong>
                    is a tool for our local stores, which brings access to technology, management and cheaper fees for products, we thrive to make of the family-ran corner shop a real competitor against major grocery store chains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used different tools: Android, php, bluemix, json, sql, java, adobe illustrator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we found some troubles of how the payments logistics was going to work. It also was a challenge bringing motivation to a traditional market and a little informal to do deposits, transfers, electronic payment or in another way to guarantee security of the values in case that the pay up it's realized at the delivery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays we count with strategic alliances from one distribution company with more than 20 years on the food market of Guadalajara better known as "Mercado de Abastos" and also two manufacturing companies that wants to be part of the program (all this with only one diffusion week). At the same time we already have two drivers who want to participate as distribution partners of the commodity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many families have as principal livelihood a grocery store and when we approached them they really like the idea of having technological tools that allow them to compete against stores from large chains in all the ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cualtia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First to create delivery routes, contact partners and get more strategic partners.
As a second phase we want to create a sale point that allows to offer more services and have a better administration for those grocery stores.
Finally count with a training team which will visit the registered shops, to propose to them a certification as a model store.
