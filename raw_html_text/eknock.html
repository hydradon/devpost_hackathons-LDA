                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental health is an issue coming to the forefront of society. According to CAMH, Canada loses $51 billion due to health care costs, reductions in health-related quality of life, and lost in productivity.
Our app, eKnock, was created to reduce this burden by using music to help identify and express ones emotions. It also provides a link to the Canadian Mental Health Association's website so that the user can seek help if need be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    eKnock prompts users to have a quick conversation. The app then analyzes the content of the converstaion and determines the users mood. Based off of this mood, it recommends a song on Spotify and sends a link to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app in Android Studio. The speech-to-text feature was a preexisting feature in Android Studio. 
We used IBM Watson to analyze the tone of the text. To calculate a valence value, which is how positive or negative a song is (a rating between 0.0 - 1.0), we devised an algorithm using the mood and the intensity value of the mood outputted by the API.
To use the Spotify Recommendations api, we first needed to authenticate the app and then the user. The app was authenticated on Spotify's developer dashboard, and the user signs into Spotify to start the app. The valence value is used to get the link to a song from the Spotify Recommendations api. The user can go to the song by clicking a button on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like with most hackathons, implementing our APIs was the greatest challenge: specifically, the Spotify authentication apis. In order to get an authentication token, we had to generate a code that would generate and authentication token and a refresh token.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eKnock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From a technical standpoint, we would like to have an embedded Spotify audio player. In addition, eKnock could prompt the user with questions based off of their mood and verbally respond back. We also wish to utilize voice and speech pattern sentiment analysis to analyze the mood more accurately. Finally, we would like to refine the Spotify recommendation search by including more parameters, upon further research. 
Additionally, we would like to do more research into AI so that eKnock can also help alleviate mental illness by being a friend that supports the user and caters to their needs based off of the mood analysis.
