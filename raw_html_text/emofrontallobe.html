                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Human communication is a
                    <strong>
                        complex and powerful
                    </strong>
                    process. A thought or a feeling, shaped by the mental state of the person, translated into the language she speaks, and transmitted over a variety of media. To empower communication is to strength all parts of this process. Our goal is to prove how neuroscience and machine learning can improve the quality of our day to day communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We focus on leveraging two aspects to directly aid the communication -
                    <strong>
                        subtle brain context
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        natural language processing
                    </strong>
                    . In addition, this tool also incorporates real time speech to text and multi-language translation to facilitate communication in an increasingly globalized world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The audio data is recorded and converted to text to allow translation and sentimental analysis. Brain waveform of the communicator was measured by a Muse headband. This rich data was then processed with averaging techniques and frequency filtering to determine lethargic and active mental states. The sentiments of the message, couple with the mindset of the communicator, give a rich context to to the message conveyed. We demonstrate this by selecting specific emojis to best represent the tone of the message and the mental state of the speaker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The single greatest challenge is interfacing among many different pieces of technologies. From the Muse band to the sentimental analysis toolkit to build web-based tools on IBM BlueMix, it was not trivial to determine the most efficient way to move data from stage to stage and enable the integrated functionalities. We are able to conquer the challenge because of the diverse backgrounds of the team members from Computer Science, Information Management, and Electrical Engineering, with expertise in areas from hardware, neuroscience, and backend and frontend dev.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an equal representation of both genders in our team! We have a first time hacker! We come from four different cities across US and began working as a tightly knitted team instantly. We all worked on something new for the first time during this project and learned tons!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fancy new gadgets are also finicky to work with.
Project planning and delegation are the most important step of a hackathon project.
Always take on a task we have not done before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EmoFrontalLobe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will refine our system and improve the integration of interfacing technologies. We strongly believe the most advanced technologies is only useful when they can benefit the most ubiquitous needs. We look forward to launch a mobile based tool enabled by our system as the new means of communication.
