                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our interest in ways for citizens to be politically active.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It educates people on referendums and how to create them. It also allows canvassers to find areas where there are people who are willing to support them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a website on GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a considerable amount of time learning how to implement a Google map in a website, and a larger amount of time learning how to use Django. We were inable to implement Django.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We succeeded in implementing a map in the website, and when the map is clicked on the location is marked. We also could not get Django to work, so in the last few minutes of the hackathon, we switched to a JavaScript-based solution for our Referendum page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use API's. We also learned that it would be better to start at the beginning of the Hackathon by listing what we needed to do, as we didn't and then were forced to begin learning Django later. We also learned how to adapt our plans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Take Initiative
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to further implement server-side coding in Django so that we can save values to Django. We would also like canvassers to be able to see which specific initiatives have support in which areas.
