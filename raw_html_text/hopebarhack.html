                <p>
                    Our hack involves two components: a native iOS application designed for users who wish to advocate EMSquared's Hope bars, and a mobile website written with jQuery to bypass the hassle of app downloads and account setups for buyers. The iOS app involves three main components. The selling interface provides easy-to-use buttons for sellers to push to their friends, leveraging many main channels of social networking like email and text message. The "My profile" page tracks users' statistics since the inception of their account, including how many Hope bars they've sold to-date and a live score of their accumulated profits from the sales. This also offers the option to donate your profits or transfer earnings to a bank account. The most rewarding feature on the profile page is a map which drops pins at locations where your sold bars have been sent; this enables sellers to visualize the reach of their impact and encourage them to continue spreading the Hope!
