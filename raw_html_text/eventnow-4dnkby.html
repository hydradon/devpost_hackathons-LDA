                    From giving off vibes of being socially dead to seeing many people sitting in their dorms/suites doing nothing, it was clear that we needed something to help students get out there more not only academically but socially too. That's why we decided to come up with EventNow. It is a realtime pinging system for local events, such as on-campus. Clubs and organizations can input events and information about that event from a website we created. This website takes that data and shows all the events on a map not only on a desktop but also on a mobile app. We even added functions such as searching for events you would be interested in with keywords or choosing a random event to go to.
