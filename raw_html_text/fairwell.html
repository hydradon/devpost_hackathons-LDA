                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As busy, broke, and inexperienced college students, we often don't have time or don't know where to look for the best flights home for breaks. We wanted to create an application that would solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app would optimize the cost efficiency of travel for students, allowing them to find the best deals in flights with just one click.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and Flask to build our webapp and allow users to input information about their flight including university, destination, and date of departure. Our server then accesses this information and finds available flights that match the user's preferences. It then displays paths departing from the two airports nearest to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We experienced challenges integrating different platforms such as Python, Flask, the Google Cloud SDK, HTML, and CSS. We learned how to make each of these programs compatible with each other to create a functional and easy-to-use interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a functional webapp in the span of 36 hours at our first hackathon as freshmen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned both front end and back end skills in creating our webapp and learned how to collaborate through platforms such as Github to write code together.
                </p>

                    What's next for Fairwell
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement the Google Maps API to automatically detect the closest airports for college students and expand our service to all college students in the US.
