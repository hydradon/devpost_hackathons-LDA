                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by other specific search engines like Travelocity and Kayak, but on a smaller scale. We also felt it would be a challenging but not impossible task for our first Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tutors upload their information into the app; this allows them to found by users. People looking for a tutor type in the subject they need help with, the grade they are in, and their city and state. The app then goes through the tutors in the system, and displays the name and contact information of ones that share the same answer for at least one of these fields.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with the basics on Swift, like the user interface, and then moved on to the actual code from there. We used Xcode because it's an IOS platform that is user friendly (this is also why we chose Swift over Objective-C; the syntax is easier to understand and learn).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no knowledge of Swift coming into HackTJ, and we were trying our best by using the internet. However, it did not prove as useful as we would have liked, especially given the time frame, so we had a lot of assistance from mentors and our more experienced peers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to complete an app, although it doesn't work perfectly. Also, we learned a lot in a short amount of time. Finally, we didn't give up when things didn't go as planned, which was pretty often.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of Swift and Xcode, and how challenging coding can be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TutorYou
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make it run as we wanted it to; it is almost there but missing one key component. We also hope to make it more aesthetically pleasing and modern looking. Lastly, we wish to further develop the idea behind the app.
