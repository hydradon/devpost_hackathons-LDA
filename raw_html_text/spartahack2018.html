                    Initial idea:
                </p>
                <p>
                    An app that could be utilized by an android device mounted to the dashboard of a vehicle. Designed to bring peace of mind to parents with teen children, about to get behind the wheel alone for the first time, this app would first use the front facing camera to verify that the driver was wearing a seatbelt. Once mounted the screen would go dark, removing any distraction to the drive. The rear facing camera would search for street signs as the car started moving, comparing an estimate speed based on geo-location data to the posted street sign speed limits. Motion sensors in the phone were to be used to detect if the phone was removed from the dashboard mount and brought to a horizontal orientation. All of this data would be collected and a report would be sent to the parent of the new driver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Result:
                </p>
                <p>
                    An android app that can resonably detect the color of street sign and a IOS app that can resonably detect if a user is wearing a seatbelt. The project may have been too ambitious.
