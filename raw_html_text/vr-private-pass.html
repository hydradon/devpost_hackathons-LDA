                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a documentary about Edward Snowden, Snowden religiously placed a blanket over himself or the PC he was using when he typed in passwords to ensure cameras and those watching him could not track the movement of his hands and fingers. We thought we could take this a step further with by making a keyboard in VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The keyboard allows the user to enter a password by gazing at keys in a virtual reality keyboard. The keyboard that appears to the user randomizes it after every keypress to ensure the tracking of a user's head movements is meaningless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the application in Unity using the Oculus Rift SDK for the Oculus Rift headset. 3D modeling was done in SketchUp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have any previous experience developing in C# or Unity or developing for Oculus Rift. The entire project was a new experience that helped us learn about the systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a method to scramble the keyboard every time the password string has something added to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned physics properties in 3D modeling via vectors and raycasts.
The basis of the Unity platform.
The C# scripting system and its relationship to Unity.
Using the Oculus Rift Hardware.

                <h2>
                    What's next for VR Private Pass
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had the ability to continue developing for Oculus, we would create scripts that would allow VR Private Pass to be a password entry method for an actual login.
