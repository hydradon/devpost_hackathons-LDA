                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought harps were cool, but we realized the modern inconveniences of constantly recharging batteries and searching for power outlets had yet to affect the harp industry in a significant way. So we fixed that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plays notes as you move your hands into various locations in the air around the equipment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used several ultrasonic distance sensors, a laser, and a mirror to measure were the operators hands are above the instrument and what they are doing at any given time to equate that to music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time making the ultrasonic distance sensors measure hand locations like they were supposed to. This is a hardware issue that we have seen in previous projects as well. We also had difficulty making the instrument play the desired tones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took a beautiful instrument from antiquity and gave it the inconveniences of the modern world. In reality harps were never meant to be electrified so the fact that we did that anyways is something we are proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we really need to get some higher quality distance sensors for our next project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ultrasonic Laser Harp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are gonna try to put some better distance sensors in there so its more accurate.
