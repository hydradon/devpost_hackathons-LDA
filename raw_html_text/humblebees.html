                </h2>
                <p>
                    GhostGear is an app that tracks the location of the lobster cages, the buoys attached to them, the location of the fisherman, and the location of the other ships from other industries. This helps coordinate the different parties and let known the areas to avoid, so as to prevent the generation of more ghost gears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On top of it, it provides functionality such as calculating suspicious ships based on the location of the cages to deter intentional disposal of faulty lobster traps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a management tool, it can also track ghost gears to aid retrieval as well as keep track the ownership of lobster cages which encourages accountability.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GhostGear is a web app built mainly on Java and JavaScript. We also used Google Map API to display the location of the different items.
