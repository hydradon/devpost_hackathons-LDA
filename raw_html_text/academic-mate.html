                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing so many of our friends and family members fail their courses because of a lack of support. There is difficulty in finding a study partner for your class, and when you actually do, schedules get in the way and you are back to where you began with nobody to study with and struggling in class again. The whole tedious process of trying to find a friend and having to compare schedules with each person or going to other websites to fill in your calendar many times, just to find out in the end that you have no common study times. Another struggle is not knowing how that possible study partner you are about to meet will help you study like never before or be of no help at all.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Makes students' life easier by helping them find other like-minded individuals that want to get together and study to be able to pass and even Ace their classes. It provides a safe platform to communicate with other students and schedule meeting times. The greatest feature in this app is when students link their calendar to the cloud and the app itself will find meeting times for you to study with someone else for the same subject. It will scan thousands of other students taking the same course and wanting to study the same subject and it will offer you to send an invitation to a student with which you coincide in meeting time. The user can accept if they wish to try to study with that person or they can decline and the app will then search the database again for the next possible study partner. After the study session, the students can rate and review each other on how the study session went so other students may see who they would be working with if they pair up with them to study. We do not only connect students with peers in their classroom but also we connect them with students around the world.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the design of our app and website we use different software platforms like adobe UX, sketch (design), Wix website (demo), we also used google services to do research in facts about graduation rates and the number of college students in El Paso, TX. We started doing research on app and website development, then we found a theme for our website/app. Then, Microsoft and community mentors opened our eyes to a new perspective on how to implement new technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning. Also, how we can implement cybersecurity in our project to help the student community.

                    Scenario
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You enter into your ethics class, with over 300 students around you, and have no idea where to sit. In the blink of an eye, you fail your first-semester course, but you know you could have had an easy A with the help of a study partner.

                <p>
                    Lack of experience in building both mobile apps and websites.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting together and helping develop each other's ideas into something bigger. We are more than happy

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students need support in their not only educational life but also in their daily one because working together is always better than working alone because you get that sense of community and sense of belonging.
