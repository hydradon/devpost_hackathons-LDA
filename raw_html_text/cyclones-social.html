                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help ISU students meet new friends, and find people to do activities with (seeing a movie, taking a walk, studying)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website allows students to type in information about themselves, including their interests, their major, if they're interested in studying, and how they feel about school. The website then sends the information to a SQL database via AJAX, where the database sorts through the information to identify similar entries. When the entries are identified the database will send an email to the people involved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using HTML via Atom. We're planning on constructing the database using MySQL and connecting the two using AJAX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to finish the project because the MySQL required payment, and we did not have enough time to do all the coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out this weekend knowing almost nothing about coding. We have progressed very rapidly, learning about different types of coding and how to use are limited knowledge, as well as outside resources, to build a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of programming, how to use code to create websites, what types of challenges are involved in coding, how different coding languages interact, how to interprate code, etc. We knew almost nothing coming here, so we've made a great deal of progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cyclones Social
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're planning to learn more about coding and see if we can improve the site, as well as doing more research into methods of generating databases in the hopes of eventually taking our idea to fruition.
