                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was originally supposed to teach the user how to code in javascript and python but it is now a javascript helper tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a web app using ReactJS, Babel, and Webpack. The server runs off of the local machine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we tried to get the user's code, we were unable to run it in the browser so we had to get rid of the idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to somewhat recover from this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to plan out what we will do beforehand and in a more organized fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Code JavaScript
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will find some way to run the user's code.
