                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You  already know Infusionsoft is awesome. But all the greatness of Infusionsoft is left behind when you run in-person events, conferences and meetings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You use Infusionsoft to capture the Attendee Registration, and maybe send a confirmation email. But then you're done. EventDay brings all the goodness of your Infusionsoft mindset to in-person events to track everything your attendees do within your event, AND adds revenue opportunities for you to be more profitable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does EventDay Bring?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Live email, SMS reminders and communication to help the attendee get to your event. Imagine automatically sending a text message to all attendees with the venue address just 2 hours before registration opens so that everyone has the information on hand. Imagine personalized WELCOME text message to each attendee sent 30 seconds after they check in. WOW - That is a great welcoming feeling to open your event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once on site, we can now track everything your attendee does including sessions they visit, sponsors and booths. How they're feeling about your content based on built in evaluations. All along the way tagging the contact record in Infusionsoft so you can uniquely target and message each participant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What about Sales?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Events are all about selling. Sell more with EventDay using our Back-of-the-Room sales module. We bring in Electronic order forms using the Infusionsoft API.

                    <strong>
                        NO MORE PAPER ORDER FORMS
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
