                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In day 1 of the hackathon, we brainstormed many different ideas. We took part in an in-depth brainstorming process with a variety of brainstorming techniques to ensure the most thorough experience where everyone was heard. We developed rules for the process to defer judgment and prevent burnout, and we started with an unbiased slip-writing procedure. This was followed by Charette brainstorming with each individual on the team privately. After narrowing down our ideas, we critically analyzed the merits of each idea with a SWOT analysis for over ten different ideas all to ensure the best idea for Sunhacks would be produced.

                <p>
                    At it's core, it is a Google Maps app, but it is geared towards students. Users can input their classes, and they will be shown their possible route they can take throughout the day. Users can edit their route throughout the day dynamically as they might have spare time to find a local library and study, or visit a Starbucks for coffee and lunch.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team used Android Studio as their IDE and created a Flutter project under it. We use the programming language Dart, and used Google Cloud products such as the Google Maps API as the base of our program. We use our own interpreter and parser for the user's inputs, and we utilize longitude and latitude coordinates on our map.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team is an all-freshman team, so we all were learning at the same time as we developed our project. We were all new to Flutter and Dart and it was our first time developing a mobile app of any kind. It took us a long time to develop and get our first version of our program ready.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of all freshmen, I personally am proud of all of our members and the amount of work and dedication was put into this project. We learned a whole new language in under 3 days as well as learned how to develop an entire app that is native to both Android and iOS. The team came in knowing only Java from introductory computer science courses and almost nothing about hackathons, and all matured into young software developers.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole team learned the process of developing a native Android and iOS app through Flutter and the language Dart. We learned how to manage our time to get ready for the deadline that approaches us all.

                    What's next for mapLAD
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program mapLAD has a big potential to grow so much more. It is definitely scalable for other universities, as well as potentially the entire populace in the future. It was developed in only 3 days, so there is a lot of opportunities for us to further enhance the program as well as squish more bugs that might appear.
