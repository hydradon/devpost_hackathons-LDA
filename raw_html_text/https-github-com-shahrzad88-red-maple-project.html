                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the apps on the market depend a lot upon data entry by their audience. We wanted to create something that is not user-demanding but it provides them a better standard of consumer choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It analyses customer bank account report and checks the companies they are shopping at to give them a better idea of how much of their money is going into helping companies that are working towards being environmentally sustainable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started building it with html files with css and we used node.js for testing on localhost and then we used the free domain from Domain.com to build the website. We used app engine from google cloud to host it and we used the Places API from google cloud to provide customers with more info on the companies and we used cloud sql also from the google cloud console for the backend where we used data from the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Propagating nameservers from Domain.com took a long time and we barely got it done in time. Another problem was using library chart.js which is not responsive by default and it took us several hours to find the options that could scale properly. The biggest challenge was the time constraint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with a pretty great idea that would have a real-world impact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the google cloud console, web dev and filtering data in general.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Just working on the project in the future until it has a stable release with polished UI and UX and hopefully working on an Android App to accompany the website and keeping it open source so its accessible to people.
