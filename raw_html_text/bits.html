                    Disadvantaged persons have a hard time playing &lsquo;catch-up&rsquo;. Small set-backs really set them back.
Say you&rsquo;re a single parent living paycheck-to-paycheck and your car breaks down. Your car is your only means of transportation, meaning that you need it to get to work and to run family errands. You&rsquo;re barely making enough as it is to cover daily necessities though so, unless you have an emergency fund*, you&rsquo;re straight out-of-luck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those of us who are fortunate enough to have a dollar or several to spare, we may want to give back to our community, but we want to see our money have a direct, immediate and significant effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    *According to Bankrate's latest financial security index survey, 34 percent of American households experienced a major unexpected expense over the past year. However, only 39 percent of survey respondents said they would be able to cover a $1,000 setback using their savings.
