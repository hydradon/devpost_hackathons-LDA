                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our eyes are burning from staring at a screen for 12 hours so please check us out :)

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app, HairCycle is an innovative way to connect individuals to their nearby hair salons.
Surprisingly, human hair has been reused in several ways. It can be used for wigs, and also for cleaning up oil spills.
There are currently many separate organizations that deal with wigs for cancer patients, and oil spill cleans up using hair; this reduces the effectiveness and limits the amount of progress that can be done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Individuals can cut their hair at the salons or drop it off at their nearby salon. Short hair is sent to oil-spill cleanup centers, and longer hair is sent to cancer organizations to help create wigs for cancer patients.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Did research on the billion dollar hair industry
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Found a cost-effective way to reuse hair for wigs and oil-spill cleanups.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Followed instructions to implement Apple Maps into the project (used Maps Kit)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created log-in changing-screen &amp; linked firebase with the app
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finalized UI View control
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Challenges we ran into

                    <li>
                        Creating this app was our first time using the Maps Kit API provided by Apple. When trying to configure it, 5 total hours of debugging and re-creating was done to make the map work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The dynamic screen is also not something we were familiar with, had to essentially learn how to create from scratch. Took us 2 hours to get this part working.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest accomplishments in this app would be implementing the apple maps into our app and allowing the user's current location to influence what they see upon logging in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following a new API and adding features to Xcode projects such as page view and dynamic boomerang backgrounds.
                </p>

                    What's next for HairCycle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to publish this app into the app store after more modification has been done. We would like to add a live chat system between hair salons, volunteers, and individual donors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would also like to have a live notification system similar to that of venmo's publicized transactions.
