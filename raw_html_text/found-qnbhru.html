                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often we have countless tabs open while studying or programming can't seem to find that one tab we had open
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a word2vec machine learning model, we search through the text of your past sites to match keywords, being able to find information without remembering text word for word.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a python flask server to determine how close sites are to search queries. The front-end was handled in javascript and bootstrap html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to connect everything together and run a stable server on GCP
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, we were able to search for a video visually and return a timestamp
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a strong trade-off between the accuracy of searches and the time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Found
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Optimizations for the natural language processing and a more stable server.
