                    Inspired by the WIFI problems at MLH Prime spring'16 ,a solution to identify number of users and address the connectivity and coverage issues using bluetooth technology has been proposed as part of ZTE's CSX competition.

                    The solution proposes the use of several narrow band bluetooth devices to sense the presence of users and their locations is an area and account for the demand in a specific region using the information from the Bluetooth transceiver's experienced channel response. The current solution has advantage over traditional techniques by using white spaces present between the WIFI channels in 2.4 and 5 GHz bands to identify the presence of the users. Since in most cases the demand for Wireless connectivity over WIFI is directly proportional to number of users in the given environment, (not to forget even though  a user might be using smart phone at all time, but the device is constantly using WLAN to sync email and other notifications from various websites and service). Thus the presence of users gives a close estimate of the demand along with certain other parameters such as time of the day, average data consumption and demand by users.)

                    The solution can also be used by home users to actively track the user across the home. This allows to adapt the WLAN resources allocations to enhance performance, as well as to actuate devices such localized speakers to play music from a central system ( or stream from Services such as Pandora or Saavn or Spotify).
