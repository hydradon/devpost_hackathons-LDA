                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I noticed that a lot of people are very interested in starting to invest but they don't have the knowledge to start to invest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It predicts the price change between days and recommends the best stock to buy for the next day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the backend with TensorFlow. This was critical as it was the only way we could predict the stock and recommend the best stocks to buy and the best ones to sell. The app was built with flutter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was training the model in a timely manner. We didn't use our ideal amount of 100 stocks due to the amount of time it would take. Also, training a neural network on the cloud is usually a good thing until the connection times out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very happy to be able to get pretty decent predictions for the stock price increase on a 1-day spread.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about TensorFlow and how to properly make a machine learning algorithm. T
