                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wants to make the world a better place. And an environment around us has to be fresh and comfortable to live. The understanding of the harm that humanity makes each year is very important for every creature and Earth itself. 
Our app helps with tracking the manufacturers' impact on the environment.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application gathers data about plants' locations and ecological situation close to them. It tracks suppliers involved in the production of a particular product and calculates the environmental index for it. The item is detected using the neural network detection algorithm from a photo a user makes.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have chosen several large manufacturers like Apple Inc. and built suppliers' chain for each of them. We extracted coordinates of each supplier and placed them on the map. ESA provides API with quite a few environmental descriptors, which we used to build the aggregated 'greenness score' and to draw the heat map. We then match these two maps so the impact of each supplier is easy to see on the map.

                <p>
                    We learned how to use the data provided by ESA and Outotec and create a mobile application using these data.
