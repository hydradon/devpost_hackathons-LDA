                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create individual reflection on environment and water consumption by making a design that shows your consumption in a visible and tangible way in your daily life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our design is a plant, but not just any plant. The design contains a beautiful pot, a storage unit for water, a pump to water the plant, a moisture-sensor and the identity, that is, the plant itself through an OLED-screen.
We analyze data from water pumps in your home. If you consumes a sustainable amount of water your plant will be watered by the pump and storage unit. If the plant is watered the OLED(Shawn) shows a happy face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you over-consume water there will not be enough water for Shawn. Shawn will be dry and he will have a sad face. If this goes on for too long the plant will die which will be showed on the display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a micro-controllers to control the water pump through a relay and to control the OLED screen. We have used Arduino to build the prototype of these functionalities.
Besides the Arduino we have made a frontend application with ReasonML and React to log the data directly from the pump and translate into Shawn's watering state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some challenges when it came to choosing the right language to code the frontend application in. We also had challenge parsing the JSON due to ReasonML being a strictly statically typed language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it came to the Arduino none of us had ever worked with the OLED screen or a waterpump or a relay system before. So we had to adapt to new opportunities and challenges and combine it all to one functional script.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The design-process was however the biggest challenge and where we spent a lot of time. We wanted to finde an idea and make something truely great and not just a display of your water-use. This took plenty of brainstorming sessions and almost half the hackathon. But it gaves a lot of insights and reflections that ended up in our final awesome design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made plant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That design processes is important because the right idea creates the motivation to create under the kind of pressure that you do in AUHack
                </p>

                    What's next for Shawn the Plant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polish and shipping. Get out and save humanity.
