                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application provides the ability for a user to play a virtual piano (with Virtual Reality), while using fully mapped hands (via Leap Motion). This allows for more accurate, real-to-life playing of a piano.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can choose to play on the virtual piano freely, highlighting his/her keystrokes, or practice by following a series of keystrokes read in by a sample song file.
                </p>
