                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team and I were inspired by Amadeus's 'Go Further' Challenge that asks for a project that will Connect people, bring them together, and make travel accessible to more people than ever before.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MeetupMarker is an application where a user can create a pickup event to play a particular sport. The user will select his/her location and choose the amount of players that he/she would like. Other users of the application can see nearby events that are going on and get directions to go and join the event. They will also be notified of how many people there currently are in the event.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by getting familiar with how to use Android studio. We made fragments and a User Interface based on simplicity and user-friendliness. Afterwards, we created the RESTful API which makes the server that stores the users' information inside a database, and enables users to see other users' markers with the map we integrated thanks to the help of Google Maps API.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Maps API for Android was quite tricky. Getting familiar with all the possible features took quite a long time, and debugging some problems took many hours in our hacking time. Another problem that we ran into was the lack of time for the vision that we had for this project. But this only gives us incentive for us to keep working on this application.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to integrate the map and have markers based on the user's location with the Google Maps API. I am extremely proud for my team and I for being able to pull that off. Another great accomplishment was the ability to make the RESTful API, since it is the lifeblood of our application. It is what makes the interactions between people

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team and I learned about how to implement a server side backend with the use of the RESTful API. Additionally, we learned how to utilize google's many different developer resources such as Android Studio, Google Maps API, and even Google Cloud Platform.

                    What's next for MeetupMarker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a lot more for MeetupMarker, and it cannot get better without the help of you individuals! We are making our repository open source, so anybody is allowed to contribute to the app. We are currently looking to add more features such as setting start and end times for events, filter events based off of user preference, add more event choices, and many more. We even invite the development community to propose ideas for new features for us to implement!
