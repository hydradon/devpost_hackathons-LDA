                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program was inspired by the DnDLite program we made in CS180, I liked coding it, and wanted to make a project of my own along the same lines that went a bit more in depth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You enter your name, get your characters stats, and fight various monsters until you die, with oportunities to gain more powerful weapons along the way!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I planned out the stats of the monsters, weapons, and spells first, and then implemented them. I then programmed the game loop, and all the various actions a player can take. Finally, I had people play test it to work out game balance and to find bugs and glitches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes my loop structures would be off, and it would take a while to find the issue. Additionally, I had a problem with the termination segment of my for loops that generated random numbers.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of how smoothly the program runs now, as well as how many people say they had fun playing my game!

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A project will always be more complicated than you first thought

                    What's next for Radiant Razor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to further develop the game in my free time and implement new features.
