                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that not many people know the local lawmakers that influence their everyday lives. With this app we realized we could change that. By displaying information of these Representatives, we hope that users will gain a better understanding of the political world around them.

                <p>
                    RepConnect gets your current location and gives you information on local political figures.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using Google Maps API, Civic Information API, Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were: Translating addresses to longitude and latitude and vice versa, integrating the Civic Information API with the Google Maps API, and parsing the information from our GET requests to be integrated into our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We succeeded in integrating the Civic Information and Google Maps API. Another accomplishment is the success in the direct linking of phone numbers, emails, websites and addresses.
