                    RoboLPS (local positioning system) is a system to track the movement of a robot using an infrared camera. It involves placing a camera looking down on a scene while also equipping the robot to be tracked with an infrared LED. Using inverse projection, we are able to accurately track the motion of the robot.
The main applications for this project are consumer and industrial robotics. It is useful in the industrial sense because it could enable a fleet of robots to move around a factory floor entirely autonomously, as they would be aware of their position using this system. This would allow for types of automation that aren't possible with traditional factory environments.
RoboLPS is also very useful in the field of consumer robotics, specifically internet-of-things enabled devices. In order for robots to navigate around a user's home, they need some sort of indoor positioning system. Furthermore, by attaching other sensors to the robots, they can create maps of the environment as they navigate, allowing more efficient path finding by robots afterwards.
