                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 'device' rotates an object as we take pictures of it. We then run the picture through a 3D modelling software.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an ESP8266 based NodeMcu as the brain of the whole thing, a DRV8825 stepper motor driver and an old printer stepper motor. The stepper motor spins a platter which holds the object as it turns.  We used different Arduino/C++ libraries for wifi functionality and controlling the stepper motor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Powering the motor/drive.
                </p>

                    What's next for 3D Scanner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are currently looking into automating the entire process.
