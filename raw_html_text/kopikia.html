                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The movement towards cashless payments is

                    </a>
                    . Small food establishments do not see the value in implementing cashless payment services, citing the huge hassle not worth the savings. Moreover, they do not really have an incentive to adopt or create their own web solutions for online ordering as well as keeping track of daily sales and logs for analytics purposes.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    'KopiKia', or 'coffee boy' aims to tackle these problems by being the utility man these small F&amp;B businesses needed all along. By providing a POS service that can be run on a mobile device such as a tablet, KopiKia allows for a simple way to keep track of sales for small scale analytics to be done to improve their own businesses, where larger solutions more suitable for larger chains of restaurants might not be feasible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, it allows for consumers to be able to order online and for these small F&amp;B businesses to have a meaningful digital presence and to accept alternative forms of payment.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Meteor.js with semantic-ui.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quite a few of us are building a Javascript application for the first time! Learnt lessons about best UI practices and possible improvements.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not really have enough time to flesh out all the possible features, but here are some possibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Payment solution through Stripe Connect/Paypal
Location/Message based marketing for small businesses
Intuitive search with bots / location for analytics - Users might not know the right questions to ask, so we can possibly look for simple insights by looking at the data which is feasible given the narrow scope of F&amp;B only.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will probably be building a more refined version of this project for a school project. This will serve as a useful prototype to learn about the limitations as well as possible improvements.
