                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard and troublesome to access medical files in the Bahamas. You have to go and set an appointment, speak with multiple people and it generally takes a lot of time and effort to access something so closely related to you. So we wanted to fix that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The blockchain that we were working on allows users to view their files whenever they want. Doctors are able to input information, and insurance companies will have access to files for reference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of making a blockchain using JavaScript, we opted for the easy to understand Java language. We created a java project which contains a Java Applet, simply a mini program ran through Java. This program (if we had time) could have been embedded into our  website allowing for users to create their very own blockchain of medical records.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lack of time made it so that we could not embed the Applet (which is replaced by a html place holder we made) , we were never taught how to make a blockchain in Java nor did we ever learn how to create Applets, power outages,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of; How the websites look
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that websites are honestly pretty easy to make; blockchains, on the other hand are not. Embedding the Java blockchain into the html document was a challenge, but we are very proud.
                </p>
