                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You've seen the Theremin? We are the next that.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By tilting and turning a microbit, a harmonised melody is created on 3 other microbits.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With 1 microbit acting as the network master and 3 other as its slaves, we broadcast the direction and tilt to the slave microbits. The slaves calculate the octave and specific note of the scale from this data and produces an appropriate pitch on a Grove Buzzer. We have modified the code on each of the microbits so that it harmonises the notes produced.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Limited electronics/ coding experience with some team members. Lack of components to test project efficiently. Making the product easy to use but broad in terms of sounds it could create.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Splitting work up evenly between the group - we all had specific tasks that worked in tandem. Encorporating and developing all our ideas into the final product. It actually worked!!
