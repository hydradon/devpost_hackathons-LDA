                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are called pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro, which means tomato. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app let's you select how long each work period should be, how long each break period should be and how many periods altogether there should be.  The watchface itself shows how much time is remaining during the period and gives vibrations to warm 1 minute before periods elapse and when they are over.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is made with the Pebble SDK and is coded in entirely pebble C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using the default fonts included limited the size of displayable fonts, so we had to include a custom font file (.ttf).
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First app finished during a hackathon, and something that is very applicable and I would use myself if I had a pebble.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of how the Pebble OS works and it's libraries in general.

                <p>
                    Next is to leverage the existing logic and provide fancier visualisations for time remaining, customizable alert times and random motivational messages.
