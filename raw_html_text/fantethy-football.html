                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While brainstorming ideas for what to build, Devon updated her fantasy football team and realized that players could easily be tokenized to keep track of their points and which team they belong to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows for a sequential draft of players across all users in the league, then allows users to view their players and their league. The POC also has "simulate game" feature to generate some dummy points to determine a winner for the league, as typical fantasy football leagues span several months.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by building out a basic UI in React and a simple smart contract, then connecting the two through a custom API. As we added features, we created additional functions within our smart contract, moved our app from running locally to running on Skale, and continued building out the UI in React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty with the initial transaction time of Ropsten, which is why Skale fit in so well with our solution.
The Wifi kept going out :c
We also had some initial issues merging Torus with Skale. It was definitely an interesting challenge, and we managed to get the two connected!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of building a working demo for our app that is able to integrate with an actual blockchain and still load quickly (Thanks Skale!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about building UIs in React. We also learned about how to integrate with a blockchain like Skale and how to authenticate and process transactions with Torus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fantethy Football
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shamir shared an interesting idea with us for integrating a trading card game with fantasy football. In this situation, each player's trading card would be an ERC-721 token, and players would be able to bet their virtual cards on the outcome of real life football games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Extra Note
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to be considered Torus bounty as well please. Devpost won't let us update our previous selections.
