                <p>
                    Our solution consists of two parts:
                    <a href="https://github.com/flightwallet/frontend" rel="nofollow">
                        terminal
                    </a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://github.com/flightwallet/ios" rel="nofollow">
                        mobile app
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Terminal part
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It lets you create a transaction so you could sign it with our app. You can specify the currency to accept, the destination address and the amount to receive.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Mobile app part
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It works like a simple cold wallet but lets you sign transactions without an internet access. That will require some additional information, that should be received from a terminal.

                        Generates addresses for popular blockchains (like Bitcoin and Ethereum). A user can insert his own private keys.

                    <li>
                        In order to send signed transaction, the mobile app should know some details about the outside world. To retrieve them, a terminal needs to know the address of a mobile app user, that is shared via QR code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The terminal sends via QR code information about the invoice. The app user verifies it and the app itself sign the transaction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The data of signed transaction will be sent to the terminal via QR code too.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've made a static frontend-only web page for creating transactions and sending signed transactions into blockchain network (terminal). We've also made an iOS and Android (just started) apps for signing transactions and keeping private keys encrypted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's open source and fully transparent so our users know that we are at their side.

                    <li>
                        There is a lack of good libs to work with Bitcoin for iOS and Android so we had to manually fix them a bit. We have tried almost all of them and nothing works.

                    <li>
                        Developing at a fast pace because the first 24 hours of hackathon were spent at solving CTF track (that actually ends very suddenly).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lack of expertise in mobile development.
