                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes you forget to send that 'good morning' text to your significant other, and the results can be catastrophic.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With our application, you can select a contact, select a time window to send a message between, and then hit go. From there, a randomized Good Morning text will be created and sent at the randomized time every day until stopped.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UI. As always.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the sentence randomization completed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that things in Android Studio are a lot easier than you might think they are at first.
                </p>

                    What's next for Automantic

                <p>
                    In the next coming days we will complete our application fully. Once it is finished, we have plans to put it on the Google Play store for free.
