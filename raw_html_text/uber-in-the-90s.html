                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the day of the Great Uni Hack I got here thanks to Uber because I woke up late. Once the hackathon started, I wondered how would Uber look like if it was made in the 90s. Therefore, I looked at the Uber website today and started investigating design and colours used by websites thirty years ago and started experimenting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows a webpage that has links to all the services of Uber, including Uber Eats, Uber Business and Uber Jump Bikes. The available service for now is Uber Cars, as the others are being developed (we are in the 90s right?).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it from scratch using Html, CSS, Javascript and the framework JQuery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Imagine to create a website back in 90s trying to be little influenced by how websites look today.
                    <br>
                    -Animated gifs created by hand with Illustrator
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Gif of the car that goes on and on, on the Home page
-Overall dynamic view of the website
-Simple and intuitive design
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -I learned how to deal while combining elements in the body of an Html document
-DOM manipulation 
-Discovered power of JQuery 
-How to build gifs from scratch
-Time management, the deadline is 24 hours
-Stretching imagination
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Uber in the 90s
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keep it as a side project in order to gain deeper knowledge about the programming languages used. Also, it's possible to make the code more readable and maintainable. The next big thing will be moving it onto mobile devices in order to display it there in a nice way.
