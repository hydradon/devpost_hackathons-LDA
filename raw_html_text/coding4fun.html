                    What is this?
This is the green-bin. A rewards program, and mini-tomagotchi game, where you can clean up the environment of the poor penguin.
Ideally, there would be a micro-bottle Depo, which would immediately give you your bottle deposits back, however due to lack of hardware and time this was excluded from our goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The locations of the local bottle depos is available in the app itself inside one of the apps menus and promotes a system of leaderboards where users can compare with other users how their recycling points stack against others.
