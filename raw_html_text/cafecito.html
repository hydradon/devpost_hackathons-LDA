                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1 Billion people speak English. Out of the world's 3.5 Billion people that are connected on the internet today. Only 18.9 Million of them are developers. In order for computer science to grow, the programming languages we use have to accommodate the people that are going to use them.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presenting Cafecito, a transpiler that takes in non-English Java vocabulary and compiles it down to English standard Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a lexicographer within the language tools to take in Spanish, French, Polish, Mandarin, Russian, Hindi, Portuguese, Italian, Korean and many more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is intuitive to add languages, and a large set of the Java standard library is supported out of the box. Now our tutorials can now match the code we are writing. People who speak those languages can now have greater control of their terminology and define the concepts in their languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a ANTLR grammar rule that checks a mapping of the translation and then replaces the reserved words. We have a Java program that loops into the class file and then brings it to the standard library.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are doing compiler work, enough said.
