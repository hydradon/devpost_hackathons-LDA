                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa herself is been always the first inspiration. Me and my family loves Alexa a lot and she takes part in most of our day to day activities like reminders, routines, timers, alarms, controlling lights and so on!! First of all, this is my first skill I have ever built and I have no coding experience. Initially I loved building custom skills using Alexa Blueprints, and amazed to see "Alexa responding as per I defined it's supposed to be". This is the first trigger to see and challenge myself if I could make a try building a real skill and finally created a Amazon developer Account last week and started learning so many "How to" and started building!! The second trigger is my kids love talking to Alexa a lot, when leaving home we say "Alexa, Bye" and she says "Bye for now". So the idea behind this is simple, as Alexa playing a role being part of family all day long, when someone says Bye to Alexa when stepping out, it would be great if she says a happy bye with a positive note.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa says "Bye" to the one who says Bye to her in "Alexa Way". What i meant as Alexa way, is the the positive quotes along with a Bye has been customized and created as if it aligns with Alexa's personality or way of speaking! 
There is someone to say bye happily with a positive note, it's Alexa's Bye Buddy!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In headless devices, After enabling Bye Buddy skill to Alexa, whenever you say "Bye buddy" she will say "Bye Bye Buddy!! followed by a positive note"
In screened devices, After enabling Bye Buddy skill to Alexa, whenever you say "Bye buddy" she will say "Bye Bye Buddy!! followed by a positive note along with a Background image with the note displayed on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning and watching more how to documents and videos and learning key instructions provided. After trail and errors, learning where and how to work, learning coding and with support and help from my husband and kids, finally "Alexa started saying "Bye Bye Buddy" along with some surprise quote from Today morning!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every step is a challenge as well as learning, after failures and error messages during some changes in code, finally understood the way its working and made it happen!! Motivation and support is always needed for everyone to start something new and i got it from my family.
