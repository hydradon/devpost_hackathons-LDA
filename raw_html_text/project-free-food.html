                    Nova Robotics is a non-profit community service organization with a mission to directly impact humanity's biggest challenges such as climate change and food/water security. The word 'robot' in our name is representative of the modern tools and technology available to us in solving problems.

                    Technology advancement in Vertical Gardening is currently our main focus. Vertical Gardens are fantastic at dramatically reducing the water, space and energy required to grow food in cities (where most people live). We have successfully designed an air-powered water circulation system for vertical farming that is significantly cheaper, simpler and energy efficient compared to conventional methods.
