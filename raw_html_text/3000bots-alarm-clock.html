                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have parents and grandparents who tend to forget to take their medicine, so decided to create an alarm clock that reminds them to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 3000Bots Alarm Clock allows the user (i.e. parents or grandparents) to set the alarm for the given time to take their medicine by clicking on the "Set" button. The "Set" button populates the hour, minute and AM/PM the user have inputted. The alarm clock automatically display the current time until the current time equals the alarm time in which the "Alarm Trigger" will display "Take Your Medicine". The user have the ability to clear out the fields to set another reminder time.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the 3000Bots Alarm Clock using Java programming language within the NetBeans Software Program. We utilize various resources to get the alarm clock to input and run the current time, set the alarm to the user specified alarm time, clear the inputs fields and trigger the alarm "Take Your Medicine" when the alarm time and current time equal to each other. We utilized a graphical user interface to create a visually appealing alarm clock that allows the user to see the inputs and trigger.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into two challenges in creating the 3000Bots Alarm Clock. The first challenge we ran into was getting the alarm to output the current time with a leading number if it is less than 10. For example, if the time was 1:05AM, the alarm would initially output 1:5AM. We decided to utilize a variable within the program to help the alarm to recognize to input this when the current time is configured. The second challenge was the alarm trigger to display "Take Your Medicine" in which we had trouble comparing the current time and alarm time to get the output to print to the screen. We noticed we needed to create a method called "Alarm Check" to verify whether the alarm time equal the current time in the system. Also, we had to add imports for the system to recognize the key variable, Time.

                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to create a working project within the hackathon 24 hours timeline! Also, we are happy that we could create something from our imaginations to help others in the community.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the Java programming language, how to use NetBeans, researching how to integrate code into our program to save time and how to collaborate on a technical project within a tight deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 3000Bots Alarm Clock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to keep in contact to enhance the program further by allowing the alarm to make a sound using music, the person voice as a personal touch or incorporating the concept into a game that allows the user to set the time to display "Stop" to avoid playing the game too long.
