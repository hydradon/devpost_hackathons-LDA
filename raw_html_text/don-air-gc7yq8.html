                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The recent event of Australian bush fires affected us a lot. A lot of human lives, animals and resources were affected because of that. 
Mitigation of sudden natural disaster is difficult. Those affected are not always ready for it, and after the disasters hit, they lack basic supplies that they may need. 
People are usually willing to donate, but donating supplies entails a lot of extra expenditure like transportation. We came up with this solution so that donors can easily contribute to the victims of disasters from any part of the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application can be used by Non-profit organizations to make sure that the collected supplies can be donated efficiently. The Application helps leverage the empty space left in the Airplane after check-in to transport the donated supplies to the affected area. The Organizations at the affected areas will pick up the supplies to make them reachable at the right place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used simulated data for this and Node.js to design the application. The American Airline API will give us some of the required data which will be used to track the flight schedules.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating data with front-end using Django was really difficult as we did not have all the available data at the same time. We wanted to make prediction model for empty space on the Airplane but the data was unavailable. We had to simulate a lot of data to make the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that two of the members being the first time hackers, we could contribute this much to the project and got to learn a lot. We are proud to say that we attempted to mitigate one of the major problem and came up with this solution.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <h2>
                    What's next for Don-air
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can make the application ready to integrate with the Airline Systems. We can predict the empty space in the Airplane if more real time data is available. The application can be polished and work flow can be made more intuitive.
