                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Henry and I met for the first time today through a mutual friend that connected us. We're not used to working togehter so we thought we would do a classic web experience for our hackathon challenge. As we were thinking about ideas, we found this hackathon space really nice and fancy, but little drafty(cold). We thought we could offer up some good suggestions on what to wear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use an open weather api to find the current real feel temp and then fetch clothing suggestions through the eBay api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node.js with twitter bootstrap as the front end. We fetched data for each of the two api's and added it to our splash page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have time to integrate other api's. I wanted to monetize with some referral links. Henry is still working hard on how we can get better results from the ebay api as it is because there was so many repeat results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud because we finished this with a lot of time to spare. We have never worked together so we both were not expecting to have finished this with about 4-5 hours of work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting good results from API's can be tricky. Henry and I (Clarence) work well together. What to Wear is just the beginning of great things we will create together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for What to Wear
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing. We were satisfied with the results of this project and with the time left on the hackathon we moved on to making an Alexa skill.
