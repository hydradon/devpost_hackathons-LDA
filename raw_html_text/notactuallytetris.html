                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I play a lot of Tetris, and I'm interested in machine learning. So I figured this would be a good project.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the technique known as NEAT, the program uses a genetic algorithm to evolve neural networks that play Tetris.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The implementation of NEAT was made by us in Java. We then made Tetris from scratch, and fine-tuned the method until it was satisfactory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine learning isn't a magic box that you can just throw problems at and expect to have them solved. Much of the challenge involved creative thinking about how to approach a minimal, sufficient representation of the Tetris board, and an appropriate fitness function that would accurately rank the neural networks.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use a naive search algorithm to determine the values of two critical hyperparameters. Because of this, we were able to quickly find good solutions that were significantly better than initial solutions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement games in JavaFX, as well as further techniques in machine learning optimization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TetrisAI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we decide to go further with the project, we would likely use a multivariate statistical approach to fine-tuning all the hyperparameters. Furthermore, adding more techniques such as speciation would additionally improve our results.
