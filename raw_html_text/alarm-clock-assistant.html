                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the new AI digital assistant of today; these include Google Assistant, Siri, Alexa and many more. These programs are very helpful and we made a simple assistant for android devices. Many times, the first few things we do when we wake up are snooze your alarm and check the time. With this app, it makes this easier by reading out the time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you select a time, it reads it out loud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the text-to-speech program and alarm clock separately in android studio and then combined them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges combining the programs because we had different classes and it was difficult to put things together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we managed to put it together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use android studio to make an android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alarm Clock Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we will add weather functionality, in which the assistant will read the weather forecast along with the time.
