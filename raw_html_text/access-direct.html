                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all got tired of wandering around in university buildings hunting for where we needed to be.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Access Direct is a digital signage system that adds accessability, and eliminates the need to hunt for where you're supposed to be meeting your professors or classmates.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Bottle as a web server, we added layers of

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The borrowable Dragonboards were all checked out so we called upon our friends in the Akron rocket club to borrow theirs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it running in a short amount of time and providing accessibility for people: both really make us happy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned better use of cloud technologies and how they can serve to make a powerful application
                </p>

                    What's next for Access Direct
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we would like to add even more accessibility features as well as more information about each teacher.
