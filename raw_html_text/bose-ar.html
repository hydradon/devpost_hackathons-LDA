                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In everyday life, we realized that an increased number of young people suffer from the so-called "text neck", where an increase of upper-back pain and neck soreness affect both their physical and mental states. Moreover, we also wanted to create an interactive platform for our elders to stay active and at the same time, train muscle movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our series of games involve simple yet dynamic movements of the neck and head, with the special Bose AR experience. This game particularly involves a wide range of movements and coordination - left, right, up, and down with the goal of rolling our pet ball to consume boxes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The technology of Bose AR integrating with Unity is how the games are executed. Maximizing the motion direct sensor of the Bose AR, we located and created moving and rotation motion for the GameObject -- the ball using C#. Also, locating the spacial relations between the ball and their food (boxes), the boxes was achieved by utilizing the Unity Collider api to deactivate the boxes when collision occurs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity and C# are new technologies we decided to make our project in so everything was new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to overcome technical difficulties and debug by trying numerous methods, scratching and rewriting our code over and over. Through seeking advice from technical experts and digging deep into built-in code files, we were able to get the key variable from sensor to make the ball move forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For all of us, we definitely gained new insight about the AR/VR technology, starting from scratch including the programming language, the software, the headset, and API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for bose-AR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to create a series of games (more than 2) that involves deeper thoughts into what tasks would be accomplished in each games, inviting neurologists, physicists, and other professionals in the sciences to provide insights towards the motions that could relief of pain and stress.
