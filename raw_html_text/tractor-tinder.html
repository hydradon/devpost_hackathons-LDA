                    Challenge Three
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were approached with a problem of creating a marketplace which would allow farmers to purchase parts more easily. We thought to ourselves it would be better to create not only a marketplace but also a space where farm enthusiasts could connect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tractor Tinder+ allows user to connect with other individuals who are interested in buying and selling farming machinery and equipment. It allows user to lookup the products they are interested in purchasing and provides them with the nearest possible matches both by location and description. Swipe right to match with the seller and swipe left if not interested. If both the buyer and the seller agree on a common price range, they will be connected through a chat service and will be allowed to further negotiate price, shipping details, and any other relevant information.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This will be a mobile application which was built using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge that we ran into is that we do not know how to use Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out how to use Android Studio and decided to make a presentation instead of not showing up today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the Android Studio development platform and also about combining front-end and back-end development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we believe our concept for Tractor Tinder+ is very good our app has some bug fixes which need improvement. We had difficulty gaining access to the provided SQL database using Android Studio. We would like to first fix the bugs in our app and then we would like to add functionalities which allow us to match buyers with sellers in their region based on location data. Along with this we would need to do independent research to determine if we could possibly facilitate the shipping and payment between buyers and sellers.
