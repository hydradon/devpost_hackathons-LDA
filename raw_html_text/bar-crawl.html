                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knowing that bar crawls can be hectic and you can often lose your friends along the way, we wanted to create an app that lets you keep track of your friends and check on them if they end up by themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows users to login in via facebook, create bar crawls, and invite friends. After this they can view the bar crawl schedule and a map that shows where all their friends are, using a google maps api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using android studio as our primary IDE. We implemented Facebook API, to allow users to login with Facebook. In addition to the Facebook API, we also used the Google Places API that allows the user to search for bars and add them to their bar crawl schedule. The last API we implemented was Google Maps that displays users and bars on a map that are apart of the current user's bar crawl. Lastly, for our back end we used a Firebase database for real-time updates.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many issues, including implementing all APIs, as well as interfacing with our Firebase database. All of our team members are relatively new to android, which also proved to be a challenge.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud we were able to successfully implement all our APIs and complete some of the functionality we were hoping to implement.
