                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There has been in increase in the number of vehicle collisions in NYC, for a variety of reasons as you see on TV there are many commercials that address this isssue the most familiar being to not text and drive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically what it does is filter the data from nyc open data about vehicle collision reports and displays a histogram showing the total number of injuries by borough, borough with the most reported incidents, most common cause, etc. When you filter by either date, address, borough, or zip code it will display the ten reports for each page and plot the points in which the collision occured on the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it using purely javascript, once we got the data we were able to manipulate it to supply the histogram with different tally values, and plot the areas where the incidents had occured on a map using the google maps api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly it was using new libraries such as the google maps api and the chart.js library. It took a while to understand the documentation and get the application to run smoothly. The biggest challenge was the solve problems while fighting back my lack of sleep.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I was able to submit this on time and that it actually worked without me flipping a table
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pair Programming is very helpful. Pair Programing is the future.

                    What's next for NYC Vehicle Collision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many possibilities that can exist for our project, for example it can be used to find a pattern on where most of the vechicle incidents occur, thereby helping to get to the root cause of a problem. For example finding a street with a high number of collisions you can visit it and notice that the road needs to be paved, or the change in traffic light are quicker than normal. By using our application we can identify a potential problem and leave it up to the user to investigate or speak up on behalf of a community that would desperately need some change in their road in order to keep people safe and lower the hundreds of NYPD or ambulence calls that occur everyday.
