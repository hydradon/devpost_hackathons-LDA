                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Retail stores are probably not going to go away any time soon; people need jobs and some customers enjoy the trip down to the supermarket. However, there are areas where this process can be streamlined to be more efficient and pleasurable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waitr allows you to enter any restaurant and send your order directly to the kitchen right away. No need to wait for a service person to take your order or bring your bill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waitr is built using the NCR development platform to store restaurant, order, and customer information. Using ruby we are able to request the server for the information and load the menu of any restaurant on our network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges was to make this app seem useful past just restaurants. Some people enjoy the personal touch of a waiter and may be deterred from our service. Designing the backend in a way that allows it to be applied to any general stores was a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the way the service has been designed. It is very scalable, even past the food industry. The same ideas can be applied to retail or any storefront.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the NCR development platform. This was the first time we used it and it was certainly useful for this project. The well-organized platform structure allowed us to segment tasks for analyzing catalogue items and their details.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Waitr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waitr has a lot of potential for expansion. The generic design of the store objects and their inventory means the same system could be used to process an order at a BestBuy.
