                    Broadband Internet is failing to reach billions of people living in the developing world, including 90 per cent of those living in the poorest nations, according to a 2015 United Nations report that offers country-by-country data on the state of access around the globe.

                    In other developing countries, governments have started to recognize the value of the mobile internet, and have acted to make smartphones more affordable. However, while smartphones are undoubtedly cheaper, the total cost of ownership is keeping many people offline. Right now, the biggest barrier is data cost. There are few unlimited data plans &ndash; most smartphone users pay for online access in increments, with pre-paid vouchers. The problem is that these data plans are prohibitively expensive.

                    In our current year, the internet is a key component for driving innovation and progression. While this remains a great benefit for stronger nations, poorer developing countries are falling further behind in terms of industrialization and globalization.

                    Through our application HorizonSMS, people in developing countries will have access to internet searching without the use of cellular data. Instead, we leverage the power of Short Message Service (SMS) to send quick and inexpensive internet-based information to any kind of mobile phone.
