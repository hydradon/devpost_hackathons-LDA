                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ben Eggleston's grade calculator. Even though Mr. Eggleston created a very nice grade calculator you need to input all the data manually while our program does all the hard work for the user and just displays the users GPA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It asks for the student's username and password then logs into the Genesis grade portal then goes to the tab where the final grades are located and scrapes them. We then store the grades in a list and then process it to find the students GPA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Selenium for web scrapping, numpy to process the data, and Tkinter for a simple GUI
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Different formats of Genesis caused different issues that had to be solved while still keeping the original program working. We also had some trouble connecting our GUI with our logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a working application with everything we wanted. We finished all these tasks with time to sleep and for fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to web scraping using Selenium as well as creating a GUI with Tkinter. We also learned how to use GitHub.
