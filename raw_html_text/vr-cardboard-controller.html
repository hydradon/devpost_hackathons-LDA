                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Chrome Lightsaber Escape Experiment and other high-end VR products
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a controller for the Google Cardboard VR using a secondary device which does not currently exist. Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and other high end virtual reality products have their own positional tracking and 3D control system, however, Cardboard does not. Our product aims delivers CR immersion using the gyroscope from any old or new smartphone to track movement in a Cardboard game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the server using socket.io and js and our demo was made using three.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many Many Challenges! connecting the two phones were a big one, as well as actually designing a game since we have no game development in the past. Also, we initially wanted to make this native but all of our code was lost to a virus :'(
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a final product. We are high school students interested in virtual reality but have no had much exposure so we are happy we created a product that can be used by anyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned three.js and how to create a server
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VR Cardboard Controller
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Positional tracking, lower latency, a fully function game and some real world solutions!
