                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a joke this morning, I sleepily exclaimed , "We should make 'Tinder for Dogs!'" (Our team was fresh out of ideas.) Miles and Peter laughed at first, and thought it was a stupid idea. However, after putting our heads together and actually thinking of my crazy idea, our project "Super Shopper" was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Super Shopper" is a fast and easy way to browse online for any clothing product you want, without actually knowing what you want. The app displays pictures of clothing and apparel, and has three functions. You can either swipe left, look for items that are vastly different than the one that is pictured, swipe right, look for similar products to the one that has been shown, or you could double tap the picture and go straight to the website where you can look at the price of the item/sizes/colors etc.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collectively as a team, we found pictures and links online to different items of clothing/accessories, which we plugged into the program "marvelapp" to create our finished product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Halfway into the Hackathon, the program that we were using, "marvelapp," decided to go under maintenance. This means that we could not access our app for 3 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that even though we had a three hour setback, we still managed to finish our unique product on time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I already knew how to use "marvelapp", however Peter and Miles did not. They both managed to master the program within the amount of time that they were given, and apply their cognitive prowess to help create an excellent app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Super Shopper!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once this Halkathon is said and done, Super Shopper will be expanded and eventually published as a downloadable app. Its creators will continue to work on this program until it is polished to perfection!!
