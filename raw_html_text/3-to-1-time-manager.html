                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that the best way to study is if you have a plan, dividing up your time evenly and properly (in a 3 to 1 ratio) is the best way to maximize productivity. Studies have shown that it is best to do 3 times as much work for every time you break to get the most work done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app asks the user for the amount of time they plan on studying, using an algorithm it determines how much time should be spent work and how much time should be spent on breaks. The user is reminded in consistent intervals when it is time to work or break, all while maintaining a 3 to 1 ratio of work to break time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web app using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and MDL-Lite. We collaborated using Github and various web tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were getting the individual times of work and breaks to run in succession one after the other as opposed to running asynchronously in Javascript. The times would all run at the same time, our goal was to have a work time followed by a break time countdown continuing until the total time is elapsed. The way we solved the problem was by setting the total time elapsed as a set variable and subtracting the work/break time from that value. The program would check to see if that value was the current value, the time elapsed value would be subtracted again.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to create a simple but useful web app in a short amount of time. The program functions exactly as we had envisioned and its simplicity allows it to function without error.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that even seemingly simple apps are very complicated underneath and require a lot of time and planning to execute. I learned that it is better to focus on something small and making it high quality rather than rushing a large project and making it low quality.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to create a android/ios app for mobile users and develop a more advanced notification system. Our end goal would be to have it on all platforms as a useful tool for anyone who wants to manage their time productively.
