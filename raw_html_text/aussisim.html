                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The stock market, I suppose. The name came because the only data I could find to test it with was Australian Foreign Exchange data. Go figure, huh?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes in historical tick data in a very specific format, and runs through it. Has an interface for connection. Interfaces with a secondary 'User' class which is instantiated and used in a main file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathon, bro. No sleep, 24 hours of code. Or, I started at 11, so more like 12 or so hours of code. I'm high key about to pass out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, I managed to write code for nearly 9 hours straight and ran into nearly no issues. So, I'm about 99% sure I died and went to some form of Nirvanna. Either that or I fell asleep and this is all a dream.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nearly five hundred lines of working code in 9 hours. Not too shabby, I'd say.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The different types of ways to interface with the stock market, basically. I mean obviously this isn't optimal for a time-sensitive algorithm, but it has the underlying technology. It just needs more data, and, well, an algorithm.
