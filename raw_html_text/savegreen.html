                    You can use SaveGreen to put in your income and discover how much you should save per month and what you can spend on each month with our budget tool. You can also save and create your goals (things you would like to buy or pay off) on the goal screen to keep track of what you need/want to pay off. This app helps to make managing your budget easier.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android studio in the language of java.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saving the goals from one screen to the next (not deleting the ArrayList), and making it serializable.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the logo we created,
the listview of goals that we were able to implement, and
the friendships that grew between us during this event.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to start new activities and passing data between them.
                    <br>
                    Xml file layouts and how to implement them.

                    What's next for SaveGreen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would add more features like tax returns and estimates of how many months you would have to save for to accomplish your goals. We would also make it more aesthetically pleasing.
