                    Problem Statement: Unleash Airport experience.
Detailed Solution:
We have used a three phase approach to achieve a hack into this problem. The idea is to provide a platform that combines several services to cater to the needs of a highly diverse audience. This has been implemented in the form of a mobile application.
 We aim to improve the experience of the user from the moment the user starts his/her journey to the airport. The chances that a user would miss a flight are greatly determined by the traffic on the way to the airport. We shall provide well in advance cab booking service through partner cab companies which is enabled by real time traffic data from Google Maps. The information related to delays in the departure of the customer&rsquo;s flight is also sent directly to the mobile application in real time.
The second phase involves the check-in and security scanning procedures. At this stage, a majority of first time users face trouble in navigating through the airport as they don&rsquo;t have the prior knowledge/experience to go through all the procedures with fluidity. We aim to provide this fluidity to each and every user, irrespective of the frequency of travel. Here we shall use geo tagging and pinging the mobile devices of the user using Bluetooth Low Energy beacons installed throughout the airport. These are low cost highly efficient Bluetooth devices, which we have prototyped using ATMEGA328P microcontroller. The user shall be provided with uniquely tailored instructions that need to be followed to gain a seamless experience throughout the check-in procedures, starting from baggage deposit, all the way up to security checks. We aim to make even the first time fliers completely self-reliant, so as to provide them a hassle-free travel experience. This shall be enabled by features such as access to indoor map of the airport, navigation direction provision to nearby locations inside.
The third phase targets improving the customer experience in the boarding area that is during the time spend waiting for boarding to begin. At an average, 35-45 minutes are wasted waiting for the boarding to begin at the gates. This time can be utilized to provide something extremely useful to the users. People who are interested in sharing of knowledge and ideas can use the platform to meet and communicate with like-minded people, hence providing a highly productive way to spend the time otherwise mostly spent doing nothing. The same data can also be used for co-passenger profiling service, and the data collected over time along with a possibility of social media account linking can be used for pattern recognition and further analysis.
We have also studied various use cases, and the various types of users who visit the airport. This includes people with special needs such as senior citizens, pregnant women, and disabled people, business class travelers and others. We aim to provide a highly personalized experience to the diversity of users we are serving. For example, people with special needs may be benefitted by the service of ordering food on their respective seats/wheelchairs. This is achieved together with the concept of physical web and collaborating with restaurants in the food court. 
The screenshots of the app designs are included in the PPT. We have also attached the source code of the app, installer package, a mock data set used for achieving operations, an introductory video and Arduino source code for the beacon prototype.
