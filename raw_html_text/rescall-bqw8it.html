                    Inspiration I am an orthopaedic surgery resident, who thought of the idea of an electronic call sheet while being busy on hospital call.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The app digitizes the call information transfer process, so that every member of the call team is synced at all times. Typically, the junior resident (me) gets a call about a patient, write the information on paper, then find my senior resident to transfer the information in person. With a digital call information system, all I would have to do is enter the information, and every person on my team will know about the patient.

                <h2>
                    The app was built with javascript, mysql, node, and express on backened, and jQuery for frontend.

                    Challenges I ran into: minor issues with tweaking the frontend.
