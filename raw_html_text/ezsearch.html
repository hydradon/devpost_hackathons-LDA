                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Browsing multiple sites on the internet on an android device is often a pain. Unlike a laptop or PC, keeping track of multiple tabs open on an android device, plus searching for the same thing again and again is a lot more tedious as well as prone to errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EzSearch is an app that allows the user to input a group of words as keywords for their search, and then proceeds to provide easy-to-navigate links and in some cases embedded web pages for the given set of words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Noticing how any website with a search function has a generic URL format, we used string concatenation along with MIT App Inventor's Web Viewer and Activity Manager function to embed web pages and access the browser app on the device with the same url, to produce the search as a direct result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was a huge challenge that we ran into, with MIT App Inventor's lack of a copy-paste function on front-end development. This also posed a hurdle while polishing UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to embed Web Pages for Google as well as Wikipedia results directly into the application. We were also able to enable email authentication with verification as a login method.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a huge deal about database management, HTML embedding as well as accessing different features of an android device through code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EzSearch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the next step, we intend to embed web pages for many more E-Commerce websites online, as well as polishing of UI, and publish the app on the play store.
