                    Once you reach the Coca-Cola cooler that contains your drink, you encounter me, the tablet you are reading from. Next, please choose the beverage you are purchasing so I can manage my inventory and also because I want to make sure I have your drink at all times!
                </p>
                <p>
                    After you choose the drink you're purchasing, you can take a "selfie" and share your enjoyment via Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and various other social medias. The selfie will be taken from the tablet that is mounted on the
Coca-Cola cooler and using the front-facing camera the user can snap a selfie to be shared!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Posting the selfie to a social media site enters you for a chance to win 1 FREE COKE! #smileforthecoke

                <p>
                    Marketing opportunities are endless. Why?
First, since there is a live check for users to see if a store contains a drink, it gives the store owner the incentive to always stay stocked up because they don't want their product availabities to show as "unavailable".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why would the customer want to help keep inventory and even use the app? Well, there's a free on the spot
Coke product if they submit a selfie to social media. This could be a marketing campaign called #smileforthecoke
Also, humans are social creatures and they want to take pictures and post it to their friends to see.
"Hey, look! I got just bought a Coke!" This is basically "sharing" a coke through social media.

                    <strong>
                        Scenario 1:
                    </strong>
                    A dehydrated tourist is walking around the streets of Atlanta where he is in dire need for a ice cold "refresh-ing" Sprite. So he goes to a store and they happen to be out of Sprite, but they do have Coke! He doesn't want a Coke. Oh no....! Okay... now I want my next favorite drink... a Pepsi...."
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Scenario 2:
                    </strong>
                    A dehydrated tourist is walking around the streets of Atlanta where he is in dire need for a ice cold "refresh-ing" Sprite. So he takes out his phone and goes to findmycoke.xyz, where he then taps on a Sprite. He walks directly to the store that provides his desired beverage. He sees he can win another Sprite 
cause of the "Win a FREE coke" button. He clicks it and then picks a Sprite cause thats what he is purchasing. He then takes the selfie so he has the chance to win another drink by posting the selfie to Facebook for all of his friends to see which was taken by the tablet on the door where he is cheesing with an ice cold refreshing Sprite! Ahhh... another satisfied customer and a great way to include social media marketing.

                    This solution collects different user inputs from each cooler and determines if the cooler needs to be restocked with one or more different products.

                <p>
                    The cost to implement this solution is approximately $40 - 70 per cooler.
It only costs a tablet that is capable of taking front-facing pictures and a mount for the tablet.
