                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Someday's you just don't know what to do with your free day or you are on vacation but don't have a plan. What if there was an app that can just tell you what to do and automatically plan out your day for you. Without any site in existence it really inspired us to solve the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based off the user's location the site tells you where you should go for Breakfast,Lunch and Dinner and activities you can do throughout the day. On any device, when you are ready to go just click on the location and Google Maps will open giving directions to your location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based off the Google Places API we created an algorithm to pick out the best place for a
the certain part of the day. Also, we included user options like price range and favorite cuisine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Biggest challenge was determining the algorithm to pick the best location most suitable for the part of the day. We were able to achieve a very good suggestions by the end of the project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing the project to what we pictured from the beginning was our biggest accomplishment.
