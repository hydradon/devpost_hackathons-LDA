                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I (Clark) got tired of being woken up by my alarm when school was closed, so this app aims to allow people to sleep in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You put in when your classes/activities are, and how long before the first one you want to wake up. If school is open on time, you will wake up the specified time before your first class. If school is closed, you will wake up at another time of your choosing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app itself is written in Flutter/Dart and the server is written in Flask/Python. The server handles scraping the UMD alerts webpage to see if school is closed and has a GET endpoint which responds with when school is closed.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew Flutter or Dart (and we still don't). However, through the power of internet searches and Stack Overflow we prevailed.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we had no experience with Flutter or mobile development in general we all helped each other out and combined our knowledge in order to complete this project.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of Flutter and Dart.

                    What's next for School Closure Alarm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to make it work more like a native alarm app i.e. wake up the screen when your alarm goes off not just send a notification.
