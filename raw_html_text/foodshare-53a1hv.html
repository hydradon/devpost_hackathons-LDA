                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students do not opt for the full meal plan because of how expensive it is and thus often do not eat proper meals. As a result, they fall sick during important periods of the semester. Moreover, there are many first-year students who have extra meals every week that go wasted. Our team wanted to solve this problem with FoodShare.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app matches students without dining hall meals to students with extra meals. The two students who are matched then chat on the app to determine further details.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We built it by dividing tasks and working as a team. We used Node, Express, and Mongodb to code the application.
