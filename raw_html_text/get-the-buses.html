                    We can't evacuate people if we don't have the vehicles in time to transport them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our solution matches buses with an extended database of possible drivers in realtime to provide the optimal resources to an evacuation event.

                <p>
                    We've learned a ton from the mentors on the ground to help formulate the problem we are attacking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will combine the net new functionality of driver repository and realtime matching between drivers and buses with existing Rally tech for dynamic routing and tracking buses, drivers, and riders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've kept the technological scope lean to simplify solution development toward getting this to market faster.
