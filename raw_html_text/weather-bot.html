                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, I (Leon) was walking back to my dorm with several large, heavy bags in hand. The sky was overcast and a chilly breeze floated through the air.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Good thing it isn't raining," I thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then it started raining.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I raced back to shelter as fast as I could, but since I was weighted down by the bags, I only managed to make it to safety several miserable minutes later. I was drenched from head to toe, as I had no umbrella. I shivered as I tried to get dry, and said to myself, "From now on, I will never leave the safety of the indoors without checking the weather ever again."
                </p>
                <p>
                    That lasted about two days before I gave up on that. Checking the weather channel every day was inconvenient and in my groggy state just after waking, I wasn't eager to stare at my phone's screen first thing in the morning. I needed a better solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the help of the experienced mentors from Intuit and Honeywell (Jonah from the former in particular), online tutorials, and hours of sustained effort, we eventually began putting together the pieces that we needed for a functioning weather bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Above all else, the frustration at getting the same error over and over, yet not understanding why, made us struggle with the project. Despite the project's deceiving simplicity (or perhaps because of it), we would often spend much time and energy on finding the source of the mistake. Spending many hours on one problem without seeming to make any progress made the work difficult to enjoy at times--but the joy that came with breakthroughs was worth it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Weather Bot:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add a number of features, such as automating Weather Bot's messages, allowing others to subscribe to Weather Bot's messages and set their preferences (such as Fahrenheit/Celsius as well as notification frequency), among others. In general, our goal is to take our solution to the weather problem and share it with everyone who wants it.
