                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every year, thousands of people are injured or even die due to pothole-related incidents. Many roads are left not maintained as they remain undetected. This is detrimental to the infrastructure of a country and we wanted to solve the problem simply yet effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patcher integrates image recognition in a raspberry pi to detect potholes on roads and sends a location marker and an alert to the appropriate departments in the city. It can be easily attached to the windshield of public transport vehicles without any need to modify the vehicle itself
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used  Clairifai and Image recognition and sent it to a raspberry pi to detect potholes. They were uploaded to a firebase server, where the location is stored and can be accessed
