                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all avid gamers who aspire to contribute back to the gaming community. Our desire to elevate the current quality of gaming inspired us to provide a thrilling experience for all ages. The challenge and opportunity to use hardware and software from Oculus Rifts and Myo armbands was one experience we couldn't pass away.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our easy to use interface allows users to create their own adventure with the freedom of virtual reality and gesture control systems.  Our spooky theme augments the user's experience by invoking surreal interactions such as the intense combats against ghouls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, the user enters a dark world with only the aid of a flashlight, delivering a rush of adrenaline. The user can explore different aspects of the world such as the crates, puddles, and oil tanker. Then, the user battles randomly spawned ghosts with the flashlight which scare the user. The health decreases gradually when the ghosts hits the users. The goal of the game is to survive and accumulate points by defeating ghosts. It leaves the user exhilarated and eager for more action.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it on the Unity Framework with APIs and SDKs from Thalmic Labs and Oculus. We rendered 3D objects with Blender for high quality transformations between scripts and objects. In addition, we customized Myo gestures with our C# scripts to authenticate user control over their environment. Specifically, we applied mathematics to create emulate real life gestures like the act of turning charging a flashlight. In addition, with the help of Unity's GameObjects and Components, we were able to include various aspects of physics in our game.  Finally, we optimized the Oculus Rift for the best overall experience. We made this experience as realistic as we could with the help of various cameras and input sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While writing the Myo scripts, we ran into obfuscating problems that required scrupulous debugging and analysis. 
The time crunch challenged us to delegate tasks and organize our software development in an efficient manner. Our inexperience with Unity led us to have challenges imposed by the strict rules and hierarchy of Game Objects. Also, the endurance of learning 3D rendering for the first time led to many hours spent learning on online resources for Blender, leading us to a compromise for our projected features. Furthermore, interacting with the Myo armband exposed the absence of certain contrary to our pre-conceived notions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the great learning curve of designing  3D objects and programming in Unity for the first time required diligent effort and collaboration on all parts.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that We are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fully grasping the foundations of Unity, Myo, and Oculus as well as developing a tangible product, gave us a great sense of accomplishment. Also, the various leadership roles that each member took upon catalyzed productivity and innovation.  Furthermore, the creation of a tangible product from programmers who met on social networks was a great achievement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to apply and combine our different skill sets to the best of our abilities. In general, we learned to combat the inevitable circumstance of running into coding issues by seeking aid from peers, mentors, and online resources. We granted ourselves many opportunities to program efficiently by staying positive and remembering to have fun.
