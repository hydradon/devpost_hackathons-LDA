                    We wanted to make something that's accessible from anywhere. We like classic games and wanted to code one ourselves. Our program gives an option of three games, and lets user choose continuously until bored. It uses GUI's and other Java methods. We split up each game into parts and divided and conquered. We originally had a different idea, but had to use a server. We decided to scrap it and use another one. We ran into some small flaws in code, but quickly fixed it. We are really proud of one game, the 15 puzzle one. We learned planning does not always go the way you want it but by dividing and conquering you can finish anything. We hope to make more and better JAVA games. We also hope to upload to Internet.
