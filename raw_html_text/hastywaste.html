                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the technology embedded into our daily lives, we decided to harness this potential by creating a smarter waste management solution for the 21st Century.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every bin has multiple sensors, such as ultrasonic and moisture sensors, to capture real-time data. It is then processed and using machine learning, optimizes things such as times of collection and maintenance, saving money for the company and reducing a carbon footprint on the earth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django to write the core functionality of our web program, using HTML/CSS to display it to our users. To capture, store, and analyze our data, we read and processed raw data from our Arduino Uno, and stored it into a MongoDB database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using asynchronous calls within python was a big challenge in getting real-time updates for notifying the employee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement real-time tracking for a live demonstration for one of our bins. Additionally, we implemented individual user login, which allows for multiple employees to use the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With proper planning and good teamwork, you can go farther than you think. Additionally, the implementation of hardware was very interesting and took less time than we thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HastyWaste
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement GPS tracking systems for all bins, allowing them to be in a meshed network of bins across a office, city, or even state. We would also like to use API's such as Esri's ArcGIS to map and plan the fastest, most efficient route for collection.
