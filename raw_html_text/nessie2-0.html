                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wants to try an API because was too difficult, scary, and hard to plan, especially for freshman in high school.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application ideally performs the basics of a bank, including transferring, depositing, withdrawing, loan, and more with our app. Two features are original to our app, we have a Gift Maker, where you can put money onto debit cards, which you can give as gifts. Another feature, which isn't ready yet, is the feature to create and perform a budget, in order to save for a rainy day and for retirement.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Notepad++ and Atom to code the bulk of our code. We had independent versions running on all of our 4 computers, which later were later combined to create our current version.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many challenges, especially with the slower WiFi, server problems, library errors, and more. We spent hours at the CapitalOne Technology Desk trying to fix our errors with their expertise.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to work together as a team to create a professional looking and performing web application. We plan to host this with an Email and Password Database system and on a domain.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that despite many long difficulties we faced, and the many times we wanted to give up, the end product made us feel proud about ourselfs and eachother, that hacking is an amazing way to not only become better at coding, but to bond with your friends.

                    What's next for Nessie2.0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to switch to a email and password system, as well as a domain to host on. We want to encrypt our data, and make an Android and iOS app. We had a sample Android app, but we scratched it due to the lack of time.
