                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is a part of the SustainLA track and it has to do with being more green in our everyday lives. It has aspects of recycling, being more environmentally knowledgeable, and in return for using our application. One can receive prizes and discounts. We believe our app is original because this could really be an app that encourages students and people in general to be more green. The best way to make a difference is to become more informed in why changes need to done. Too many times we see trash on the floor and trash that isn&rsquo;t in its particular recycling bin. This is why Green on the Go is something entirely new but a solution to continuing problems such as greenhouse gasses, pollution, habitat destruction, and global warming. All these disasters occur due to our doing of not recycling correctly or not even recycling at all. Our app is a step in the right direction in being more kind to our home, Earth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Green on the Go application is a mobile application that aids the user to identify whether the item in their hand is thrown in recycling, compost, etc. The application also informs the user about facts on nature trivia. Another thing the Green on the Go application does is encourage the user to go out, make a change, and get rewards for doing so.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and C# as our IDE, Android as the mobile platform, and Vuforia to implement the Augmented Reality portion of the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Augmented Reality was completely new to all members of the group. The majority of the group was completely new to both C# and Unity. The group had problems implementing buttons and requested help from engineer mentors from AppLovin available in the hackathon. 
We attempted to implement Twilio into our app for trivia about nature and how humanity impacts wildlife and the ecosystem, both good and bad, however, it was unsuccessful. Twilio would not work with Unity and Vuforia after a considerable amount of time and we found that the available work arounds would require even more unknown knowledge and time. It was not optimal to learn a new language and considering the time restraints, we agreed to use toasts as an alternative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We overcame the struggles that took us an inordinate amount of time. The most notable struggle was trying to implement the &ldquo;back&rdquo; feature. 
We are proud to have implemented toasts without having to rely on the Android and Java assistance which was the easiest solution because Android and Java had conflicts with Vuforia. We implemented toast in a expedited manner despite multiple roadblocks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned that AR is not an easy thing to do but it is so versatile in the aspect of usage. It takes a little thinking out of the box but it is quite amazing to have the ability to bring in something virtual into our own real world. We also learned that communication and teamwork is key to a not so rocky hackathon. A majority of the team is new to hackathon's so it was really awesome to see the obstacles arise and us as a team resolve them. Another thing we learned is that it is pretty tricky to implement Twilio into Unity, which was one of our initial ideas but unfortunately had to erase. Overall the whole experience was a self reflecting lesson, it taught us what we are good at and what we need to work on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Green on the Go
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Green on the Go application is meant to be used for all generations to go out and make our planet clean and long lasting. In the future we would like to get sponsors to aid us in giving our users rewards for helping save the earth and in doing so will decrease the amount of waste. We are also thinking about implementing machine learning into the application to help recognize many more items efficiently.
