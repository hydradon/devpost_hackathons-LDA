                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the RPG Dungeons and Dragons, and were encouraged to create the app due to the lack of dice rollers available for the Samsung Gear S2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app generates a random integer within a range determined by the user's dice selection. The user can choose to roll a 4-sided die, 6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, or 20-sided die
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java in Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to make the app work in android wear, and we  were unable to make android studio run on linux
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make the app work with mobile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had previously not had any experience with Android studio, and one team member had no experience with Java, so this experience provided a lot of opportunities for both team members to gain experience with android development and Java.
                </p>

                    What's next for DiceRoller
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make DiceRoller compatible with android wear and to add animations for each of the rolling dice.
