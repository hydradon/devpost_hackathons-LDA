                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We received an Amazon Echo Dot for Christmas and immediately were excited about the possibilities of what the machine could do!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to add characters of their own making into existing story outlines.  For example, they might choose two main characters: a girl moose named Melissa, and a boy rabbit named Brandon.  Then the story is read back by Alexa, with those two as the main characters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used the Amazon Developer Console and AWS Lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the way of thinking for developing an Alexa skill was tough at times.  Also my node.js skills are somewhat rusty!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of how fast it came together.  I found out about the Alexa contest just five days before the submission date.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        It is good to have the full idea in mind before starting an Alexa project.  2. Refresher on my node.js skills  3. Be sure to save before testing
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    What's next for Silly Animal Stories
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to keep adding more fun stories that use the full breadth of options available.  Including sound clips, whispering, and other SSML formatting.
