                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired us is that there aren't many women in stem majors, and our mission is to connect and support
STEM women in their acknowledgement of personal and professional atmospheres for women in STEM fields at various companies and university departments.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People can navigate to our universities or companies tab to write a review on their personal or professional journey with those organizations. Individuals should feel free to include their overall satisfaction, perceived gender equality, and whether they would recommend their experience to other women

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some people on our team never coded before, and it was difficult. We persevered through and helped each
other and collaborated with other members who have had more experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of ourselves for doing something we've never done before and getting out of our comfort zone.

                <p>
                    We learned to work together in a team and strengthen our leadership skills. We never met each other before, and we made new networks. It was awesome working together!
