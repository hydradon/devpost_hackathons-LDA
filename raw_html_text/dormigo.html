                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, college roommate searching is done via Facebook. People will post a profile in the general class group, for example, the Virginia Tech Class of 2019 page. Since this is a general page, it is easy to miss a profile as hundreds of people post. The current state of dorm roommate searching is unorganized, inefficient and clutters the group page. In addition, it is often awkward to find out all of the necessary information about each other, and eventually "pop the question." It takes courage to build up to asking someone if they want to room, as you both do an awkward sort of dance around each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application creates a profile for each new user, complete with their answers to a number of vital questions. We have created an algorithm that determines the percentage of compatibility of each person in the database. We then have a very comprehensive list of matches that you can choose to chat, get rid of forever, or select intent to room. This gets rid of the awkward question popping, as, like Tinder, your match can only see that you want to room with them if they also choose to room with you.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out Parse and MongoDB. We also had issues with formatting and carrying data from one page to another.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our unique solution to a common problem, using the full capabilities of the Parse and MongoDB databases (storing and accessing string values and integer values, and comparing this data). We are also proud of our formatting and attention to detail.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned all about Parse and MongoDB. We also became a lot more competent in CSS, HMTL and javascript.
                </p>

                    What's next for Dormigo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to improve chat functionality, as well as add to the survey questions and improve the algorithm. We want to add more colleges and reach a larger number of users.
