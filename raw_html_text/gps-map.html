                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was we wanted to play with something new
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works by passing a GPS cordinate into an sql database which comunicates with our website and ouputs a pin with the location from the dragonboard
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built using a dragonBoard, google maps api, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and Rust.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems getting the dragon board set up. We also struggled with having google maps api with setting the location for pins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we tried something new! We used a hardware we had never used before and we learned how to use an api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use a dragon board, how to use rust, and how to use google maps api
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GPS Map
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand it so the boards GPS can communicate more efficiently with the database and store multiple pins at once.
