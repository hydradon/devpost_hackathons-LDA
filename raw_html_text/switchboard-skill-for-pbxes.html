                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an assistant Alexa should become your personal secretary, too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It dials calls for you on your regular phone. So you don't have to search, open the dialer, and search for the number any more. Instead talk to the switchboard skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made a voice interface to PBXes virtual phone systems. That's where you can connect your smartphones etc. over the standard SIP protocol to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of, first I had to learn about account linking to connect to the right virtual PBX. Second, the skill has to understand all kinds of place names e.g. the local surf club to find the corresponding phone numbers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill can really understand nearby place names, contact names, and numbers. So I can voice dial everyone just like talking to a good secretary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about current limitations some really huge and some smaller of the Alexa skills kit.
                </p>

                    What's next for Switchboard skill for PBXes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am waiting for an API to run the actual phone calls over echo devices itself, rather than via smartphone.
