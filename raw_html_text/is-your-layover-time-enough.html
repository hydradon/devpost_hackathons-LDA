                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I missed my second flight(Charlotte to Daytona) on my way to HackRiddle 2017  because my first flight(Chicago to Charlotte) was delayed and I just had 36 min layover time at Charlotte which wasn't enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to which I reached around 7pm instead of 11 am. So I decided to build something which someone can use to get a rough estimate of delay.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gets the average Delay time of the first flight, adds time to change gates(set to 10min as best case scenario could take even more ) then checks if the layover time in your ticket would be enough or not and if you should book that ticket.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made a web scrapper using Java and Jsoup which scraps the avg delay time from website. I hosted this scrapper, which acts like my backend on AWS EC2 machine using tomcat7 server. Then created front end for this website  using Angular 4 and made REST calls to the scrapper to get the data. Just for change I hosted the front end app on AWS S3

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Getting avg time was difficult, there were api's but I didn't use them for two reasons
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I would have to pay for every REST request made
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using api's would have been easy, building a own scrapper was difficult and hacking
                    </li>
                </ol>
