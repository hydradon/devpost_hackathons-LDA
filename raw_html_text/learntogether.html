                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a group of college students looking for a more efficient method to find peers to study and connect with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app prompts the user for their name and class they are working on. With the user's consent, the app then retrieves their location using Google-maps and generates a list of users within a certain radius who are working on the same class. The user is then given the option to message anyone on the list if they wish to connect or meet up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used VSCode as our IDE to develop the back-end code. We then developed html files to transfer the information onto the actual web. We also implemented the Google-maps API to enable the location feature and present a visualization of the user's location to the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to use the Firebase database. However, with no prior experience, we were unable to figure out how to store and sort through all of our potential user data using Firebase within the given time constraint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully implemented the Google-maps API and created a user-friendly interface that is simple and easy to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned what API's are and how to implement them as well as some HTML. We learned about the general concept of Firebase and are excited to submit our first Hackathon project!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LearnTogether
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to eventually make it into an IOS app that will allow users to create a permanent profile and connect with past study buddies. We would also like to implement the Snapchat API to show Bitmojis on the app. We would also like to enable users to search through multiple classes at a time.
