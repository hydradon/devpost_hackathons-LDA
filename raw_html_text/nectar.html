                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a way to keep track of your own skincare routines and how that changes based on time of day (morning vs. night) and climate. This stemmed from our own experiences wanting to know which ingredients worked best for our skin and to be able to find recommendations based on products we already used. We also wanted to lower the barrier to entry for anyone who wants to learn more about their skin and we drew inspiration from skincare quizzes that help people find out their skin types.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first have a quiz for new users to take whether they want Nectar to recommend them a skincare routine from scratch (Build Your Own) or to Evaluate their current routine.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Build Your Own
                </h3>
                <p>
                    routine would take the information (skin type, age range, key areas of interest such as sun protection or acne-prone) and allow the user to filter products based on those factors. We would use Sephora's product API to get each product's information.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Evaluate
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Using dermatologist recommendations, Nectar would provide those wanting a skincare routine evaluation information on which products that they use work together or do not work together based on their ingredients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it

                    Android Studio, Adobe Illustrator

                    More features: Explore page for other user's skincare routines, or celebrity skincare products
A pimple tracker (like a period tracker) where you record information about the pimple and track it's (hopeful) death
Product review similar to Sephora's BeautyTalk where users can freely share their experiences with products.
