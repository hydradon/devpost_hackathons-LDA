                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After submitting the paperwork required to attend Hack TJ 6.0, we decided that there should be an easier and more effective way to fill out the paperwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app takes a picture of a paper form and then it converts it to HTML format. This HTML can be exported for further use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a combination of Java, HTML, and Android Studio to create the app. We used the Google Cloud Vision API as the photo recognition software and formatted the result into parsable HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many extremely difficult problems, including ineffective equipment, image size limits across app transitions, implementation errors with imported text recognition libraries, translating what we wanted to do through multiple languages, finding appropriate hosts for our server, and many other problems we do not like remembering. Our biggest problem by far was a mass-corruption of nearly all our files due to the quality of the IDE we used (Android Studio).

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that even with our project getting corrupted and losing a lot of progress, we managed to finish it with time to spare and test the text to HTML conversion on different forms of different sizes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Android Studio can be a risky IDE to work with, some of us also learned a couple new languages to make the process of creating it easier, and with three of us being new to Hackathons, we also learned how to plan out a project and divide up the work to easy the process
                </p>

                    What's next for Picture Docs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, there would be a more streamlined input for photos, better HTML formatting, hosting forms on a server, and more options for exporting forms.
