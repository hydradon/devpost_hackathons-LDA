                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a Visual Novel.  Our inspiration is a Visual Novel called Butterfly Soup and we wanted to create a fun story with lovable characters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can click through each scene to meet all of our characters and understand the premise of the story.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Renpy to code the project, drew all of the art, and composed a theme song that plays throughout the story.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each team member have very different talents, so coordinating all of the parts of the project and combining our individual styles was challenging.  In addition, learning a new framework was a challenge since we were unfamiliar with Renpy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having a varied soundtrack and producing a lot of artwork by different artists who were able to match each other's styles.  We managed to write a cohesive story in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A new coding medium and how to customize our own Visual Novel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Boiling Point
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to finish the story and make it complete with two different paths the reader can take to see different perspectives of the story and develop our characters.
