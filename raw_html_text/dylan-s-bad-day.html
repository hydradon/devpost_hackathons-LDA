                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the stress of the election and the stress of a long week of classes, this team was having a difficult time preparing for VandyHacks. We were all very excited for the event, but sometimes, after a stressful week, even the most enjoyable things seem hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was out of this shared sentiment that Dylan's Bad Day was born. The game addresses a heroic challenge, but not the slaying of a dragon or the rescuing of a princess. Dylan's Bad Day is a game that celebrates the heroic effort it takes to get out of bed in the morning, participate in social activity, and do the work you have to do just to make it through the day. It is the depiction of what it means to battle your own fears and inhibitions in order to truly live.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is time we start heroizing what it means to participate and try in life because that, in itself, is heroic. So we hope you enjoy Dylan's Bad Day, and we hope you know that everything is going to be okay.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dylan's Bad Day places you in the shoes of college student Dylan. Dylan awakes in his own bed one morning, but he soon finds that it is very difficult to get out of bed. In order for Dylan to make it out of bed he must collect enough dopamine! He then finds himself challenged with meeting a friend for lunch and writing an essay. In each case, Dylan must overcome his own social anxieties and fears in order to make it through the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Python 3 scripting language in conjunction with pygame modules to create an immersive game experience. Multiple mini-games were created and embedded into the main game so that the play-through is seamless and each mini-game adds to the overall narrative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one of our team members had worked with the pygame library before, so there was a learning curve for the rest of the team to actualize our ideas in the scope of the pygame library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to finish an entire video game in the span of a weekend, starting from the ground up. Also we are proud of our use of the pygame library, and how we embedded the mini-games into the overall narrative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the pygame library, and how to make video games within video games and deal with the error associated with nested update steps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dylan's Bad Day
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We already have a plethora of ideas for expanding and editing Dylan's Bad Day. We would like to see the "brain games" become more visual and involved, and we are already working on including more brain physiology into the game's concept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like to add more levels with more complex "brain games" to expand the game's play time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also want to incorporate the current research that links relaxation to certain musical tones. We would like to pair the game with music that creates a relaxing atmosphere in which to play the game.
