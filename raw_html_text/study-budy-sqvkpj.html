                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is not a very good (online) way to connect with fellow students in a class to plan study sessions. You have to go through the process of first making friends (oh the horror) then testing each other's study abilities, going through the rigorous process of planning a time to study etc. Its awful.
We wanted a way to easily connect with fellow students, plan study sessions, and ensure they get done and are efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to connect to fellow students and schedule group study sessions (or private tutor sessions)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used PHP, html, javasript, ajax, jquery and mysql
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    time and sleep deprivation were our biggest challenges.
                </p>

                <p>
                    How far we got on the idea in such a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    that you should get a good night of sleep the night before a hackathon

                    Lots of new features as well as &gt;24 hours worth of development.
