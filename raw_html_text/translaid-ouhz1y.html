                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Effective communication that breaks language barrier.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Register Hand gestures using a Myo armband which is fetched by an Arduino UNO board and translated into text to be read by a processing script that displays speech. Not only does our program output to our laptop's display and its sound system, but we also outputted to an external lcd to show the possibilities of implementing a mobile product with its sole processor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lua script was developed to convert raw data, using the API provided by ThalmicLabs, to input directed to an Arduino code that process the text and uses sound libraries to produce speech sounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting familiar with Myo Armband API and usage.
Calibration of the Myo Armband.
Producing input that could be fetched by the Arduino Uno board.
Google Translated was attempted however Google Translate API was not free to public consumers.
                </p>
