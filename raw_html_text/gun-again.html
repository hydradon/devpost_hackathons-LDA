                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mad Max; the want to learn more about VR and a paid tutorial for Blender that we didn't want to spend money on.
                </p>

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gunner is a VR shooter game where you ride in the back of a truck and shoot vehicles in front of you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is made in Unity and runs using C#. We built the models using Maya and touched them up with sculpting from Blender.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Git was giving us issues for about an hour including a folder that wasn't supposed to be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How much work we could get done in 24 hours. It was a good test to see how far we could get.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Git hates SteamVR, we learned how to set up A LOT of the VR stuff.
                </p>

                    What's next for Gunner:
