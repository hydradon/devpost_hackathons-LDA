                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't have an idea until like 5pm.
I was too busy socialising and getting stickers and putting them on my laptop
I wanted to make a game with unusual inputs, and use Unity to build it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At about 4.30 I realised I wanted to make a controller using my Makey Makey and a sheet of paper.
I couldn't find any paper, but I did find a MLH bag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The whole game theme was built around that, with all the platforms being mlh stickers and the background being my laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a game.
some people found it fun, some found it frustrating to play with the terrible controller I built.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The paper bag had crocodile clips attached to the side, then i drew thick lines that led to big buttons on it in pencil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game was made in unity, I took pictures of some stickers, cut them out in an image editor to give them transparent backgrounds then made them objects in unity.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    THE PENCIL GRAPHITE IS NOT A GREAT CONDUCTOR

                <p>
                    Made a decent game in such short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a better understanding of creating 2D games in unity.
