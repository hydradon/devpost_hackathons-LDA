                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a TA for a class on data analysis. I have been meaning to make a tutorial on data analysis for the students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This code processes handwriting data (0's and 1's) from the MNIST dataset. It uses the Histogram Orient Gradient (HOG) method to process png images (after some pre-processing) and then performs SVM classification on them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used handwriting images from the MNIST handwriting database. I put 0's into a folder called "Zero" and 1's into a folder called "One."  I implemented the algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to write a decent tutorial. But, more importantly, that I need to manage my time better so that I am not doing academic work during hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SVM Classification with HOG Image Processing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm going to make it so that it classifies more than just 0's and 1's.
