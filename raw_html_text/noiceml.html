                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we did come to HackTCNJ to create an innovative product, we had another goal: a large problem that we felt needed to be fixed. That problem was the fact that a lot of information exists that people need, yet they are unable to acquire it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you go to our site, you will be greeted with a split screen with a live translated video on the left and space for your notes on the right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our application using the google-cloud speech to text and translation api's and python. Through the use of linearization algorithms, we were able to determine the breaks between sentences and then use text to speech to convert it back to audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was that our Dragonboard wasn't working because of a corrupted Operating System. We reflashed it with a new operating system but it took up a lot of time and was a major challenge for us as no python commands worked in bash. 
Our other challenge was finding accurate locations for each sentence in the text version of the file. Because google-cloud isn't perfect and there were a multitude of missing/misinterpreted words, we had to come up with a good linearization algorithm to find locations (in terms of timestamps) of each sentence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our project works thanks to our lack of sleep.

                    We learned how to use the Google Cloud Platform and React.js with flask
