                    What is our goal?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To provide a safe and comfortable networking system for women in tech, by building relationships between students in the related field with industry professionals
-we want our web application to be recognized as a welcoming community to share ideas and difficulties that one may have encountered or faced when studying or working in this industry
-Also hope that this web application can encourage others to empower other women in tech, and that they are not the only ones who are sometimes uncomfortable in such a male dominant field
Statistics have shown that these are the leading causes for women not to pursue a career in technology:

                <h2>
                    How does our idea work?

                <p>
                    You are either a mentee or a mentor:
A mentee is: Someone who is currently studying in the field of technology (such as computer science, software systems, or engineering etc) who is seeking personal advice on how to cope with certain situations or asking mentors their experiences and difficulties getting a job in the tech industry
A mentor is: someone who is voluntarily willingly to help with a &ldquo;mentee&rdquo;, and to provide professional advice from their own experiences working the the tech, and the difficulties they might have faced.

                <h2>
                    MENTORS/REQUEST FORMS:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -&gt; we have these request forms so we allow the control to the mentors, they are the core of our web application. They will be the ones communicating with the mentees, and to ensure that the relationship between mentor and mentee is at a personal level, we let the mentor decide how many mentees they can accommodate for
We have MENTOR FORMS for Mentors to fill out:
-how many mentees do they want
-which days of the week they are available,
-how often they meet up with the mentees
                </p>
                <h2>
                    REQUEST FORMS:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Request forms are used so the mentees can send requests to their desired mentors and inform them on what their goals and needs are
-mentees are required to fill out their goals for the future to help mentors understand their needs ( and to see if mentors can cater to these needs)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Main menu:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A mentee with no current mentors can browse through currently available mentors and see through their descriptions, and judge if they are a mentor that they are intrested in establishing a bond with, -&gt; if yes can complete a request form for the mentors to see
                </p>
                <h2>
                    CHAT OPTION:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once a mentee and mentor are linked, they can follow the guidelines that the mentor has provided (the days the mentor is available and how often)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What makes our idea different from the other ones out there?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -our purpose is to have personalized conversations between the mentors and mentees rather than attending an event or hosting an event that is strictly &ldquo;female-based&rdquo;, some girls still might be discouraged to attend to these networking events,-&gt;&gt; so we thought of this option as a stepping stone for those girls who are afraid of attending these events, or those who have no experience in these fields
-the main goal is to tackle the reason why women are afraid or discouraged on being in the tech industry: so our primary focus is to address these problems, such as having a sense of belonging somewhere ( hence the relationship with someone in a related tech field) to see what their struggles were when going along the same path
