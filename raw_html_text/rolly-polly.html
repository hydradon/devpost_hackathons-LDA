                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to combine expertise in many different technical backgrounds to create an interesting project. Additionally, we wanted to  include elements of wireless power.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows players to experience the fun game of pinball.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Carlo worked on the hardware, Amanda did the software and Maryam served as a system integrator, working on both the hardware and software. Although we all focused on our own tasks, communication was strong and the process of building the machine went smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ball kept on getting stuck on the components of the playing board, which took away from the enjoyment of the game. This was fixed by adding extra pieces to the pinball machine to prevent the ball from getting stuck in corners and small gaps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that the pinball machine works  and makes a really satisfying noise when operating the flippers. Additionally, it looks cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to program with the python game library pygame, about interference between electrical components, and the importance of design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rolly Polly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more LEDs, clean up the electronics organization, implement the ball-return system, get the coin-discriminator working properly, optimize the software code and make the pinball machine itself more aesthetically pleasing.
