                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core of Zeleo is a proprietary Rule Engine that generates Clojure code from a JSON rule definition. The events are flat JSON documents that can easily be interrogated by the Rule Builder, and enact any Consequences if the condition is true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When an event comes in, it is stored in a REDIS queue. We have any number (depending on the length of the queue) of microservices monitoring and processing events from this queue; by increasing or decreasing the number of Rule Execution services, we can scale horizontally to handle the load of event traffic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyone can hook any system into Zeleo, for their own team or to publish to the greater Zeleo community.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially used a Drools rule engine, but found quickly that this system was designed with a monolithic architecture in mind. We wanted a low memory microservice architecture to scale horizontally, and as such used Clojure as a DSL to generate and execute rules quickly and efficiently.

                    <li>
                        We were accepted into the Startup health Moonshot Academy, beating ~75 companies in a competition sponsored by Aurora Health.

                    <li>
                        Zeleo was deployed successfully as the backend to Axis, the Care Management product made by AxisPoint Health.
