                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the climate becoming worse and worse we wanted to raise awareness about the environment in order to try and help out and show people how impactful the environment actually is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application uses a plethora of web API's and services to show environment impact. We began using the weather to display how the environment is now and how it would be in the future using maps and images. With Air quality, we decided against showing the future environment and decided to show current ones around the globe. We then did similarly with Floods, Animal, and Seismic activity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we used Php for the backend parsing government CSV files and used API's when necessary to get the necessary data. Then we used Javascript and Bootstrap to make an amazing UI for everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The CSV files turned out to be broken with the government failing to maintain them very last minute realizing that the data was mostly incorrect
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a great UI, made something that would be great for the environment and had a lot of fun
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The government files are very detailed but badly maintained and API are becoming more difficult to acquire and be sure plan ahead next time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GreenLife
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get everything working and hopefully publish this to the public as an open source project.
