                    Nutrifai: Better, healthier lifestyles
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Nutrifai is an app that provides useful information to users about potential nutritional imbalances in their food based on the user's medical history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can create a profile and choose from a list of medical conditions supported by the app, all of which require careful monitoring of one's diet. Once this is done, users can perform a text search for a food they want to eat (via the web app), and find useful information about which foods they can eat safely and which foods they may want to avoid, together with the recommended thresholds based on the user's medical condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest convenience is that users can use the mobile app to log into their accounts, and simply snap a picture of the food they are about to eat. We use Clarifai to perform image recognition on the food, giving the user an instantaneous evaluation.
