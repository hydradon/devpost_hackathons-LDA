                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were partially inspired by Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz while we were thinking of a project to pursue... Hence the Money Exchanginator was born. We wanted to use the Twilio after seeing the demo and also wanted to try applying the banking system.
