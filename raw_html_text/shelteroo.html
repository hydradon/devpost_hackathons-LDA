                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a web application using frameworks we were unfamiliar with. We decided to go with our idea because in a large city like New York there may be many people who are interested in helping pets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows shelters to look for volunteers, and for people to search for shelters to volunteer at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using SQL, Flask for the backend and html and css for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all relatively new to most of the frameworks we used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn a lot and considering we tried using languages and frameworks we never used before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how important time management is. In addition, we learned how to use an API and work with multiple frameworks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shelteroo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have to fix a bunch of stuff. For starters some of our links don't work. In addition, while we used our API to calculate distance, we don't show the actual map.
