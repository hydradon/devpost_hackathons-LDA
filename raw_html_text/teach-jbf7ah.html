                    A missed school day is a lost opportunity for students to learn. In this time and day nothing is more important than education. Absences usually lead to low grades which eventually lead to a student losing interest in class. So what steps should we take to avoid this? 
To solve problems we often go to the roots of it. And that is exactly what our team did. We created TEACH to help absent students catch up with their work!
Teach allows students to keep track of their work, connect with teachers and students live, submit their assignments, and participate in class discussions. 
It is time to digitize education and TEACH is the first step towards reaching our goal:
Education For Everyone Everywhere
