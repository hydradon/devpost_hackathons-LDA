                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the need to support and protect women in public spaces. In some areas around the world, 79% of women feel unsafe walking around their community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app will allow women to communicate and help each other navigate safely throughout their communities by being able to anonymously self-report crime incidents in the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of now, our prototype is a visual demo that provides how each screen will look and what functions they will provide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is all our first time attending a Hackathon which made it challenging to create a product in a short amount of time.
Because none of us have the coding skills to create an app, we were only able to visually create a demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy with our results. We were able to create a product in under 36 hours that can potentially help millions of women around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I experienced how much thought goes into developing a product and making it accessible to everyone.

                    What's next for Safespace:Mobile justice platform for violence against women
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to create a functional prototype for the app.
