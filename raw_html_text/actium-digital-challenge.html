                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We followed the guidelines shown in the website of that chapter
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tries to calculate the salami slicing with a simple algorithm
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with a generic formula to calculate the sum of all the bills and then with the discount try to calculate the salami slicing
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actium Digital Challenge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon and we have reached the final stage, more than we had expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How does a CTF work and its procedure to solve it. We also learn how to find text hidden on images and audio tracks.
