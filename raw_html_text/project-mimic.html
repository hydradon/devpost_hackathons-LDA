                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create and teach things in VR with the possibility of seeing outcomes in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user is able to build objects using primitive shapes such as squares and cylinders. The example we have provided is the satellite Sputnik and the user gets to combine shapes to make it. On the side, you are able to see a enlarged version of it for clarity and enjoyment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity game engine and C# with the HTC Vive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to rotate objects and calculate the math to build objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was done mainly through scripts so I felt I learned a lot personally on how to do C#. I had mainly only done 3D modeling and had limited experience actually developing with the HTC Vive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to combine C# scripts to make a scene in the HTC Vive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Mimic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of things we like to implement more, like seeing data in the objects projected in the giant area and actually implement real time movement and modeling.
