                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal was to make bus-stop advertisements more interactive and memorable and perhaps get people interested in local legislature that affects them directly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It combines a bus stop touchscreen with simple poll functionality. We selected the &ldquo;choose one&rdquo; format for it&rsquo;s simplicity and low threshold for interaction, it&rsquo;s also easy to implement and for companies to adapt their advertisements to.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into this competition we had very little technical knowledge, we got a free domain name and web hosting and together with stackoverflow puzzled together this project. We used Pixlr.com/editor to make our site.
