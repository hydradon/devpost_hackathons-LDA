                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most people must have such an experience, when you are playing games or do some personal things in office, you absolutely didn&rsquo;t recognize you boss is just behind you. Oops! Been caught!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When your boss is passing by  and look at your computer, the camera can recognize your boss&rsquo;s face and pop up a working page. So the boss will not find that your are doing something that are unrelated to the work. It can also be used at home to prevent your parents peeping your computer.
