                    When you land in Fiji and are first welcomed with the greeting "Bula!" (pronounced boo-lah!), you will certainly feel you have arrived somewhere special. The literal meaning of this word is
                    <strong>
                        Life
                    </strong>
                    , and Boolah aims to do exactly that,
                    <strong>
                        "Say Hello to the Life of Travel"

                    Boolah does all the

                        travel planning for you

Reports suggest that as much as 85% of today's vibrant young travel community never look for activities before they arrive at a place. What if we could simplify their itinerary after they arrive at a place? So in place of travelers browsing through a not-so-short list of recommendations and reviews to create their own itinerary, Boolah
                    <strong>
                        builds the itinerary
                    </strong>

                <p>
                    Open Boolah and you see a page to explore 8 cities we've hand picked for you. Each city has several points of interests with an image and description. The user can
                    <strong>
                        swipe left or right
                    </strong>
                    the point. Just swipe left if you like the place or wish to pass the same, right if you don't. It's as simple as that, and unlike those numerous dating apps, our places don't swipe right on you, you can always visit every place that you've swiped left.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Boolah learns your travel interests based on your selections and we build the itinerary based exactly on your choice styles. Say you prefer natural parks over skyscrapers, we make sure you get to see Central Park or the Hudson river in NYC before we take you to the towering skyscrapers. The more you swipe, the better we get to understand your favorites and the better we build your itinerary. Every point of interest that you've liked gets saved to your liked places list in

                    Generating a interest based itinerary was the most complicated part of the app as it involved considering several factors like user interests , distance to the place, managing times and preferences to suggest restaurants.
