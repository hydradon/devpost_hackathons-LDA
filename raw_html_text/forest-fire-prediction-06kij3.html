                    We knew that wildfires were a big problem in the last couple of years in California, and we wanted to try and find a way to limit the fires from spreading. Our project predicts the amount of land the next wildfire burns, which can help limit the spread and also help people evacuate quicker. We used a data set from kaggle.com, and normalized it to input it into an AdaBoost model. We used gridsearch to improve upon the hyperparameters to select the best model. Some challenges we ran into were the data set had words instead of numbers, so we had to tokenize the words to make the dataset a compatible model. Another challenge was that the dataset was pretty small so it was harder to create an accurate model. We persevered through these challenges, and created a reasonably accurate model, and we are proud of that. We learned many new machine learning techniques, and also learned how to manipulate the dataset. Next time, we could make a larger dataset to make the model more accurate, and we could tune the hyperparameters better to make the project work better on a grander scale. We could expand this into and app or a website, which could go public and help firefighters.
