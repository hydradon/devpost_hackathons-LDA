                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this was when I raced my friend john in a typing race during the hackathon. We saw that we typed differently and decided to analyze typing based on that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You train the model by typing in your password a few times. When you go to type it in again it will recognize that you are the owner of that password. If someone else types in your password it will know that the true owner isn't typing in the password
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a restful api through express to expose a training and login endpoint that would hosted the logic for this app

                    Challenges we ran into

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    The overall idea and approaches we took. We dabbled with machine learning only to find out it wasn't necessary.
