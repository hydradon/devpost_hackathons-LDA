                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most Americans are stressed about their financial situation. Some studies have found that this stress increases people's chances of developing chronic illness. We asked - what if Citi could help?

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doceo scans financial and non financial data (with user permission), and looks for all the pattern changes in user's history, which may indicate a life event. Doceo team then engages the user to validate that a life event has occurred, and explores options to reduce financial stress. If no financial options can be supported, Doceo team helps users setup a fundraising page (such as GoFundMe) with a "verified by Citi" seal of approval.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed a framework for data correlation in R and designed a workflow for product design.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have programming support, since our team's expertise is in business workflow design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork. We're really proud of what our team has been able to accomplish in a relatively short period of time.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Customer trust is everything in a service business. A bank can lose millions of dollars and regain the money back. However, once trust with the customer is lost, it will be very difficult for the bank to gain it back .

                    What's next for Citi Doceo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will hire a software developer to complete the software, make a use case and create a beta version of Doceo.
