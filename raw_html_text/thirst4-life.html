                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's the first thing you think about when hearing someone you just met is from Romania?
Most certainly, the most common answers are Dracula, Hagi, Nadia! (and maybe Vadim?)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even so, even if most of them know that Dracula is from Transylvania, not all of them know that Transylvania is in Romania.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That&rsquo;s why we decided to make a website for those who are crazy about the myths and legends of count Dracula.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an spoof product website on which we sell one single thing: a small bottle of immortality potion made from the water that springs underneath the Castle of Dracula.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clearly, this product doesn&rsquo;t exist, and if someone wants to buy it, they will arrive on a funny page where we invite them to visit Romania themselves, so they could see the castle of Dracula in reality!
