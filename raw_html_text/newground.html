                    During a 2019 Hackathon on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the founders of NewGround decided that corporate expansion shouldn't be so difficult. NewGround is a startup consulting firm that specializes in locating and harvesting banking data of over  74,000 Capital One banking clients throughout all 50 U.S. states.

                    While it was an amazing experience, we had our fair share of difficulties over the weekend. Coming into the weekend, all of our team members had either written a few lines of JavaScript code or none at all, and a substantial portion of NewGround was built on JavaScript. We had to adapt and embrace failure in order to tackle a tough project in an unfamiliar language. We also misread the API documentation and spent time creating thousands of unnecessary data points. We had difficulty parsing the JSON data with express.js, so we had to switch to Python Flask. Because we switched to Python, we had to scrap our Next.js front-end, therefore we were not able to implement all of the functions we wanted to in the given time frame.

                    Our target clientele are businesses looking to expand to new locations and would like access to
data about the citizens of different potential areas. Based on an extensive framework of geolocation and intensive analytics, NewGround evaluates financial data from banking customers across all 50 US states so businesses can make informed, data-based decisions. With our technology, our partners are able to 
screen the 74,000 banking clients in our database based on factors such as disposable income and
zip code.

                    In the era of ecommerce and online shopping, businesses that aim to expand to new physical locations
must rely on intensive research and analysis before breaking new ground. Navigating a new location can
be difficult, don't do it alone. Reach new spaces. Reach new goals. Reach new ground.
