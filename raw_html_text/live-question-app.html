                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To actually make students understand what they learn in lecture so that they understand the application of the content and encourage students to talk to each-other in large lecture halls. I realized a lot of people just refrain from asking questions and thereby mug up all the information.Also, a lot of people do not even ask questions o their fellow classmates thinking they will be judged upon by their question's level of difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows to ask questions in a visually appealing way during the lecture. The professor can chose to answer the question during the lecture or after the lecture. The answer will reach the students personal account so that he can access it whenever he wants. If the question has already been answered, the professor can require the student to talk to the student who answered that question. Each student is linked to his/her seat number in the lecture hall when he signs up on the app/web. So, the professor can map the seats which asked the same question to encourage students to talk and work together.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was linking each chair with the number the user signed up with. Also, storing the questions and answers to the questions asked in personal accounts made in database.
