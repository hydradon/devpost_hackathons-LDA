                <p>
                    With capabilities of smart poles, a new set of applications need to be built to provide better services and business opportunities for smart cities.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to limited time and resources, we couldn't finish everything we want to build.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with the idea and got the very basic prototype up &amp; running in a very limited time frame. All the design is also done by us developers, which is something we don't usually do on the daily basis :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart poles open up many new opportunities for the smart cities. By participating in the hackathon, we also learned about the new horizon that 5G and the upcoming 4th industrial revolution are going to provide to our lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smart Poles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll continue finalize our ideas and applications to hopefully make them come true one day.
