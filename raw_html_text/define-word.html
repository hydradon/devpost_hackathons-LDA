                    This is a Amazon Alexa Skills that will help you to get the meaning of new words. You can ask questions like
                    <code>
                        Tell me the meaning of Love
                    </code>
                    or
                    <code>

                <p>
                    I have never build this type of application before so I have followed links from the resources tab and the
                    <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit" rel="nofollow">
                        Amazon Alexa documentation
                    </a>
                    . I have used python 2.7 to build this skill and the backend is hosted on AWS Lambda. I have also used BeautifulSoup Python Library to dynamically get the meaning from the web pages.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    I have faced many issues while building this entire project.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        I have learnt how to use Amazon AWS to host the Amazon Skills Kit backend.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I have learnt about scrapping page using BeautifulSoap.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I have changed the maximum execution time to 10 seconds so that the content is retrieved properly. But I have to improve it more so that it becomes more responsive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        5. I have to create the deployment package for this project as it uses BeautifulSoup that is not by default included in AWS Lambda.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    While there are other issues also but with awesome Amazon Alexa and Amazon AWS documentation these problems can be easily solved by anyone.
