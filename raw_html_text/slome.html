                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our own struggles to find the perfect off-campus housing, so we wanted to create a tool to ease this problem and help determine the most desired living location based on our preferences, such as location and criminal activity in the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We compiled commute data, real-time police reports, and more from several sources to provide prospective tenants with unbiased, intuitive data that enables them to compare many properties with ease and flexibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the frontend using React and Bootstrap, and the backend using Node.js and Express. Both were deployed to Google App Engine.
Using simple and easy-to-navigate user interface, we developed a webpage that utilizes Google Maps API and collects a database of real-time police reports. In the given 24 hours, we managed to split up the work efficiently and created a working and aesthetically-pleasing product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next for SLOme
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add more features to our web app such as estimating distances to your friends&rsquo; locations and having a financial budgeting aspect to calculate rent and help college students be more financially conscious when making housing decisions.
