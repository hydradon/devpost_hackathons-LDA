                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I took a bee keeping class for fun at UCR. In my studies I came across the zombie fly and wondered if we can keep track of honey bees that are infected.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracks bees that go in and out of the hive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the program using computer vision.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A big challenge I ran into is counting the bees because of the shadows, colors, and the time of day.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to count some of the bees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After working with computer vision I learned  that a better approach to this would be to use machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bee Tracking
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to work on this project again using machine learning. The first thing I want to do is keep track of the bees from morning until the evening. For night time I want to use heat sensing to keep track of the bees that could possibly be leaving at night. I want to further extend this project by detecting enemy's that want to enter the hive such as wasps, beetles, and moths.
