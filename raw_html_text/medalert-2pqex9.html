                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from the fact that many times elderly people will take readings for their health and might have readings that indicate a possible medical emergency, but they might not know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a medical machine learning python module, we created a web app that allows people to enter their medical data and contact the appropriate services if there are signs of an emergency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by using a medical machine learning module call MedicareAI and then used flask and sqlite3 to create a website and store information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, the flask would not function on our google console server
We had to get the components to communicate properly (front-end HTML, back-end python using MedicareAI for machine learning, python using flask connecting them, and SQL storing the data). We were also unable to get the Dragonboard to work properly with the temperature sensor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of getting the machine learning and the flask MySQL integration working. We also really like the UI that we used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use flask, sqlite3, and how to integrate the websites together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MedAlert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal is to develop this into a actual product and have this deployed for actual patients with legitimate data.
