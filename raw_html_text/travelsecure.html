                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone knows about the difficulties being in a flight delay/cancellation. Don't you hate it when airline companies take forever to refund you the money? Well, through TravelSecure, the customers get a unique ID that once typed into our system, will refund the money in a matter of minutes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TravelSecure is an insurance company that customers pay a small fee for every month. In case, the customers experience a flight cancellation, the money will be refunded very quickly. For delays, there's only a portion of the money that is transferred.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of now, we don't have a full working model but we used Java to build a hard coded program that has 5 customers that are already in a system. A customer has a name, ID, their flight confirmation number, and flight number along with their ETH balance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was that Hedera and MetaMask does not link or there's no link for it yet as the people from Hedera are still trying to work on it. So what we have now is a rough idea of what we want to build.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a rough sketch of how the app for the program would work which took us a while but it was worth it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how ethereum works and more about the MetaMask software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TravelSecure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly get Hedera and Metamask to link up and get a working program.
