                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try some hardware we have not tried before and decided to create a simple game using the Leap Motion device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You progress through the game by making specific gestures at the Leap Motion as indicated by the game's text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded it in C++ and used the Leap Motion to integrate gestures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Leap Motion is very sensitive and mixes up gestures often. We could not use the same gestures two times in a row because it would jump the game forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to integrate new hardware in classic text-based RPG as well as challenge ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use and program with the Leap Motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cavernous
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really enjoyed creating a text-based RPG and would like to add more gestures to make a more realistic game. We want to make the gestures more intuitive based on the actions.
