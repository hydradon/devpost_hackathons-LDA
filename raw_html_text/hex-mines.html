                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mineswpeer has been an adiction for me. I always play when I conmute and don't have a book. I wondered how the difficult the puzzle would be on other grids. I started with a hexagonal grid because it was the most appealing to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You play minesweeper on a hexagonal grid. It is a game where some cells have mines. The
                    <strong>
                        goal
                    </strong>
                    is to click and reveal all clean cells without mines. The first cell clicked is always clean and starts a timer. A revealed cells indicates the number mines on adyacent cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can choose the size of the grid and the number of mines, which may be between 1 mines and the total number of mines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML and Javascript, I used Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for the geometric figures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Issues generating the hexagonal-cells, specially trying to adjust their size so the overall board would remain the same. 
I did this whole project on my own. I arrived late at the Hackathon. This is also my first submission on a MLH hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had little knowledge of Javascript and nothing of SVG, now I am more confident.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript, styles, troubleshouting.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Make a leaderboard.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Store data of the game on an external variable for better performance and to avoid cheaters. Right now I am using the tags of each object, which also makes it easy for people to cheat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Refine the use of SVG.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use existing hexagonal grid for other games. I would like to make a Langton ant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use other grids (triangular, etc...).
