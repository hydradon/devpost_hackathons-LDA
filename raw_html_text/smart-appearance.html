                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have seen people working around the hours and this busy schedule they only happen to have choice of choosing their apparels over the internet, but the drawback is, the size of their favorite product might not fit them. 
We are here with a solution, we call it &ldquo;Smart Apparels&rdquo;, having so less time from their busy schedule, they can use their hand gesture to change between products from their hats to their shoes; they can use this project while shopping and save a lot of time without actually changing dresses. 
We came up with this idea after looking at the real-time issues of malls, online shopping  and performing some surveys, technology that we propose to use is based on SPARK AR and simple camera and some specific scripts. 
Bringing this idea we intend to save the users/ customers time, as being consumers we know how precious time for customer is.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The SPARK A.R. based Smart Apparel used in many ways, like personal decor, Clothing sector etc. We thought about this project looking at the today&rsquo;s shopping and consumers&rsquo; environment. We thought we can improve the condition by this project.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SPARK AR based Smart  app with features of Mirror brings the complete set of Apparels in customer engagement and live interaction possible . A primary goal  and motive of using  SPARK AR based Smart Mirror is to create a system which can display clothing brands solutions on mirror and use to save the time of customers.The app simply brings confidence of look and feel for clothing and footwear products.
