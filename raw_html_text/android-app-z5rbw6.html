                    I was thinking about people who are elderly and could really use an app that keeps track of their medications. luckily this app you can barcode or qrcode scan or take an image. Problem that's still runs within the app is being unable to have the user of the app create folders inside the create option. When the person is to scan or take an image of a medication they should be able to have the option for whose file that medicine belongs into. The good things is the Qrcode and barcode scan along with image options all work. The only things that I need to work on is being able to create proper folders and being able to view the folders for information of whose medications belongs to whom.
