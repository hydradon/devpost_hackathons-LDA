                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In my house, my parents have taken care of my grandparents after my grandfather had a stroke. Neither of my grandparents can drive anymore, but stroke patients are often unaware of their limitations and reach for the keys anyway.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With StarKey, you can keep your keys in the hands of only the drivers in the house. It acts as a normal key rack when a driver is in range and locks access to the keys when no drivers are around to give you peace of mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Kinoma Create to pair with drivers' phones via Bluetooth when in range. This actuates the servos on the key rack to unlock access to the keys. We designed AutoDesk Fusion 360 to design our laser-cut hardware pieces. After a lot of filing and elbow grease, we got our StarKey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever used Kinoma hardware, AutoDesk Fusion 360, or had made a Bluetooth-enabled application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are certainly proud of all we learned about the above tools. We're also very proud of the functionality and aesthetic of StarKey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make Kinoma Create applications, how to use AutoDesk Fusion 360, how to make a Bluetooth-enabled app, and how to use pulse width modulation on servos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StarKey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to improve the housing to be more robust. We'd also like to see how my parents would use it in their house and add functionality based on their user feedback.
