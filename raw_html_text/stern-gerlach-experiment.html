                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help students understand challenging quantum physics experiments and help them appreciate the beauty of nature. We also wanted to help researchers to do their research. Many times funding is difficult to get and so researchers are not able to get access to expensive  tools that they need to do their research. By creating simulators like this one we are able allow researchers and students to do do experiments that normally would cost a fortune
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project simulates the  Stern Gerlach Experiment by using a host of tools to calculate and visualize the quantum effect of spin and indeed this experiment first done in 1922 was decisive in convincing scientists of the reality of spin (angular momentum quantization) .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python as well as several of python's science libraries like numpy, scipy and matplotlib in order to build a physics engine. We then combined this with a HTML and javascript front end to provide visualizations and an user interface of this experiment. Our front end used three.js to help build 3D models of the simulation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the physics engine the math is complicated because it is non-linear. It is a non-linear physics system and requires the deep understanding of differential and multivariable calculus. The front end required a library that we have never used before. however we persisted to learn over night and eventually made a worthwhile front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a comprehensive visualization and clear UI. We were also able to complete the physics system which was so complicated to us in the beginning. Making a physics simulation is new to us, and being able to complete it and potentially benefit to other struggling students make us proud!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For Jiafeng, as a beginner, I learned how to use git, bottle, a chain of nested functions, and most importantly, how to cooperate with team in doing project. For Carleton, I learned quantum physics and was able make a physics simulation which I never have experienced before. Both of us gained experience in working in a stressful and time sensitive environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stern Gerlach Experiment Simulation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This simulation now can only  be applied to certain elements. In the future, we want it to be applicable to all elements in the periodic table, and potentially never before seen physics phenomenons.
