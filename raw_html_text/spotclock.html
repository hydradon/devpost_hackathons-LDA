                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SpotClock is and alarm clock that runs on the web. It allows user to schedule the time to wake-up. However, this dynamic alarm clock checks traffic and the weather and reschedules the alarm time according to traffic and weather delays.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being web-based, we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as jQuery and Node.js. For responsiveness we incorporated Bootstrap 4. We utilized Google Map's API and a weather API to rather real-time data on traffic and weather, respectively. The web app is currently hosted on Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing the API's proved to be difficult and time-consuming. We searched a handful of them, but many were too complex or had some inconvenience (having a premium account). One of these is Spotify. We also had three members since one of them had to leave due to an emergency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being complete strangers we got along really well. The early difficulty and slow start could have easily caused us to give up, but we encouraged each other and saw the end goal. Even though things didn't go as planned, we are proud of the accomplishments we have made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest things we have learned is incorporating API's into our project. We brushed up on web technology languages, and learned about the server-side of websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SpotClock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to include the Spotify API to the alarm functionality. Additional features like Alexa compatibility and machine learning are possible goals.
