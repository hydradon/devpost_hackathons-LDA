                    Inspiration- We wanted to make a fun but challenging game based on traditional 2D-platformers
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does- You control the main character "Djinn" and play through the Incendium, avoiding obstacles and collecting coins to reach the goal
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it - We used the Unity game engine, Clip Studio Paint/Adobe Photoshop CS6 (for the art and sprites), and Cockos Reaper/Sonic Pi (For music and sound design)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into - Lack of skill in C# (first time users), animating multiple sets of frames, underestimating the scale of the game (we had to cut down from 3 levels to one level because of time)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - Creating a full functioning character with proper mechanics, quality of animation, and main theme/sound fx
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned - Reliance on other teammates, pay attention to level scoping/ communication about level design
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for Incendium: Unity Engine Videogame : Expand game into multiple levels with a final boss
