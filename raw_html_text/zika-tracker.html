                        In the last year, the instances of cases of the Zika virus have exploded, and unfortunately the demographic that is the worst affected is pregnant women and their unborn children. Zika has been linked to an increase in the rate of the birth defect known as

                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In developing nations with large populations it is quite challenging for governments/medical authorities/non-profit organizations to deploy assistance to populations afflicted with the Zika virus. There

                        is
                    </del>
                    was also a lack of a database which holds information regarding occurences of the disease. OpenTrckr's motivation is to resolve this problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Opentrckr provides live access to data regarding user reported instances of the disease, stagnant water bodies and location of medical camps - crucial information to both victims and organizations alike.

                    OpenTrckr makes use of Google Maps' API to render a user's current coordinates. If current coordinates are not correct (which is unlikely), the user is allowed to place a crosshair wherever they'd like. Checks have been installed to make sure that a user
                    <em>
                        cannot
                    </em>
                    add more than one tag in a 24 hour period in a 2 mile radius. This check was installed to make sure that a user cannot spam the app with false tags (making our data more authentic).

                    OpenTrckr demonstrates its ultimate usefulness with its ability to alert agencies that need to reach out to areas in need of help, but the lack of staff and comprehensive data on Zika victims prevents them from efficiently reaching victims on time. Geo-tags are present on the map in clusters, and this makes rendering a single set of coordinates (to alert an agency with) problematic. An example can of a cluster is demonstrated below.
