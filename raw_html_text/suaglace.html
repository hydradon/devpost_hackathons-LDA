                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our principal inspiration was trying to solve a common problem seen when we were kids: organizing outside hockey matches on community ice rinks with your friends or even strangers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app, which is deployed both on mobile and the web, allows you to visually see all the outside community ice rinks. From the map, you can access multiple information about a specific rice rink. These include the name of the rink, its current condition, when it was last updated as well as the players currently playing on the ice rink.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the UI, we used Ionic which allowed us to be flexible by deploying our application both on mobile (Android and IOS) and the Web. All of our back end containing the ice rinks information and the current players for example, is done with a C# server accessible via a REST API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was supposed, at first, to integrate some of Genetec SDK's features like access control and user management to have a strong foundation for our application. After a couple of hours, we finally gave up when we had trouble with some of the SDK's DLLs. We then changed our gameplan and came up with a much simpler design all made by us while still retaining usability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have a working communication between our mobile (Android as well as IOS) and our .NET Server through a REST API because it initially did not work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us learned more about REST APIs, others learned a new framework, Ionic, and most importantly, we all learned to never give up because it looked without hope at some moment and we still ended up with a working mobile and web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SuaGlace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of exciting features like NFC compatibility for gaining ice rinks access, matchmaking, rosters and much more. We look forward to having our application be integrated in many more cities to help every hockey lover find a team to enjoy the sport.
