                <p>
                    Our inspiration to build
                    <strong>
                        DSI FVRT
                    </strong>
                    (pronounced - favorite) has been to bring the adventure and fun of extreme sports indoors, and to make it part of your daily workout or fitness regime.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does :
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The DSI FVRT &ndash; Fitness Virtual Reality Trainer is a fully immersive extreme fitness training system. It leverages recent advancements in VR Headsets, in this case the Oculus Rift, and IoT sensors. It provides the user a safe and convenient alternative for extreme fitness.  FVRT integrates with the Cerner FHiR (pronounced &ldquo;Fire&rdquo;) Health API to track users&rsquo; training progress and provides an easy to use web portal for tracking training progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building DSI FVRT involved a number of elements to be built and integrated together. The first task was to convert a mountain bike into a stationary machine. We built a bike pedestal to mount the bike. The bike was hooked up with electronic circuitry and software programs were written to capture the bike movements such as pedal rotations, handle movement etc. A virtual reality environment was built that provided the landscape to ride the bike. Cerner  FHiR API were integrated into the system for health monitoring. These reading are available to the user through a web portal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into :
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major hurdles we ran into was higher processing power. To accomplish lifelike mountain biking experience to the user a 3D virtual landscape is rendered in real time, biking movements like pedal rotations, handle movements etc are all captured and processed in real time. All this involves high amount of graphical and computational processing. The standard out of the box laptops didn't provide the best real time experience we hoped for.  To overcome this challenge we built a light weight landscape to optimize the virtual reality experience for the prototype. For the final product with the right computational power we can further enhance the DSI FVRT experience for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of :
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the 20 hour hackathon we had a long list of things to be completed. Each team member had a piece of the puzzle and bringing these pieces together was the key for the final presentation.  We as a team are very proud of completing all the pieces and leaving the audience dumbfounded with the final demonstration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A great idea and fantastic team to execute it can go a long way in achieving a product prototype even when you have only 20 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DSI FVRT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DSI FVRT prototype is ready. We would like to complete the Oculus Rift integration, optimize the performance,  design and test it on various landscapes and capture health monitoring. We would like to further enhance the product for other extreme sports like snowboarding, surfing etc.
