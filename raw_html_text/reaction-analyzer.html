                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A company is nothing without advertisement, we wanted to make a tool that allowed a company to analyze and see the tiny micro-expressions that the human eye can easily miss, to see how the public may react to a advertising campaign
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses a python script to write an HTML page that displays a given video advertisement, (for our purposes, we loaded it with random funny commercials) and activates the computer webcam to record reactions using Microsofts Azure Emotion Tracker to give a graphical output as to how the subject reacted
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python, Javascript, and HTML5
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting python and javascript to communicate with each other
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a solid idea and plan formed for a product that we can continue to evolve and develop well after the competition ends
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Reaction Analyzer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Side-by-side analysis for companies to see when and where reactions occur and implementing a fully functional text analyzer to process emotions from a typed response to advertisement
