                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of our dormmates had to create four year plans for their advising appointments but were always lost or frustrated. Sometimes the requirements were unclear, other times people just didn't know when to start. We figured we could make something that could be helpful for them and many others.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lays out all 4 years, showing you when you should take major classes, and helps you figure out what gen ed requirements you can get
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it HTML/CSS/JS. The frontend uses Materialize to create a clean, modern interface. jQuery is used to make a dynamic UI that reacts to user input and changing data. We pull some data(class names and descriptions) from umd.io, but we had to build a lot of our dataset ourselves. With enough time and processing, some of that data could be taken from umd.io as well. All the code to create a schedule based on major requirements is written in Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the team had not done a real-world project before and were new to Javascipt and git. In the end, though, this was not much of a problem, as they learned quickly. They all got inspired by working on this and want to do even more projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked really well together, even though most of the team had not coded as a team before. We made a really nice-looking UI, and the core functionality of the app is working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone in the team learned a lot, mostly about collaboration. It took a bit of getting used to, but we were able to work together really well, and everyone learned a lot of technical skills as well as collaborative skills
