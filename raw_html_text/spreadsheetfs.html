                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When using Google Drive, I noticed that any Google Docs/Sheets you store don't count towards your 15GB free storage limit. Realizing this technically allowed me to store an unlimited amount of data for free, I decided to take advantage of this fact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    spreadsheetfs is a FUSE virtual filesystem that stores file data in a Google Sheet as base64 encoded binary data. File contents are stored in the A column, file names in the B column, and a variety of metadata in other cells. It supports most filesystem operations (read/write/open/unlink/truncate), however currently does not support subdirectories or symbolic links.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As stated above, since data stored in Google Sheets doesn't count towards your usage limit on Google Drive, spreadsheetfs allows you to get a unlimited (albeit slow) amount of free cloud storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially I planned to implement spreadsheetfs using libfuse's C API, but quickly realized finishing the project in 24 hours without using a higher level language wasn't going to be possible. Because of this, I switched to
                    <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/python-fuse" rel="nofollow">
                        libfuse's Python bindings
                    </a>
                    . Communication with the Google sheets API is done through
                    <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client" rel="nofollow">
                        Google's Python API client
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Python bindings for FUSE aren't heavily documented, which necessitated quite a bit of trial and error. Problems were also run into trying to get write access to a Google sheet as I didn't realize you needed to authenticate with OAuth to write to a sheet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time working with FUSE, so I learned a lot about its inner workings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for spreadsheetfs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to add support for subdirectories, and perhaps symbolic links. Additionally, only very basic file metadata is stored and  returned from the
                    <code>
                        stat
                    </code>
                    syscall currently, which could be improved.
