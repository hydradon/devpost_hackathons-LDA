                <p>
                    Hello, and welcome to our project, the Bagel Personality Quiz! Here&rsquo;s some background information on who we are, and why we decided to make this. Our names are Sage, Gen, and Neha, and we&rsquo;re all freshmen at UMD. We met this year in the ACES Program here, and ever since then, we&rsquo;ve grown and strengthened an amazing girl-gang group of friends who all have so much love for computer science and for each other. We came into Technica not quite sure where we&rsquo;d fit in due to our relative lack of experience in coding and the technology world. All we knew was this, we wanted to create something, and something that mattered to us, so we would learn and grow from every mistake, so that we would be able to participate in the unstoppable force that is women in computing, and so we could commemorate our friendship, and how much it matters to us even in such a relatively short period of knowing each other. So we created this, a bagel personality quiz, because bagels are a staple of our morning breakfast runs, and in addition to computer science, we have a passion for reminding people of their strengths and worth, even in a means that might seem as silly as a short quiz. Over the course of this weekend, with every time we exclaimed and hugged after fixing a problem with our code, and every brainstorming session of what people need to hear but aren&rsquo;t told enough, and finally, every genuine smile we saw when someone got the results of this quiz, this project has come to mean more and more to us. We hope we can share that with you today, knowing that this is just the beginning of our journey as women in tech, and that we have the power to make a positive impact on other people&rsquo;s lives in both the biggest and the smallest of ways :)

                <p>
                    The Bagel Personality Quiz is a quick quiz that will reveal which bagel aligns with someone's personality, character, and strengths.

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to learn how to make a GUI in Java so we used jswing and awt.

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out how to make the next question appear on the screen in response to a user choosing an answer. We also had to figure out how to store the answers and points in arrays.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The personality quiz seems to be very accurate! Many users have said that the description of the results actually does match their personality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create jframes, jlabels, etc. We also learned how to extend a method, import images into a GUI, override a method, and use loops for new purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bagel Personality Quiz:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make the GUI prettier and add more questions to make a more detailed quiz.
