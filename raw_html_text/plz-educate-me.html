                    We were sitting around coming up with so many complicated ideas that could not be accomplished within the time frame. When we conversed with other teams, we realized that they too had many problems that required constant help from mentors. This got us thinking about how many individuals face this same problem in college (when students are up at 2 or 3 AM trying to finish an assignment that is due at 8AM), when a person is absolutely stuck and needs help asap. One solution would be to email a professor, but many times, they would not respond until the teacher for your class is completely free, which in most cases, would be way too late. We realized that we needed a unilateral way to unite a student with ANY potential resources that could help them complete their task as soon as possible. This led to the creation of the PANIC button.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project allows students to do a general request for help (like a generalized tutoring service) and a specialized PANIC function which sends a generalized request that allows a student to get matched up to ANY teacher (all of whom receive a notification when the panic button is selected) within the specified subject. This hack reduces the average time for a response, from hours, to minutes, due to the high number of teachers on college campuses. helping students learn and grow faster than ever, while also providing opportunities for professors to earn bonuses and gain even more educational notoriety throughout the college.

                <p>
                    we created a new domain, then used google cloud to create a mySQL database, then linked it to our server by using PHP.

                    Domain setup errors, database creation/ display errors, and MULTIPLE connection errors

                <p>
                    We learned how to successfully use google MySQL and connect it to a domain, while also implementing multiple PHP files to join the two.

                    PHP does not play well with a new domain and google

                <p>
                    We plan to work out the bugs and eventually create a seamless webapp that can be used quickly and efficiently. The next step is to implement this into a college and gain a large user base so we can accurately portray the time saving, knowledge sharing masterpiece, and eventually spread this idea out to as many colleges as possible to make a positive impact on the world.
