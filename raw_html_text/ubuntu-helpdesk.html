                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Help new Ubuntu users to get familiar with the environment with a chatbot
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    Ubuntu Helpdesk is a virtual chatbot assistant that can answer users' question about the Ubuntu system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We trained the chatbot using a dialogue corpus of dialogues related to Ubuntu technical support and deployed it to Heroku. 
We used the Seq2seq RNN model from tensorflow for training the bot and the Compute Engine on the Google Cloud Platform to facilitate the training process. Finally, we made the interface for the chatbot on a Flask app and deployed it to Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were too much slang in the corpus, which caused our bot to use 'lol', 'thanks', and emojis very often.
We faced a lot of technical errors while setting up the compute engine and the heroku app.
It was our first time creating a chatbot purely by training from corpus data, so we had to learn a lot.
We couldn't use GPU for training the model, so trainings were extremely slow and was with limited data, causing the results to be not as ideal.
                </p>

                    More training time and data so that the chatbot can perform better
