                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While doing laundry, I was curious what the washing symbols really meant but couldnt find a simple and intuitive mobile resource to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application simply takes an image of the washing tag and returns information regarding the different symbols
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized android studio to develop the main application and used the google cloud platform api's to use its machine learning capabilities to determine the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we ran into was communicating between the API and android studio. This was due to the fact that the API that we wanted to use was only released about a month ago and the documentation has not been complete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn a lot with regards to the google cloud platform and its integration with both android and web applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basic concepts behind machine learning and how it is possible to integrate the google cloud platform to mobile applications.

                    What's next for Laundrpal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve the integration between the application and the API and possibly try utilizing technologies like Tensorflow to better teach and analyze the symbols.
