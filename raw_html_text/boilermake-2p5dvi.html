                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something that would really help people, and while brainstorming, we thought about health, which lead to the idea of first aid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It acts as an instant guide to First Aid, helping users identify injuries and telling them the steps to perform first aid. It was also planned to identify the injury based on camera photos using a trained AI from Google's AutoML Cloud Vision kit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flutter to build the app, and Google Cloud Vision to train the AI. We also used Google Firebase to host a function that requests could be sent to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the Trained AI with the Flutter App was a huge challenge. We explored options in over four programming languages without any luck. Regardless, we were able to over come the challenges we all faced as newbies to Flutter and Google Cloud. We're also proud of the extra work we all contributed this time to ensure that the UI's we created were designed well and beautiful
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google's AutoML API
Creating an Android App using flutter

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot. That flutter's really easy to learn but very tough to master, that you shouldn't stay up late cause your brain gets fried, and that planning ahead matters.
                </p>

                    What's next for AidFirst
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the app with a Firebase Function to identify injuries. Also map integration to show nearest hospitals and ambulances.
