                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The world is a colorful place, so why aren't our notifications? Begin to associate your friends and family with a LED color!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a text message is sent to your phone the OS listens and records the phone number and uses that input to generate a custom LED color and pushed the notification.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My biggest challenge was working with cyanogen. Its a huge amount of code to sort through and is difficult to understand how it fits together. There was also no organic way to implement this code it required a creative solution.
