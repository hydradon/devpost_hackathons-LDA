                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following a personal request to build a similar product for a local hospital I realised how important such methods are and asked Vanessa to join in building a business that could solve and help overcome such issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We make bespoke apps that contain Business Continuity Planss for companies to make them easier to use and more effective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lacking the resources to develop for iOS, how to distribute apps with sensitive information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have already made the app for one hospital and have been asked to develop an app for a mental health clinic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is how I first learned how to make apps.
                </p>
