                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to take virtual-reality gaming to the next level. After playing with both the Oculus and Leap motion, we realized how powerful these tools really were, and decided to make a twist on a simple shooter game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Your friends are trying to tag you. You want to avoid being tagged, but it has grown dark since you've begun playing, and they seem to be acting strangely. Equipped with a weak flashlight, an AK-47, and the beats of your favorite jam, you must vanquish your taggers or face the consequences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all relatively inexperienced at hackathons, and none of us had any experience with the Leap motion, Oculus, or Unity game engine. Therefore we had some learning to do, and small forgotten details often led to larger problems in the project.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We pulled off a working product that looks alright!

                    Don't keep your friends too close.
