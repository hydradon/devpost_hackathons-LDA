                    PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Language barriers make teaching and learning difficult for both refugee girls and the teachers; Teachers and refugees speak different languages, often can't understand each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Context:
Imagine you are a Syrian adolescent refugee girl, living in a camp, with limited or no access to the internet. You&rsquo;re often being forced to move country more than once. You&rsquo;re facing tremendous challenges in completing your education, but you have an enormous potential and desire to learn. How can you learn new things while you are on the go, and one of your biggest barriers is not being able to understand the language that is spoken to you?
                </p>
                <p>
                    SOLUTION OVERVIEW: 
Bridge TheGap AR opens a new world of learning for refugee girls. We created a collaborative augmented reality learning and teaching tool that gives refugee girls control to learn anything while they are on the go. It can translate in any language, and can be used offline, anywhere you are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All you need is a piece of paper with what you want to learn, it can be anatomy if you dream to become a doctor, or even computer science if you dream to become an engineer. You pull up a smartphone, you put it on top the paper, and you can see the translation in your own language! You don&rsquo;t need to know the language of the person who&rsquo;s teaching you. And the teacher doesn&rsquo;t need to know your language. He can speak English, you can speak Syrian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    THE AUDIENCE: 
&bull;&nbsp;Adolescent refugee girls 
&bull;&nbsp;12-19 years old 
&bull;&nbsp;Left their country, living in a camp or often being forced to move country more than once.
&bull;&nbsp;Facing tremendous challenges in completing their education
&bull; Often speak their own native language, and can't understand other languages. 
&bull;&nbsp;Limited or no access to the internet.
&bull; No access to formal education
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHY IS THIS SOLUTION UNIQUE?
                    <br>
                    We believe we are changing the future of adolescent refugee girls. But more than that we invest in the technology that gives them control to learn something and teach it further. We put a tool in their hands that will help them become the changers of tomorrow.

                    HOW WE BUILT IT? 
We used, AReality3D RealityScript, Sketch App, Unity for rapid prototyping a no-Internet required AR app.
