                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional 2D platforms and influence from old-school styles, as well as modern League of Legends as a light template.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can control a character where minions move with you to kill other minions an enemy NPC. The goal is to destroy the enemy base.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Java and ran libgdx as our package to help us properly program a game, as well as using Gimp and Tiled to create visual assets for sprites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Properly coordinating a two-player mode, problems involving struggling with minion loop errors, health, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to fix issues regarding camera and character focus, and created our own grid of how many pixels per block (128) and created a traversable platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe not to make too ambitious goals for a short amount of time. Also learned how to experiment with new ways to interact with libgdx and artistic assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mini League of Legends Experiment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing out the bugs to make the demo more interactive and playable, changing sprites, etc.
