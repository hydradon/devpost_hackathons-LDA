                    We all witnessed the Sandy Hook tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut. 26 dead. 20 children. 6 adult staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We--too recently--saw the horrifying aftermath of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school shooting in Parkland, Florida. 17 dead. 15 high school students. 2 adult staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsequent student interviews and police reports regarding these school shootings all retained a familiar theme:
                    <strong>
                        first responders did not have an accurate location of the shooter inside of the school.
                    </strong>
                    <strong>
                        Students lacked an easily accessible platform to report their suspicion of shooter Nikolas Cruz
                    </strong>
                    , someone they knew as a "potential school shooter" months before the tragedy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This begs the question: could this be prevented? Could the growing student movement--one in which young students are taking charge of their personal safeties in schools--lead to fewer school shootings?

                    Our app seeks to offer students options before and during a potential school shooting. Students can report in confidence suspicious behavior that necessitates the attention of authorities. Students can report directly the whereabouts of a shooter to the authorities within their school using GPS location data, with options detailing the shooter's weapons and physical characteristics. Students are offered opportunities to get to know their state and federal representatives' contact information and stances on gun control. Students have access to active shooter protocol, in the--God forbid--event of a school shooting.

                    In our increasingly technological world, it's time to give students--whether in protests and public engagement, or at the touch of a button--the platform to take charge of their safeties and futures. The touch of a button on an app
                    <em>
                        can
                    </em>
                    make a difference.
