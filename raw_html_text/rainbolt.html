                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A person can join the network as a maker, looking to enter into a bet with someone else (anonymously!). This is accomplished by placing funds on-chain (Cosmos) in an escrow account. An anonymous counterparty will commit to enter in the contract, and voila -- they are now trading!
