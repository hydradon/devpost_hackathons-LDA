                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that there wasn't a skill in Alexa that suited our needs for prioritizing and scheduling out events in our daily life. And so, we decided to fill this gap by building this Alexa Skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                    We used the Alexa SDK for Node.js to develop the Alexa Skill.Then we deployed the app with AWS Lambda and stored the data on DynamoDB.
