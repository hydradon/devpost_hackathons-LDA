                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a mixed background of experience:
-walking with people in recovery (struggling with a variety of addictions)
-directing a documentary to raise awareness of mental health issues following the life of a young suicide victim
-teaching young people who face pressures that are often shown through all of the above
I wanted to create something that would give people an opportunity to find support as opposed to isolation. 
Most people struggling with the above won't take the time to text or email due to shame / guilt, but from research say they are more likely to press a button when in a desperate state
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        can also be used for medical / other
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a simple traffic light interface, the app allows the user to add (via a generated code as with bluetooth) 'allies' who they want in their network. This may be a recovery group, church group, or just friendship or family members. The user can update their status with a click of a button. 
Green - all good
Yellow - struggling
Red - help / sos / messed up (according to need)
The alert is sent to the user's allies instantly to inform them, so they can locate / contact / support - be aware
-the user is seen
