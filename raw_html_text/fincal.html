                    A bunch of broke Undergraduates who got inspired to design an app to help fellow students keep track of their daily, monthly expenses, to help them save in the long run. We are Freshmen with no prior programming experience, and took this Hackathon to challenge ourselves to create an app with maximum functionality and practicality in 24 hours. It was a great experience.
