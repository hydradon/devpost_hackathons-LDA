                    Aisle Five came as an idea from two college students who hate overpaying for milk and eggs. Now we will always get the cheapest prices around. Aisle Five allows you to enter in any common grocery item and see where the cheapest places are to get it. We created Aisle Five by hosting a php server using Laravel to communicate to our web hosted and iOS client. The php server crawls a selection of common grocery stores and builds a list of items and their prices.
As this is our very first server driven web application, our main struggle was understanding the logistics and backbone of how a server communicates with web based and iOS clients. Along with that, configuring a server and getting hosting storage was rather tricky to debug. We are all very proud that we were able to get a live site up and running that has a minimal API running in the background to get information on grocery items. We learned how web servers work, how to write php, utilize the Laravel framework, crawl websites for information, and get/post to our php server.
We hope to continue this project by introducing locational services so the user can be aware of how far they will need to travel to pick up their goods. We'd also like to allow for the ability to add each of the item's you're searching into one giant grocery list. At that point you could compare the total costs for going to different stores for your items. These features would have been nice to be able to achieve during boilermake, but since this was our first web application we were content with what we managed to learn and achieve.
