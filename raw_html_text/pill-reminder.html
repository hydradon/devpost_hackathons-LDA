                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to be apart of another hackathon. I came up with a few great life hack ideas, however, the up cost would be too high to make them. I needed to find something simple yet effective. I eventually came up with an idea that would remind users to take their pills. Alexa already has a reminder functionality but what if it was incorporated into flash briefings. That way if you happen to forget your reminder, at least you can be reminded in a flash briefing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pill Reminder reminds users to take their pills from their flash briefings. This is very useful for people who need to take pills daily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using Storyline. Storyline, has a flash briefing option where  I am able to add a weekly post which will remind users to take their pills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was my first time using Storyline, it got a bit of getting used to the interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite being fully focused on my university final year deadlines, I still wanted to take part in this hackathon one way or another, so I am glad that I managed to submit a skill for the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learnt that there are lots of things to consider when building a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pill Reminder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to continue maintaining Pill Reminder so that it can keep reminder users to take their pills.
