                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind Ruta came from the challenge of coordinating the fastest routes between numerous destinations. These instances include: having to run errands and not knowing where to start, coordinating ride-shares for people from unfamiliar locations, or discovering a new city with only a rough list of popular attractions. We thought it would be helpful to have a platform that could assist with visually understanding the best path.

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website provides a mapped itinerary of the fastest route, with an estimate travel time. Users can input their ideal departure time for a more accurate calculation of their travel time.

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the logos and web UI, then used google maps API to map and display the routes.

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge we tackled was determining what algorithm to use when finding the fastest route between two points but also travel through all other points. This is a variation of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), however, now with a determined start and end point. Another challenge we faced was interfacing with google maps API. We used React for our website, however, documentation for the google-maps-react wrapper was sparse. Other challenges we faced were implementing a dynamic controlled form in React as well as a non-standard font.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We determined a high-level modification to solutions for the traveling salesman problem, implemented a dynamic controlled form in React, used a non-standard font, and came up with some workarounds to compensate for the lack of documentation of the google-maps-react wrapper.

                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to interface with the google maps API and React, how to implement a dynamic controlled form in React, and how to apply TSP to a real-world setting.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps for Ruta are implementing a better algorithm for solving our variation of TSP, as well as finding a better way to interface google maps API with React.
