                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea came from us wanting to better board games such as chess by being able to review moves made and improve on strategy. We developed tic hac toe, as a proof of concept for this idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    tic hac toe uses a camera to read tic tac toe moves. It then predicts the next best move for the player to do in order to win. Along the way tic hac toe gives a summary of the game moves made as well as the recommended best game moves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an IP camera app to render an image of the tic tac toe board and we analysed each box and developed the optimization and prediction function s for it in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The IP camera app we used to take photos of the tic tac toe board often ran into technical issues
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to use code we created to analyze an image and create optimization functions to guide the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, our knowledge regarding computer vision has stepped up. Also, working in a team where everyone is from a different background has definitely helped us learn from each other and have a more wholesome experience in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tick Hack Toe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This concept can be incorporated into other board games as well such as checkers and chess.
