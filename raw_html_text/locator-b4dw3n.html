                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running errands takes much longer than it should and we wanted to create an app to simplify the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the user needs to do is update their shopping list on our app and we will compile a map with the fastest routes to cover their desired stops in one go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Thunkable, we collaborated to create a prototype of our envisioned app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one user is allowed to make edits on Thunkable, so we decided to work on different parts on separate laptops and vocally collaborated to help one another before we integrating our work into the final project.
Our map defaulted on Italy, and we had a little bit of difficulty figuring out how to set the map to the user's current location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were glad to finally figure out how to solve the problem of the user's location through research and watching tutorials. We're also proud of the aesthetic design and simplicity of our app and presentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained valuable teamwork experience as well as design knowledge. In addition, we built on our ability to work under time pressure and improved our logical understanding of code.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have many plans and features we hope to add such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Notification: Users  set a certain mile radius and the app notifies  you once a location  is within that distance (this feature can be disabled as it would be continuously running in the background)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Monetization: Advertisements by local businesses, Paid Premium memberships which are ad-free and offer extra features!
                    </li>
                </ul>
