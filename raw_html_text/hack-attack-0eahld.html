                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After hearing "Hey, you're that guy that made that cool game that one year" from other hackathon people, I figured I should try to make a game aimed at hackathon people that's really cool!
This game is probably most easily explained to programmers, and that's what I'm going to be doing at the demo, so it works out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every level has a "code" half and a "game" half. The code acts as pseudocode for the game, but the game on its own isn't beatable. You have to go back and forth editing the code and playing the game to win. 
Only parts of the code are editable, and in later levels, it's revealed the line between the two halves isn't as clear as first thought!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity and programmed everything in C#
I also made images with Gimp
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i got a cold :(
Also, turns out error checking is hard. If the player is trying to break the game, they pretty much can really easily by just entering anything in. However, I can kind of say as it's intended for programmers, that if you got an error, you didn't really beat the level, so that's one more thing to avoid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think it's really cool!
I kind of planned out some "target" goals, and some "reach" goals, and really managed to do most of what I first thought of, including the "reach"es. I think the game has a lot of potential if I were to continue to develop it, as the levels I made only scratched the surface of the possibility space.
The level design is also really diverse, there are intro sequences, timing challenges, puzzles, and things that are of a mix of everything!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    InputFields in Unity don't support rich text :C :C :C :C :C :C :C
What's up with that!?
I kind of had to work around that for like the entirety of the first third, and didn't get some of the style that I wanted. I'm ok with how that part turned out, but it would have been much nicer otherwise.
Also, I feel like making the "target" and "reach" goals really helped with efficiency and keeping myself focused on what was most important to complete.
Lastly, I definitely should not work in a room with loud people if I'm trying to be efficient! (though it does make it more fun, and also maybe helps with ideas, so I guess I didn't really learn which is best this time...)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hack Attack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think there should be some more structure to the code, like loops, multiline functions, etc.
Also it would be interesting if the two halves could interact in more ways.
