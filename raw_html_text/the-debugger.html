                    Inspiration: quiplash, DnD, twitch plays pokemon.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: Using css, html, javascript and php.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: After many hours we couldn't get the server to work through php, therefore it became a single player game rather than multiplayer.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: The storyline and how each decision can affect further decisions.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: Became more confident in html, css, php and javascript.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Debugger: To implement the server so that it actually works and we can have multiple users logging in and voting for the next decision that the main character makes.
