                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My teammates and I wanted to tackle an issue that would be challenging tech-wise. We were inspired by the dance dance revolution arcade machines at Price Center but we didn't wanna travel from ERC to use the machine. This lets us access a pose-off from our fingertips using basic laptop hardware.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Poser projects a livestream of the user, playing notes in a sequential order as the user poses correctly to the queue given.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized React in order to build a responsive app. In order to add Tensorflow functionality, Tensorflow.js was planned to be used after repurposing a pose estimation computer vision model through transfer learning on AWS. We got data for transfer learning by taking many pictures of our teammate Akhil posing.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues finding properly documented machine learning models for use in transfer learning. Ultimately we compromised on using a MobileNetV2 architecture built for ImageNet rather than pose estimation, readjusting the weights using our data.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have built a React app - many challenges were faced, but in end each challenge helped promote our understanding of React. We also enjoyed the opportunity to go through a transfer learning process for a practical application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding well documented machine learning code takes persistence.
