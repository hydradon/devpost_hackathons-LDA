                        What it does
                    </strong>
                    We used OpenCV, a computer vision library, to count up how much money you have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To identify dollar bills, we used facial detection to crop out the face on the bill and sent it to Google's Machine Learning API to figure out who's face it was (i.e. Washington = $1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To identify coins, we drew a square 1cm by 1cm on a piece of paper as a reference. Then, we use edge detection and contour detection to determine the radius of the coin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have an additional feature where we add up your scanned money, and recommend stocks based on what you can afford.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Applications
                    </strong>
                    Our project has many potential applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of them is to help blind people manage their cash. Using cash is essential day to day, and not being able to quickly and reliably count up money is a massive detriment to quality of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another application is to count up large sums of money. If you have multiple bills, it is easy to lose track of how much you have. This can lead you to spending more and saving less, since you don't have a clear idea of your balance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we could use this technology to help people save money. It is a nuisance to deal with change, but the loose discarded coins add up quickly. Our users can empty their pockets and instantly see how much money they have. That spare change could go towards investing in stocks, saving for a purchase, or splurging. Our app facilitates this process with the convenience of modern technology.
