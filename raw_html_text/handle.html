                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The three of us are roommates, and just before attending PennApps, all of us had to do some shopping in order to prepare for the long journey from Waterloo to Philadelphia. This was a waste of time as we had assignments which were due, classes that needed to be attended, and jobs that needed our applications. It was a mess. That's what inspired us to create
                    <strong>
                        handle
                    </strong>

                <p>
                    It saves you time and lets you earn money! The best combination, right?
We have divided our user group into 2 groups:
