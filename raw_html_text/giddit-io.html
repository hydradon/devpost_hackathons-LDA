                    This past summer I interned at a tech company in San Francisco.  Luckily, before moving to the west coast, I was able to find an apartment to rent with three other students from the university that I attend.  Everything seemed to be falling into place until we found out, on the first night of our stay, that there was a restaurant directly below our apartment that played extermely loud music until the early hours of the morning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I was able to moderate the disturbance by wearing earplugs, I couldn't help but keep thinking how I simply wished that I had known about this situation before signing to pay $1700 a month to live there.  We even had the place checked out by a friend before we signed a lease, but the restaurant downstairs was quiet during the day and so the problem was not immediately apparent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few months later, I met some prospective tenants waiting outside my door for a viewing of the apartment.  After initially just walking by them, I decided to turn around and enlighten them of the situation.  As you can imagine, they were extremely thankful!
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what about the people viewing the apartment that I didn't run into?  Or the ones that found the apartment online like I did?  How could I communicate with them?
                </p>
