                    Summary: Given a paper size and desired relative throwing velocity, our algorithm will create several "species" of planes, and selectively "breed" them to encourage formation of characteristics that perform well (fly the furthest) in a physical model. The project will output a paper folding pattern for an optimal plane which can be intuitively constructed by the end user.
