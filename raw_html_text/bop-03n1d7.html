                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People usually don't like being told what to do--even when it's important. Lately, the importance of environmental awareness has been emphasized. However, for as important as it is, people don't like to be preached about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BOP is an attempt to bring the awareness in a fun, challenging way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BOP is a video game where the rule is simple: don't let two boxes next to each other have the same color. Sounds simple enough, but our environment is always changing, and this change can lead to damage, and that is the challenge of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this game using the Love2D video game framework, Sketchbook pro for simple designs, and it is all programmed using the Lua programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lua was not our most fluent language, and the Love2D game framework has quite a few oddities. Also, repository interfaces can get a bit finicky once in a while. We also tried to use OpenGL way early in the project, but that did not go well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build a fully operational prototype for a game in under 36 hours. We'd say that this is quite an accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned quite a bit of Lua and some stuff about graphics design and programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BOP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of polishing, some expansion of some features, and a stronger emphasis on our environmental message.
