                    Andr&eacute;s likes to play pool. However, he finds it sometime hard to find people to play pool with him. Thus he thought it would be nice to have an app, as he described -- "Slack-like, but limited people based on location". He would like to use the app to send a message to everyone around, so that he could find someone to play pool.

                    It's a messaging app. There is nothing new about it.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the fiasco with
                    <em>
                        flask
                    </em>
                    templates in the previous hackathon (HackHarvard's "automeet"), I (Duy) decides to minimise the usage of
                    <em>
                        python
                    </em>
                    and
                    <em>
                        flask
                    </em>
                    in the project. Therefore, I went with my second most proficient thing I can do,
                    <em>
                        javascript
                    </em>
                    !
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a night, I both learning
                    <em>
                        react
                    </em>
                    and
                    <em>
                        javascript
                    </em>
                    while trying to integrating with the
                    <em>
                        python
                    </em>
                    backend.
