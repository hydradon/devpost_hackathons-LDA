                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Curiosity about the combined statistics of gamer profiles across platforms
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It retrieves and stores user data from PSN, XBL, and Steam. Then processes the data and provides the user a dashboard of meaningful statistics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the .NET Core 2.0 MVC framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    .NET Core framework changes from 1.X to 2.0. Not all platforms have official API's and proper API integration is not trivial. Algorithms for combining data from completely different models takes a lot of careful consideration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed and developed a solid back end and front end for this Web Application in under 36 hours. We have the API's thoroughly researched and have the Steam API integration nearly complete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing custom API integrations for unofficial API's can be difficult. .NET Core 2.0 is excellent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GamerDashboard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to continue to improve our model, integration algorithms, and user interface. We are also going to finish hooking up the other two platform API's and then hopefully launch our Web Application.
