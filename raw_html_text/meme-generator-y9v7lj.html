                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try out our coding skills while at the same time creating something fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Select which meme you want and the program will randomly return a meme of that type.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Python along with various Python libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Randomly pulling from a website was difficult because we had to go through the HTML on the website and pull specific links (and filter them out).
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Got it to work!
