                    The challenge with eliminating hunger is not lack of food. The challenge is getting donated food to the people who need it - food insecure neighbors. The Northern Illinois Food Bank has done a great job of providing food to much of northern Illinois. There are areas where there are no food pantries and there are people who are too ashamed to go to a food pantry or who cannot drive. This online ordering and delivery system solves those challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website allows people to place orders and choose delivery to their home or to nearby locations such as a library or community center. It also allows them to give back by helping to distribute food to others in their area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our system works by collecting user and order data and storing them in a database. Users are broken down into two groups: volunteers and neighbors.  If a user is a 'neighbor', they can place an order for pickup or delivery, which would then be processed and filled. If a user is a 'volunteer', they can choose from stored orders that need to be delivered and help to deliver them.
