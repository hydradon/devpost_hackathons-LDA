                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a project that would allow us to learn about how Unity works, and a little bit about how the code in Unity works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game where you run from your nightmares/shoot them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrated premade Unity assets and scavenged premade code.
We wrote the enemy AI and fixed over the shoulder camera movement, and player movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Troubleshooting errors was challenging and writing in C# was challenging with no prior knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to piece multiple things together in the Unity editor.
                </p>

                    What's next for Purple Nightmare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music! More sound effects! Levels! Guns! Stuff!
