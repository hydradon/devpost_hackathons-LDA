                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People do no get enough sleep these days. Often times it's because they get caught up with studying/work/chatting and forget it's time to go to bed. DailyDoze notifies you when it's 7 hours before the alarm you set for the next day to make sure you get enough rest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) user sets alarm for when they have to wake up 
2) user selects a youtube song they like 
3) exactly 7 hours before the alarm,  there will be a pop-up and the youtube song would play to remind them it's time for bed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) we built the web app using HTML, css, javascript and bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original plan was to prompt the use for their ideal amount of sleep and use that to personalize the notification time but we did not have enough time to implement it. As the ideal amount of sleep is 7-8 hours, we decided to use 7 as the number of hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) getting the pop up to work at the right time 
2) getting the youtube link to work
3) getting the alarm to work
4) making the web app look relatively cool
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Alarms are more complicated that we think, so are desktop notifications
2) we learned to find other ways to solve the problems
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DailyDoze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) An android app version 
2) Let users input their ideal amount of sleep and use it to calculate when the notification should pop up.
