                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted something "simple" yet interactive and entertaining.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was to have a player vs computer, but the player interaction did not work in time. Also, the user interface did not work as intended, as the merging of the engine with the GUI did not line up properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of us worked on the checkers engine, while the other worked on the user interface. It was not as optimal as we had liked, but we did our best to divide up the work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled to do our own work while making it run as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the engine to work and the GUI to work separately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's important to work on one project rather than trying to merge two.
                </p>

                    What's next for Checkers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the GUI and engine starting from one program.
