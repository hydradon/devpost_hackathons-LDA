                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Achim Jung, Lecturer at UoB, and his wonderful, confusing maths lectures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes his panopto lecture recordings, transcribes them, passes them through a markov chain library to output a unique confusing lecture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python hosted on a GCP VM, and a screenscraper to get all the recordings of his lectures, and download their .wav audio streams.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GCP is so powerful, and markov chains are a really smart way of processing text in a seemingly natural way
