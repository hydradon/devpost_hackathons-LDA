                    Home-ing Network
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helps the homeless by crowdsourcing information concerning the location of homeless populations in ATL.

                    What we did
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On homepage.html in vagrant/forum/templates , we created a basic posting function that submits information to a database. This information is then pulled from the database through vagrant/forum/app.py and displayed on the homepage with jinja. This pic is posted alongside past submissions, so that users can have a quick overview of where the homeless are at any given time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can click on the photo which will direct them to vagrant/forum/templates/pic.html where they can see the photo in higher resolution and view any additional descriptions of the photo.

                    Practical Implications
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to home in on the homeless population in order to close the gap between need and provision, improve demographic data, and ultimately get them into homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This network can help the government and other organizations to more efficiently meet the homeless where they are in Atlanta.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, this localized knowledge can inform demographers and supplement survey data by revealing hidden populations.
