                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to go back to the classics.  We wanted to come up with a type of game as a nod to the Oregon Trail.  We used fantasy elements because of the popularity with them nowadays with media like Game of Thrones and the Hobbit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game that prints out statements and gives the user options on how they would like to deal with the scenario.  When you choose the right option, you would advance.  If you choose the wrong option, you die and have to start at the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and if, else functions as the backbone for the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges that we ran into were coming up with a creative narrative for our game to follow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the teamwork and our resolve to finish this game and how well it turned out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about if, then statements and exactly how much code is required for a good game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tunnel of Darkness
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want the narrative to continue into new territory.  We would hope to create a game that would last longer and add more options for the player choices.
