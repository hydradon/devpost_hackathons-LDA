                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being passionate CS students, we wanted to make sure Konexio's volunteer mentors could train students with Cs and life skills that would make them independent and self sufficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It essentially is an Android app that allows refugee students to choose their volunteer mentors and be updated with their course progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java and NodeJs to create a database of students and mentors.We used Sketch and Invision to create an innovative design for the app. We used the Android studio emulator to build an Android app which connects the database and the design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn several languages that we were unaware of such as Nodejs to make the app work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully finishing the app
Creating an innovative design
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New languages

                    What's next for The Mentorship
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hope to take this forward into new cities and countries and mentor as many people as we can
