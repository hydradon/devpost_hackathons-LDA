                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really wanted young children to know more about their favorite fairy tales. Disney does a great job with their movies, however I believe children should know about classic tales as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My Alexa Skill at the current version tells Facts when a kid asks for a fact from fairy tale facts. It has over 200 users as of writing, and thanks to that motivation I am working on 2.0, which will allow children to say a character's name as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this by using my prior knowledge with lambda, making Alexa skills, and my inspiration to help kids!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The construction of the first version of the skill was simple for me, for I have a lot of experience in building those types of Alexa skills. The challenge came when I started to work out 2.0, which is a little above my head, but I am still working at it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the skill in general, and I am happy that I am getting more experience by working on this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that doing a little is easy, but a lot is hard. I will continue to push towards my end goal of a skill that will help children, and even I do not know where fairy tale facts will go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fairy Tale Facts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        2.0!
                    </strong>
                    In 2.0, I will have a more natural Alexa skill. Instead of having a wake phrase that might be hard for younger children, I will make something that truly feels natural to the child, just like they are speaking to another person.
