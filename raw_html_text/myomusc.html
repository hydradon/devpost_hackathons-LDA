                    We provide physical therapy in an enjoyable way. Less doctor visits, more fun.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Involuntary, uncontrollable muscle movements are characteristic of numerous conditions, such as dystonic tremors, stroke, or Huntington's disease. Physical therapy has been shown to be a non-invasive treatment that can help prevent the progression of and alleviate the symptoms of such conditions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What did we do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and the Myo, and the growing concept of gamification to produce therapy that promotes smooth, controlled arm movement. We detected "jitter" based on the Myo's detection of the user's movements, and made the game require more control when jitter is detected. This posed a natural reinforcement to improve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Myo/Unity API is established but limited. We needed to develop an interface to detect jittery movement, involving mathematical manipulation of many unfamiliar objects.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project demonstrates the ability of technology to be integrated with other fields. Virtual reality is a growing field, and the utilization of this technology to improve the livelihood of individuals illustrates its power and potential.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about many new technologies, and tinkered with all the toys available. We learned, more than anything, how much there is to learn. This hackathon allowed us to explore new fields and appreciate the massive amount of interest in technology, which inspired us greatly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're excited about how the Myo and other technologies can be used to help in other modes of physical therapy. The possibilities are endless, and we are excited to see how technology and medicine progress symbiotically together.
