                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being CUNY students that drive to school,  we end up being late to some of our classes because we can end up spending over an hour finding a parking spot. We came up with the idea, what if our fellow CUNY drivers can help us out by notifying us when they are leaving their parking spot.

                    Notifies users about soon to be vacant parking spots.
