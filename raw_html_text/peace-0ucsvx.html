                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to bridge the gap between deaf people and their peers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Translates speech or text to sign language to help users learn sign language and communicate with peers that use sign language. Users can record their voice or type to input text that they want to translate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Microsoft Azure's Speech SDK in an Android application written in Java, and wrote parsing logic on text input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with an idea and setting up the project uniformly was more than half the battle. Additionally, we had minor difficulties with version control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully translating speech to text to sign language, which can be used as a dictionary to help learn ASL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How there are so few resources for learning sign language
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are very few quality sign language translators.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Peace
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Peace is easily extendable as long as we add more words to the dictionary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We can also add context meaning, since not all words are used in the same context all the time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A side menu containing a history of sentences/translations that can be reused for quick reference.
