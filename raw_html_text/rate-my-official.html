                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired us was that too many people vote in elections, but then don't stay up to date on what the elected officials do after they are elected. We wanted to help connect people with their opinions on the work politicians are doing and how well they are doing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What it does is allow you to rate an official based on your State and City. Currently, you can choose if you want to rate the mayor of your city or one of the city council officials. It also allows you to see what the current rating average for a certain official is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Java for the back-end and Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML for the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was some difficulty with getting from designs drawn on paper to a design on the computer. In addition, there was some difficulty with the amount of layers Java required to get a working prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud that we both got our work done! It took a long time and the amount of bugs we found would have made a spider cry with joy, but it was a lot of fun and encouraging to see our working end results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that next time we should look into using C++ or a language that has better GUI capabilities. We also learned that we need to know how to work with databases and servers so as to have full-stack capabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rate My Official
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add the ability to search for a specific official, rather than only using drop down menus, adding comments, and having a database so that all of the entered information is kept, and relationships are created among the different data attributes.
