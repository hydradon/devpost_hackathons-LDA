                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solving the issue of capturing all important information being disseminated during a discussion session, class, meetings etc. It stems from our personal frustration with bad notes and class discussions which are forever lost due to not being recorded.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows teams to contribute ideas and information captured during a discussion session, class, meetings etc and generate a comprehensive note.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a backend Server using NODEJS hosted on Heroku, we also used HTML and CSS for the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As amateur javascript developers, we had to quickly build our skills using tools in web technology. We learnt together the fundamentals of cloud hosting, NodeJS, Linux Terminal, and APIs. It was very difficult for us to get the Slack API up and running but once we started, we were just busting through our code like trains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we can create a tool that as students, we can actually use to solve our own problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to quickly brainstorm, we also learned how to work in a group and find a middle-ground amidst the numerous ideas that are generated.

                    The following is our roadmap
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We want to support integration into other platforms such as Twitter
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We want to implement ML/AI to intelligently map each snippet of ideas together as the app will learn to understand the subject matter
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also want to integrate OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for each note-taking.
                    </li>
                </ol>
