                    One of us started playing smash recently and wanted to see how well he was doing compared to his friends. He wasn't able to find a good way to do this and though it would be a fairly simple thing to design
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    In its current form, you can log in or create an account, you can create groups of smash players and you can input games. The rest doesn't have front end but the backend allows you to add a character that you play in a group, allows people to be added to groups, and get all the games for a specific group.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We created a database that keeps track of all of the players, groups, games, and possible characters. We created php pages that return json that people can use to create calls to the database. We created some of the front end to control a lot of these features.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    4 hours was not enough time to implement both the front end and the back end for all of the features that we wanted.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We tested the backend manually and it worked well which we are proud of.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    A lot of basic javascript, php, html, css and sql things such as outputting json and processing that with javascript.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Next we are going to implement adding a character with the front end. We will implement an algorithm to determine which characters are doing the best based on the games that they have played in the past. There will also be a seasons feature where the leaderboard will reset every x amount of weeks so you can see your progress through the leaderboard over time.
