                <p>
                    The main purpose of this project is to create an application that will help reduce the amount of time that people spend on their phones at night right before they are about to sleep. Such habits are detrimental to one's health, and CatNap aims to help people who wish to change their nightly habits by providing a constant stream of notifications to deter them from staying on their phones as well as a statistics to track their sleeping-phone habits.
