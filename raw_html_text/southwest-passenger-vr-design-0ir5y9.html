                    For this project, we talked to Southwest Airlines and attempted to solve their problem: How can technology be used to foster hospitality in the airline industry? We thought about what emotions passengers feel while on the flight and how we could make their experience pleasant, even if they do not enjoy flying or are even scared of it. We realized that many passengers have severe anxiety as a result of flying, which is caused by nausea, claustrophobia, fear of heights, and other factors. 
In order to mitigate these ailments, we developed a system in which the passenger will be allowed to purchase and use a VR headset while on the plane, As a result of prompts from the system, a VR simulation will be played that will be customized to the user's fears. For example, we can prompt the user to indicate which of three options applies to them while flying, such as fear of heights, nausea, and claustrophobia. If they choose heights and nausea, this will map to a VR simulation of a car driving down a road, and this will play, followed by other simulation experiences that would not exacerbate their feelings like a canoe in moving water would. The intent of this project is to create a more pleasurable experience for passengers, especially those who experience anxiety and other negative symptoms while flying. 
We built this design by showing what the website would look like with the added functionality of choosing to buy the VR headset while booking the flight online beforehand. We also included the design for what the seat-back screen would look like with examples of how the system would prompt the user if they choose to use a VR headset on the flight. We included java code for the logic built into the system for how it chooses how to customize a list of videos that can be viewed by the user. It basically maps symptoms to videos that cannot be used if that symptom is present and removes that video from the list of options the user can view in their VR experience. 
The main challenge we ran into while developing this design was the lack of coding necessary for the project, unless we created the VR simulations ourselves, which we could not do due to a lack of time. 
We are very proud of ourselves for finishing our project enough to demo. We realized our project idea pretty late, and we are glad to be able to pitch the idea and to hopefully think more about and improve the idea for the future. 
We learned a lot about UX design and how to use concept maps to understand the logic of conditional statements.
For the company, this is a money-making move because the passenger will be able to order the VR headset during booking for a price determined by Southwest Airlines, and if they decide on the flight that they want a VR headset, they will have a slightly higher cost. The VR headsets will need to be bought, along with their respective wires and an Oculus Rift would work for this, but other off-brand VR headsets could work as well. And these would pay for themselves quickly after being rented by the passengers on flights.
