                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the United States, 1 in every 4 car accidents is caused by a phone distraction. 94% of drivers support a ban on driving while texting but 35% admitted to doing it anyways. Existing systems use various sensors to detect distraction but it's impossible to monitor every driver on the road. Additionally, these systems are expensive and extremely difficult to implement.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed an application that detects when a user is driving and texting based only their typing signature.
