                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make a game firstly with decent UI.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a mini version chess. The rule is very simple. The user whose chess sums up to 3 wins.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided this project into two parts. One is UI part, the other is the alogithm part.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm is a little bit tricky because there are three situations in total which should be considered of.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finially used video, audio to implement the final as a signal to tell who is the winner.

                    We learn how to build interactive UI using audio and video.

                    What's next for Tic-Tac-Toe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to build more complicated Tic-Tac-Toe, like 4x4, 5x5, or nxn. The algorithm is similar
