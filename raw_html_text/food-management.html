                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Almost daily, we see tons of food thrown down the trash in the dining hall. So, we thought, we may mitigate the environmental, financial and moral consequences of throwing away so much food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up a database which contains the number of days a food can be used for. Then, whenever the dining hall or a restaurant buys the food in bulk, they enter that amount in the system. Then, daily, with the help of production reports and manual entry, we track the food that we have in the stock and display the food that is going to spoil soon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used mainly Java and connected it to the Microsoft SQL server using JDBC. Then, we used Java Swing framework for our frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we wanted to set up the system as a web application but couldn't figure out. 
We tried using machine learning to predict the number of students that may come in dining at any given day, but it was too complicated for us.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could have done better. But, we are proud of the sleepless nights we pulled.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork, Java, Swing Framework, a Little bit about Google Cloud Platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Food Management
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue this on our own time and try to set it up on a web. We hope to implement machine learning and make full use of the Google cloud platform along with real-world data points.
