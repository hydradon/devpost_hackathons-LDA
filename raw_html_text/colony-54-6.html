                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Martian Chronicles by: Ray Bradbury, Deforestation, Colonization
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Survival game revolving around building and getting resources from your limited environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C# for coding and blender for modeling and put that all together in Unity. We used procreate for 2d art and for the backstory of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ended up making a lot more than we thought we would and that we would in the past. We also had some people who couldn't code or do much else revolving around game making so how much we achieved was surprising.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Colony 54-6
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to improve game mechanics, add a better inventory system, add a variety of npcs and other animals for ambience, improve the building system, add an oxygen system.
