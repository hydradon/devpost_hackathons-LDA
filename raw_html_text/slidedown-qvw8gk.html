                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, we had to make a set of workshops for one of our organizations at school. We created all of the curriculum in Markdown, so that it could be reviewed and changed easily, but once we were done, we had 10+ Markdown files to convert into actual slidedecks. That was our inspiration for SlideDown: a way to save time and effort when making slides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SlideDown is a command-line tool that takes in a Markdown file, parses through the content, and makes a Google Slides presentation that maintains the same content and formatting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SlideDown was made with a Python script that uses the Google Slides API to create slides and content. It's pure Python3 :).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest hurdles was figuring out how the Google Slides API worked. There is documentation available, but some of it can be confusing, especially for the Python implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the tool to actually make a presentation!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SlideDown
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement more tag support from Markdown, improve looks, actually get it working :^).
