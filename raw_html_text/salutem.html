"240 million 911 calls every year- FCC estimates that improving location accuracy could save over 10,120 lives annually." The lack of accuracy in 911 calls inspired a team to find a solution. Currently, exact patient  location is not given from 911 calls. EMT's &amp; Developers who wanted to make a change .

                    &bull;"In California, more than half of cellphone calls didn't transmit location to 911 from 2011 to 2013, and it's getting worse. Last year, about 12.4 million, or 63%, of California's cellphone calls to 911 didn't share location. "
