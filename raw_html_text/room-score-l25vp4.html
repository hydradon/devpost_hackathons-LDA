                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My teammates (My actual Roommates) and I always had disagreements as to who's doing their work on time. Some just DON'T do their fair share, while the others just claim they do more than the others.
We also had  a LOT of problems trying to coordinate on our shopping lists.
Altogether it is quite a stressful experience!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this application, we hope to keep track of all the activities that go about in a house or Room, and track whether people are doing their share on time! Also, we hope to use a 'Nearby' feature that lets a person find out if they're near a shop that his/her Roommate needs something from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But at the end of it all, why would ANYONE do more than what they're expected to do? Well, that's where RoomScore comes into the picture. With a RoomScore, we hope to assign points to each task and that way using this score we can keep track of everyone's score and keep everyone on the same level. If someone's score is lower than the rest, then its clear he's slacking!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from tasks, to make sure there's no foul-play we have a Review system, where your Roommates can use their best skill from Tinder and 'Swipe Right' on completed chores if they like what they see, and decline if its not done properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On top of that, hope that RoomScore will be taken as seriously as a credit score, and allow people to search for potential roommates based on their RoomScore to know how 'liveable' they are before they decide on moving in.
In a future scope, we hope that this RoomScore that portrays the way you live can be used as an education tool for kids that live in their parents house to "Build" a score that would teach them to be responsible human beings when they go off to college.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tip of the Ice-berg: We've integerated Alexa to keep track of each person's Chores and even help assign tasks to their fellow Roommates through Voice Commands with a simple "Alexa, Remind Jack to Take the Trash Out"
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>

                    With Love :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had speculations into people gaming the system, and that's where the Review card swiping system was introduced. Alexa was another problem since we couldn't save the inputs we give her to add tasks and user names. Pushing notification through Ionic was relatively hard as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a hybrid application, which is a relatively new concept, and its challenges that came along with push notifications and backend integration. We were able to successfully deploy Android, iOS and Mobile Web Browser. 
The back-end API server was configured and deployed on a DigitalOcean cloud instance successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to Amazon Echo's Alexa and making the Lambda function work for us, instead of the other way round! ;) 
We learned how to develop and deploy a FullStack application based on MEAN stack.
We also learned how push notifications servers, and learned how LoopBack framework works which seemed to be pretty good for REST APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Room Score
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a future scope, we hope that this RoomScore that portrays the way you live can be used as an education tool for kids that live in their parents house to "Build" a score that would teach them to be responsible human beings when they go off to college.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also hope that RoomScore will help people get good deals on Apartments as a pay off for being a responsible Roommate.
