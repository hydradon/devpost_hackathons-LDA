                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we just wanted to create a simple platformer with unique but still relatively easy to understand controls. We did originally have the idea behind giving the bot a toaster to shoot out toast projectiles as a form of propelling themself towards a direction. However due to time restrains we couldn't get that mechanic working and instead made the bot just jump around as if he was in Zero Gravity. The unique physics with walls we found out caused us to name the game demo "Project F.L.I.P"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is practically just a physics simulator that showcases some of the game's engine and more on how flipping around on walls work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to challenge ourselves by creating the game in Unity, a program that was considered alien for us. While we couldn't get everything working, we at least got our ideas down and worked with what we had for a less than 24 hour time period including sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially there were issues limiting jumps and the jump heights were in fact inconsistent. However we utilized those mechanics to our advantage for the physics simulator as it created a unique experience. The constant fluctuations of the physics did prevent making more than one level as its more of a physics showcase rather than a 100% functional demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We overall liked the pixel art we've accomplished and we finally got to try a popular game engine and we are proud of what we have on our first day of using unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a greater depth on what Unity offered and it's specifics and it was a great learning experience as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project F.L.I.P
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll probably utilize the toast mechanic and make it just a singular jump with two extra ways to maneuver in the air to create more interesting movement WHILE having actual level design making the game turn more as a platformer instead of a sandbox. We might also fix some physics bugs and make a button that restarts where the character is facing.
