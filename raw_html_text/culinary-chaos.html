                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, when we saw the words "Into the Rabbit Hole," only one word came to mind: Immersion. Our goal for the next 36 hours was simple, create the most enthralling and lasting experience we could probably build. With that said, we introduce Culinary Chaos: a hectic multiplayer-cooperative cooking simulator!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows two players to stand side by side in the kitchen of a small burger joint. However, there&rsquo;s a significant catch: the person on your left or right side stands in front of equipment and ingredients that you do not have access to and, similarly, you have access to items that he or she has no access to. The goal is to work together, or aimlessly chuck things at each-other, in order to construct the orders placed and keep the restaurant from falling under.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using a VR headset of your choosing or a simple web browser, users can literally immerse themselves into an intense cooperative multiplayer game without any controller at all! Using our leap motion, your hands become the controllers as you work yourselves to culinary greatness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although none of us had
                    <strong>
                        ZERO
                    </strong>
                    experience with Unity, we decided to dive head first into the deep end and program the entire project utilizing the software and C# due to unanimity as well as the implementation of various hardware platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On that note, hardware wise, we utilized a leap motion tracking camera in order to provide accurate and real time hand tracking/positioning. With this, the users of the application are able to completely immerse themselves within the environment and do not need a controller or any other specific technology in order to play the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, using teleportal, we are able to port our Unity application to nearly any VR compatible device as well as websites and mobile devices. Teleportal took care of a lot of the backend that would have been coded by us if we were to pursue multiplayer implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Surprisingly, the most difficult of challenges turned out to be the least expected and most trivial ones. For example, we wasted hours trying to import assets that did not seem to import properly no matter what we tried. However, after hours of digging and finicking, we realized that an update on our Blender software solved every import problem we came across! We ended up succeeding on the things that we personally thought would require the most effort/take the longest and struggling miserably on the tasks we thought were easy and trivial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our number one accomplishment is to have a functional application by the end! We are extremely thrilled that our efforts did not prove unfruitful and that we were able to come out of the hackathon with a product we were very proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Literally no one in our team had utilized Unity to the extent we had over the past 36 hours; although it provided a breath of fresh air to learn a new technology we had never interacted with, it also provided a lot of frustration to learn all the ins and outs of a fairly robust game-development interface. However, the four of us walk out of the debris triumphant and fulfilled that we were able to create a product that we are sincerely proud of and do so using a tech that was so novel to all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Culinary Chaos
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We see endless room for expansion! From entertainment to even cuisine training, no longer would one be encumbered by the lack of personal culinary talent.
