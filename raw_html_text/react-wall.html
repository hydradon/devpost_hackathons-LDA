                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wake up every morning hoping to watch videos of people reacting to other videos. However, how much time is lost switching from one video to the next? With React Wall, you can finally watch all of those reactions in one place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React Wall creates a singular Brady Bunch-style wall of video reactions to movie trailers.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React Wall uses IVA's API to call movie trailers and Ziggeo's API to record, share, and store video reactions.

                    Challenges I ran into

                    Coding is hard.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I only started learning to code a few months ago. This is my first hackathon, and the first time I've integrated API's into a program. I'm proud that it functions.
                </p>

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned how to integrate 2 APIs!
