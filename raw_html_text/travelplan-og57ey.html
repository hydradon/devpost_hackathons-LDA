                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates travel a lot and usually is very low on budget and time. She usually has only a day or two to travel in a big city, because of this she struggles to find places to visit to make the best use of her time. Our project aims to solve this problem by generating a day schedule for the user!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It starts by requesting the user's current location and asking for the user's preference in range (as in how far they're willing to travel). Then it generates a list of landmarks around the area. The user will be able to pick and choose/prioritize the list to indicate his/her interest. Then our program will compile out a schedule!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Maps API to deal with current location, finding places, and gathering information of each place. We also used javascript, html, and css to create the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled to use Google Maps API and javascript, especially with the get request. We also struggled with how to set everything up because it is our first time using everything we used for this product. Lastly, we struggled with ajax to connect server and client together to create a matrix (part of our pathfinding algorithm).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get the website working with parts of the project we have. We were able to figure out Google Maps API and gathered information for nearby places!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of html, javascript, css, reactjs, and Google API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TravelPlan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates are planning to go back and redo everything we did to get the application working! We are definitely seeking other ways of creating the product.
