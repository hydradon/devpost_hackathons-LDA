                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was to make an interesting 2D puzzle game. Based on previous experience in combining games (pokemon go + scrabble = grabble). I decided to make tetris with letters. Although due to time constraints only implemented most of the basic tetris.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has most of the Tetris functionality. You can pause the game, rotate bricks, speed them down, move them left and right, they get destroyed once one row is full. Although there are some bugs with collision, and some features such as showing what the next block will be are not added yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Unity. I followed some guidelines online and took the gridline
                </p>
                <h2>

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned a lot about Unity. This software isn't so foreign to me anymore, I also improved my C# knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use Unity, certain things about C#, learned to debug better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tetris Game in Unity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is adding the missing features and implementing the original idea. Having blocks filled with letters and having blocks dissapear based on words they form and not by filling the rows.
