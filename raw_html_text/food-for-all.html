                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inequality is visible every where we turn, and can manifest itself in many forms such as discrimination or income. However, food is the bare necessity to survive - With rising rent costs and many pounds of leftover food gone to waste in new York city, we were inspired to create Food For All.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food for All is a geolocator of free food near you - FFA pulls from facebook events, RSS feeds, and emails to update its constantly refreshing database. All of these events are then displayed on a mapping API on our front end.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front End: Python Flask + HTML/CSS + GeoPy.Nominatim
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back End: 
Facebook API, RSS feed scraper to update events table
Multinomial Na&iuml;ve Bayes model to classify text, built with python Scikit-learn
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many variations of text encoding for analysis. Facebook's API is hard. Jinja2. Inconsistency in RSS feed formatting.
                </p>
