                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have an expense tracker application in my mobile but i never use it because i have to manually add the amount and the item i purchased where has saying that i have got 10$ groceries is easy and system will understand and add the money and item for the tracking which saves my time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it helps people to add their day to day expense easily by just saying add 120$ for groceries even you can get the expenses that present beforehand also allows to update and delete the item as well
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i build it using alexa developer, node.js, serverless lambda function, dynamo db.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the challenge was to create the intent for each attribute and category which was very challenging because machine needs to understand the intent of the human as well
                </p>
                <h2>
