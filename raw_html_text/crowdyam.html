                    It is often a bummer if you want allow your friends to control the music on a party, gathering, etc. Therefore we're trying to solve this issue by allowing your friends to control the currently playing music using their phone. Current solutions either require your friends to create an account or grant them complete control over the music player which often results in disagreement about the music choice.
                </p>

                    We are builing a box which contains a music player and can be connected to an external stereo system. The box allows your friends to control the currently playing music by track links (e.g. spotify) to a whatsapp, telegram, etc. chatbot. The music player in accompanied with an administration web ui which lets you see the music queue and offers basic music functionalities such as pausing the musing or skipping the current track.
