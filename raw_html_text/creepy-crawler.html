                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CyberSecurity is a major focus of the group members, so naturally we were concerned with end user security. We know that not everyone knows how to detect phishing websites. We are familiar that Chrome has an internal software to detect malicious websites through certificates so we drew inspiration from that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creepy Crawler's intention is to protect the end user from malicious and phishing websites.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creepy Crawler would have a local database that would store a list of websites that the Creepy Crawler addon would reference to when checking URL's for their content. It would store the depth of the website. If it determined that it was a shallow website, it would prompt the user to proceed with caution. This setting up a flag. In the database, the flag  would count if the user decided to proceed, and based on how many users proceeded to the website- it would make an exception to the URL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We constructed our own WebCrawler through PHP coding and then implemented into our website. Our website hosts Github Pages, Domain.com, and Heroku App. The Heroku app is able to run our PHP file through our website so that an end user could access it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to our lack of knowledge of google extensions, we were unsuccessful in building a web extension that would read in the url before loading to check if the website was safe for the user to load into.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also ran into an issue of reading in input into a PHP file, we also have no knowledge of PHP coding so we were only able to run a WebCrawler that can read one hardcoded url.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, we had problems linking an extension to a our domain website that would run the PHP file and setting up a database to store all of the information that the WebCrawler would

                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The WebCrawler and the hosting of a WebCrawler through our domain!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also proud of the fact that for many of us it was our first hack-a-thon, and all that we learned truly helped in expanding our knowledge!

                    What We learned

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We learned a great portion of PHP coding, mostly basics so we have a broad concept of PHP.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We definitely learned a great deal of HTML formatting and web design.

                    What We would do differently
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We would run our scripts in python for its friendly environment. Of course now we have better knowledge of how to approach hack-a-thons, so next time we can come more prepared.
