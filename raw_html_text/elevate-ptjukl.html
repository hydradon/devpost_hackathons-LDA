                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Public speaking, and communication in general, is an essential skill; it allows individuals to portray their strengths and personality to an audience, interviewer, manager, co-worker etc. We created Elevate as a safe space for people to work on their public speaking skills by receiving immediate feedback on the quality of their speech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Elevate gives users feedback on their expressions, long pauses, overused words etc. - ensuring you don't make those mistakes in an interview or proposal using personalized statements from analyzing the sentiment level of the sentence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Cloud's Speech to Text and Natural Language APIs to allow us to convert the raw data received from the video and audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with integrating the API with node.js in the beginning, and also struggled with integrating all the individual parts together with Google Storage. Also, using the camera to record and download the video for transcription was new for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going from not knowing at all how to incorporate API's into our code to using multiple! In addition, creating a visually pleasing and user-friendly interface and something fairly working to demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned our strengths and weaknesses as individuals and as a team. We learned Back-End is not an absolute nightmare as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Elevate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to successfully seamlessly integrate all working parts together to have a fully functioning app and to also upgrade to live stream annotations and analysis.
