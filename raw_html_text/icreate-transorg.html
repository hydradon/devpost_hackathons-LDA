                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team came up with the idea of having flying machines that wont require any runway, catapult mechanism, 
retrieving mechanism and still efficient enough to fly longer durations and larger distances. We began working on 
this 36 hours back and have now been able to produce a design to create a Super easy to use utility drone that could be used to deliver packages in future and can be used for medical deliveries at much cheaper 
price point .
                    <br>
                    With everyone else looking to solve the problem of more flight time with better batteries the team is looking to do 
that through aerodynamics and see the drones as utility not just for bigger firms but also for consumer
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It flies as both a conventional plane as well as a helicopter with higher efficiency as compared to multicopter and higher payload to be used for medical deliveries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have done some calculations and have come up with a CAD model along with some flow simulations and animation to visualise what we are envisioning. Along with that we have also done case studies for a future execution
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing such an aircraft is a challenge in itself, we had to overcome the pain points of a helicopter and a plan, have to make sure that the characteristics become feasible
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designed a never been done before concept of a morphed delta wing having hybrid characteristics
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt different characteristics and aerodynamic parameters that must be taken care of while designing an aircraft along with a techno management and techno economical solution
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Icreate TransOrg
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well we will try to find feasible way to create a hybrid vehicle for VTOL and CTOL to do these kinds of deliveries in real worlds
