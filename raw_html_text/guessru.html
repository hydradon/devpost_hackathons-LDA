                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the days in high school where we would sit in the library playing GeoGuessr instead of doing work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GuessRU essentially is GeoGuessr, except limited to the Rutgers New Brunswick campus. Users will hit buttons to guess which campus they are on based on the Streetview.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS to build our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Occasionally, no Streetview image would be shown. So, we implemented an error checker that refreshes the page until a proper image is shown.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works (and on mobile)!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never give, never surrender. Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. Sometimes your original idea is too lofty and you have to ground it in reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GuessRU
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scoring features, such as correct guessing streaks and highest score.
                </p>
