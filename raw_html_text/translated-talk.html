                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gonzalo: "I'm from Barcelona, and my English is absolute shit." When I first came to PennApps I had a hard time making a team in part due to communication problems. After finding a team, we discussed that current language translation tools are very awkward to use, and can't be used to talk to people remotely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then decided to solve this problem by creating
                    <strong>
                        Translated Talk
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What Translated Talk does is set up a phone call between two people. A user selects a person to talk to from their contacts list or dials a number of their choosing. The application then detects their preferred language and all communication that they hear is in their preferred language. The application utilizes speech-to-text, text-to-speech. and a translation API. I can have a full conversation with someone without knowing a single word of their language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Our first choice of  a translation API was deprecated. 
-Setting an order of communication between the phones
-Designing the protocol of communication to share messages
-Dealing with speech-to-text errors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works and Gonzalo is happy =)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use Firebase and also to plan out a high-level architecture of the system we needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Translated Talk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Enable Translated Talk for nearby communication using NFC. This would be helpful for tourists and travellers.
-Incorporate this technology in video calls.
-Expand the platform to allow multiple users in one conversation (e.g. conference calls)
