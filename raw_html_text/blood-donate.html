                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that connects users to blood donor clinics. There isn't any app like ours that connects users directly to donor clinics. Our app transforms the conventional way of blood donation campaigning and paves a way for digital revolution in the area of blood donation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app directly connects the user to the blood donor clinic. Initially, the user needs to sign up where he needs to put in his desired username, desired password, email, city, state and his blood type and later needs to pass a test to see if he is allowed to donate blood. He will then be prompted to a screen where he can find the nearest blood donor clinic. Simultaneously, his information gets stored in a database, which the donor clinics can access and contact the donor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to do the majority of the coding and layouting. We used Google Firebase as a database to store the user's information and is accessible by the donor clinics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty connecting Firebase to Android Studio. There was an error in the gradle, which we eventually fixed. Some 'toast' messages were not popping up and some 'intents' were not passing, but they are working now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have a fully functional app that accesses various activities and the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt and elevated our Android Studio and Firebase skills
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blood Donate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to improve the layout of our app. We also need to improve the efficiency of our app.
