                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this application from ideas of combining Snapchat and Instagram together. We wanted to design an application on a platform we haven't used as frequently so we chose Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application, when fully designed, will allow users to join "events" where their is a single video that is created by stitching together videos uploaded by the users in that event. For example, if my family and I went on vacation, we would create an event called "Summer 2015 Los Angeles" and each of my family members could upload a video whenever they see something cool so that by the end of the trip there is one video with all the parts stitched together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using Android on the client side, Java web server on the server side, and MySQL as the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of uploading the video files from Android to the web server for processing since by that time we were exhausted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our ability to spin up and produce an Android application as fast as we did without much prior experience.
                </p>

                    What's next for Narrative
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue developing the application so that we can publish it in the Google Play store
