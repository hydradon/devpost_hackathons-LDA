                    There is an entire space of information that doesn't come from textbooks, but from experience and spread of wisdom. While you can attain some of this knowledge through a good conversation, another medium are blog posts.

                <p>
                    And, so, this hack provides a minimal (in amount of data available) search engine for asking some of these questions.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>How to do fundraising?
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Googling will give you spammy results and Quora doesn't provide answers on a more solid level. However, Monastery provides a quote summary and link to a blog post by Paul Graham, which excellently answers the question.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>What do my instincts mean?
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    For the midlife crisis crowd, Google returns dictionary definitions and Quora considers the question synonymous with the phrase "following your instinct". However, Monestary will provide you with a LessWrong blog post that discusses instincts as well as purpose of life.
