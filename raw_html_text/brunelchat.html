                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When starting their first year of university, some students decided to create a group chat for people on their courses using WhatsApp. However, not everyone has WhatsApp/knew about the group chat or wanted to join using their phone number. We decided to create an app where students can login with their student network ID and password and join the group chat for their course.

                        share documents and links with other students
