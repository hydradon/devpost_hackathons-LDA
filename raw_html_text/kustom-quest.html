                    We saw adventure games of old and wondered,"why has there not been a game where you made the adventure?"and so the game had come into idea,but we needed to expand the thought into a full fledged text based adventure game,where you can choose two time periods,two settings per period,two companions per settings,and seven scenarios depending on the setting but the right answer will change depending on who/what you chose as a companion,so there are different ways to play,and that idea has come to fruition now.We used python to code this but a google doc to come up with the ideas,we came into problems when putting Easter eggs,but they were solved quickly.
