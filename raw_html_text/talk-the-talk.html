                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because computer science is such a male-dominated field, women and non-binary people often feel unable to voice their opinions and ideas. As a result, hesitation regarding the ability to clearly and assertively articulate ideas can suffer. 
Our VR app provides the tools needed to build confidence and communication skills through a customizable VR environment that provides specific, constructive, and real-time feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Talk the Talk provides a reality-based , customizable VR environment so you can practice speaking in public and articulating your ideas - hence, building confidence. 
The customization aspect of the project means you can stimulate practice in your classroom, on a stage or in front of a crowd.
The VR environment prevents distraction by maintaining focus within VR headset.
As you speak, your connected device ( laptop in our case ) , works real time with IBM Watson to analyse what you're saying and detect how much and when you hesitate.
Once you're done ( as you say 'Watson stop recording') You see a speech to text translation of what you said on the screen and a score of how much and where you hesitated.
Cognitive research shows that context-dependent encoding (i.e. practicing in the critical environment) significantly improves performance

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Used Google Cardboard Unity SDK
IBM Watson Speech to Text API ( For conversions and analysis )

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the VR code to work and the VR experience be smooth
Integration of IBM Watson into unity
Ensuring the user-experience, apart from the VR, like talking to Watson was also smooth

                <p>
                    To believe that things work if you work hard and give them time. I also am glad I got to meet so many cool women in Tech.

                    Some Places where the VR app can help

                            Forty-six percent men always negotiate salary following a job offer, compared to just 30% of women. VR apps like this can help you build confidence for negotiating job/salary offers.
