                    Inspiration: I own a Bearded Dragon and one day his basking light burned out. I didn't know what kind to buy so i had to google it last minute at the store, but there were so many websites to go through. Then i wondered how much info about my pet i didn't know. I wanted to learn more about what kind of diet he should have, what lightbulbs to buy, things like that. i decided other people would want to know too, and making a website for it was the perfect opportunity to learn more about Beardies, and teach other people at the same time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It teaches people how to care for Bearded Dragons, what cages to buy, what to feed them, what they are.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: i built it using a website called codepen.io, using HTML and CSS.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: It was challenging to learn the codes, and i had to get every single letter right or else it wouldn't work.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I'm really proud of how well it turned out, I wasn't  expecting to put this much  time and effort into it, but it definitely paid off. I'm proud I stepped out of my comfort zone and learned something new that i thought would be difficult.
                </h2>
                <h2>

                </h2>
