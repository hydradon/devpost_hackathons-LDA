                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept behind the management system solves the problem for all Commerce Event Marketing. Right now each Chamber is producing their own list of events although each Commerce shows support for one another. Our solution allows the chambers to build a larger network by creating a more diverse web and increasing communal awareness.
An administrative web-app to aid in Chamber marketing for future events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A one stop medium that allows multiple Chamber Organizations to upload, edit, and share their list of upcoming and previous events held by any Chamber. A Chamber can opt to sign up and form its profile to add to the pool of listed events. The events are built simply and quickly with minimal design from the Chamber. Simply type the event name, location, time, and costs. The event is then auto populated into a post which has an option for the Chamber to add a unique background to fulfill a theme.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This reduces the effort of sending people to multiple organizational sites and increases the local awareness with the merged network from of all Chambers who signed up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply send users to one page and they can discover similar events from similar organizations, volunteer, connect vendors to events, and donate via PayPal's embedded payment processing system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Firebase as our database and hosting platform we combined React, HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS in order to create a Functional UI that allows a fluid UX from both the user side and the Chamber side.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest problem we had was in the amount of creative freedom. Pulling back big ideas into more manageable ones within the 48 hour time frame.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the features we were able to contribute within this time frame and a solid foundation which the Black Chamber of Commerce can easily implement our application into their own framework.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Design is crucial and project vision needs to have a step by step process which leaves room for testing and merging.
