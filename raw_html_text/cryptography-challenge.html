                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ceaser Cipher is an interesting challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decoded many ciphers using python programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python functions to translate a coded message into proper English.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using permutations library in python and applying it to the .txt file. I also had trouble understanding Alberti and Porta Ciphers. They were complex mathematical concepts that were very difficult to decipher.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solved two Ceaser Ciphers and one Permutation Cipher.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming languages could be used to decode hidden messages. Not only that but programming languages can also help translate new languages not known to mankind.
                </p>

                    What's next for Cryptography Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will develop more coding skills and expand my mathematical knowledge to solve even more difficult ciphers.
                </p>
