                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make a app that served as a welcoming community for aspiring and professional artists of all ages.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can look at different types of art and filter your searches through keywords and age. You can give up votes and feedback, and leave comments.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through MIT app inventor 2.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the people in our group had never used the program we used for this project, and were struggling to learn it.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The icons that were created seemed very professional and clean.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work together as a team with people with various skill levels, and were previously strangers.

                    What's next for upstART
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly make more categories so every artistic genre is represented. We would also collaborate with prominent museums and galleries.
