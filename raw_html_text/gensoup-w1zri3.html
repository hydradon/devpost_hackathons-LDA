                <p>
                    Family History is already big in the US, but only beginning to become popular in Europe - especially Central and Eastern Europe. Traditionally only elderly people engage in family research, but due to the popularity of the Internet and the increasing availability of online resources, also younger people in Europe jump the train and become interested in their families' past. What is missing up until now is a service, which is genuinely European, understands the specific needs of European researchers and builds upon cooperation of and networking with local and regional companies, non-profit organizations, government institutions and individual users - experts and beginners alike.

                    At its core, GenSoup is an online platform which enables users to enter or import their family trees and to help them with their research. The first part of GenSoup is now in private beta and can be tried and tested at

                    . There are several features still missing, right now we are in negotiations with business angels to raise capital for completing the development process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GenSoup is by no means bugfree yet, but the private beta already shows where our journey is going.

                        - GenSoup has gone great lengths to support many available GEDCOM dialects in order to make it possible for users of older desktop applications and other online services to import their data with almost no loss. Specifics of various systems can be configured via an elaborated filter system in the administration backend.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GenSoup is built upon the Zend framework, using MariaDB for speed and all the usual tools like JavaScript, jQuery, php, HTML5, svg and Apache. No Flash or Java is required on the users' side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We underestimated the complexity of the project in the beginning and it took us some time to bring the various aspects under one roof. For example: We strive to support GEDCOM completely as well as all the dialects created by the variuos software vendors. This means, we need interfaces for all those possible fields and, on the other hand, we have to protect our users from this overwhelming complexity. To achieve this, we've built custom forms for every thinkable event and put those fields, which are not usually used for this type of event, into a second input level. This way we offer simple forms for beginners and casual users but also all the complexity an expert user needs.

                    The creation of GenSoup is an ongoing creative process. We have learned many things about creating a complex platform, but we're sure that there will be more to learn on the road ahead of us.

                    Right now we are in contact with Business Angels in order to secure funding for the remaining development and the public beta test. If everything goes according to plan we will start public beta in Spring 2016 and enter regular business by the end of 2016.
