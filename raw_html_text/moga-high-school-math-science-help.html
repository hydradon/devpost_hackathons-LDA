                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the struggling hours spent on doing homework every night
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It solves equations and gives you definitions of important terms in a broad variety of subject areas including multiple levels of Math (pre-calculus, geometry, trigonometry, algebra), Physics (including quantum mechanics), Biology and Chemistry. This information can be used for solving/doing homework or studying for tests and quizzes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded the Math section in Python and the Science section in Java and provided a link to the java program in the Python one and vice-versa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since two of our group members only knew Python, while the other two knew only Java it was difficult to utilize our skill sets in conjunction (The Python folks did the math section while the Java ones did the Science section). We explored many ways to make a program that could use both languages, and in the end, we solved this issue by coding two independent programs, one in Python and the other in Java and providing a link to each in both.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were efficient and coded over 1300 lines of code in around 6 hours even though we spent a long time trying to merge our codes. We were able to figure out a good way to utilize the diverse skill sets of our team members. We created a program that is useful to all high school students since everyone can use a tool that helps with homework.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that it's a bad idea to try and mix langauges
