                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a multiplayer battle game for kids in which they could battle against each and have fun with interactive experiences and challenges
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a multiplayer battle game with echo buttons. The aim of the game is to trap the opponents character by attacking them. The trapped player then tries to escape the trap using the provided commands, once the character has escaped from the trap, they get the chance to attack the opponent. The longer a character stays trapped the more life it loses, so the players have to be quick in attacking and escaping
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Jovo Framework, it is a javascript based language for building Alexa Skills. I used AWS Lambda for hosting the logic of my skill, S3 for hosting static assets like audio files and images. DynamoDB for persisting user data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I ran into some trouble getting the echo buttons to work as I wanted.
