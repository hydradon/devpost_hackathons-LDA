                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>In the United States, grocery stores throw away 13.3 billion pounds of food every year &mdash; about half of these foods are still safe for consumption. As our landfills accumulate with more trash, 41 million stomachs continue to stay hungry. Over the years, this issue has grown to large extremes, and as both hackers and humanitarians, we decided to do something about it by creating a website Interface.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>    Our organization, Passionfruit, serves to deliver leftovers from food markets and local businesses to shelters and establishments that can help feed those who are homeless, living in food deserts, or cannot afford a healthy meal. This web app allows for those businesses to put their goods up for donation on our site and lets shelters claim those goods for pickup on the same day. During the food delivery process, the food is inspected by taking a picture of it and letting our machine learning algorithm evaluate its freshness. As the food delivery exchanges hands, QR codes on designated boxes are scanned to authenticate registration of the food delivery. We want to see the global community united by the availability of foods that help everyone live a healthy lifestyle, using our passion for computer science.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  Using CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, and Python, we put together a website built on a base of javascript (with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap), and then utilized PHP to link the python machine learning code to the rest of the site. We used a variety of API's some key ones being google maps and tenser flow.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> At first, we had difficulty picking an idea to base our hack out of because we wanted to serve the community with a really thought out plan. We started to hack at a later time, and it was our first time coding a website using HTML so it was a bumpy road. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We were able to create an online community service project that would actively engage and benefit our community. We kept in mind at as urbanization continues to grow, smart cities must be able to combat growing food insecurities in the US, and ultimately, all over the world. We use our knowledge to advance humanity one stomach at a time.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We learned that we still have room to develop as hackers. We had difficulty in using HTML and building websites, and would in the opportunity like to incorporate our strengths -- coding games and design -- into future projects like these.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Passionfruit
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>   We will continue working on this project to further benefit the community by working on how to better connect businesses and consumers. We realized this project isn't a one-time-and-done thing. We deeply cared about this project, even going to the lengths of calling different food stores and shelters to gather more information about the project.
