                    This workshop will walk you through how to build and deploy a simple Python app that serves a simple webpage that fetches data from the Google Maps API.

                    ! This branch serves as the base for what we'll be building off of. Starting off, we won't be touching the

                    </code>

                    Great, so how do I get started? If you've set up the project properly, you should find the
                    <code>
                        main.py
                    </code>
                    file in the folder. Open it up with your editor of choice. We've provided 3 examples in the file. We can get our
                    <code>
                        Flask
                    </code>

                    <code>
