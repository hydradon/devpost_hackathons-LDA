                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by many things. In particular, we wanted to do something that focused around the theme of this year's hackathon while also acknowledging 2020 as the onset of a new decade and of new goals. New Year's resolutions can almost be seen as an annual tradition at the start of every year, yet we tend to forget about them after a few weeks. We decided to create an app that not only keeps people accountable for their resolutions, but also motivates to continue strive for them on a daily basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a user-friendly interface and an aesthetically-pleasing layout, users will be able to record their resolutions and add visuals, making their goals seem more real. By also allowing users to connect and share resolutions with their friends and other users, users will be able to interact more with their goals and the goals of their friends, fostering a community of goal-achieving and dedication year-round!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using HTML and Figma. Figma was used to display our full intentions for the app through an interactive prototype. In terms of the coding, html was used to make the core of the app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We walked into this hackathon with 0 experience in coding. Because of this, there was a definite learning curve we had to overcome to begin this project and see it to completion. However, this hackathon was very accommodating to beginner hackers and we learnt an abundance of different skills that I wouldn't have learnt elsewhere. It was definitely a big challenge navigating the different languages and programs that we were able to use, along with balancing the importance of aesthetics and functionality.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that our team was actually able to produce a project that works (to an extent) and that we are proud of. We came into this hackathon hoping we would learn new skills but also create something that could help increase a person's quality of life. From coming in with absolutely no coding experience, we are able to help people stay on track with their goals and share their aspirations with friends and family through our app.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This weekend has taught us a lot about technology, what we enjoy doing, and the opportunities that lay ahead of us. We were exposed to so many different programs and languages, and we had a quick glimpse into a handful through trial and error, different workshops, and the mentors. Furthermore, through the project, we learnt the different aspects of creating a project (i.e. front-end, backend, etc.) and we all have a deeper understanding of what we like to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 2020: Mission for Change
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a new passion instilled in us, we believe 2020: Mission for Change will reach new heights. As we begin to learn more languages and how to use the different programs, 2020: Mission for Change will go from a prototype to a fully functioning app. We can see it growing to be a great way for users to share their goals and bond with others.
