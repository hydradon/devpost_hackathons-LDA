                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a timetable generator, but scrapped that idea due to complications. Then we decided to code an app that can find the fastest route between 2 stations, along with the duration it takes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program allows us to find the shortest route between 2 MRT stations and the time needed to travel from one station to another. Just enter the station to begin with and the destination station, and the shortest possible time to be traveled would be generated. Well I guess, 189 takes forever to come.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        How we got the travelling time between 2 stations: YouTube videos show the full ride of one line, from there we can extrapolate the times to find the travelling time between 2 stations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        So we tried coding the fastest way, but ran into many issues, such as inaccurate timing or variable timings.

                <p>
                    Wanted to use SceneBuilder, however some issues rendered it impossible.

                    Nothing Really. Or that Google maps was kinda inaccurate.
