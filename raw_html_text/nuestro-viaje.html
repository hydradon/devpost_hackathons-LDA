                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Immigrant teens are all over and they don't have a set resource to connect with one another. The connection through stories helps another person be able to open up more and share their experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects teens who emigrated from other countries, but mostly in Latino countries, through stories to help create a sense of community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Cloud 9 with HTML and CSS for our basic webpage. We then later used a bootstrap to enhance it further to create the navigation tabs and the wire framing. We created a repository on GitHub and transferred all the files we previously had before and built onto our webpage further.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the log in page was probably the hardest and having it redirect to the origin page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time we created a group website and have it completed. Along with this being our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to incorporate a GitHub repository, as well as, Cloud 9 into our development process.

                <p>
                    Expanding the website further. Also, spreading awareness about our site to further expand our demographic.
