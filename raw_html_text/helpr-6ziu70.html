                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When considering the types of users that might need help through self-service apps, we recognized a need in those that might have tremors or touch-screen difficulties such as those with Parkinsons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    helpr is a tactile device that can be customized to the user based on need that can relay information to an app through a joystick. helpr allows users to move a joystick in a quadrant to navigate an app instead of buttons on a touchscreen. A special application can be designed with levels to navigate self-help apps such as banking apps.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        The Hardware
                    </strong>
                    Using a pair of potentiometers we are able to track joystick movement in the xy plane. In addition to this, 3 switches are also used for tactile inputs into the app. The user interaction with the inputs is passed to an ATMEGA 328, processed, and passed over bluetooth directly into the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        The Software
                    </strong>
                    Android app built on Android Studio. Connects to bluetooth arduino device on home page. It takes a string of inputs based on joystick location and button click on joystick. Takes user to new page based on location and click combined.

                        Data Transmitting
                    </strong>
                    We had difficulty passing data from the hardware to software in a format that was easy to parse in addition to data transmission speeds. Passing too much data couldn't be handled in real time.

                        Learning to Make an App
                    </strong>
                    Sometimes a plethora of tutorials available make it hard to find the information we need. Forming questions after learning a new skill is always a challenge.

                    </strong>
                    We learned how to put images in an app and them promptly decided we didn't want to put images in the app.
