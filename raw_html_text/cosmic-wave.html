                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am really passionate about bringing data connectivity to people that live in areas where data infrastructure is non existent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Call a number and it describes it to you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For Twilio, there was no way to play a sound or record while on call. So what we had to do was create a conversation and then have another twilio number inject itself into the conference and play a sound if necessary and record what is going on every 10 seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had to create a whole architecture around playing sounds and recording while still on a Twilio call using a different phone in conference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was probably the most complicated thing I have worked on and I'm really glad we got it to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linear Algebra is super useful in computer science! I am pretty much an expert at the Twilio API now. How fast fourier transforms work. How Hamming codes work!
