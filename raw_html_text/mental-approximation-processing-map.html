                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While interning as a trader, I faced a lot of trouble in handling my emotions, especially whenever I lost money. Even in our daily lives, many of us may have issues dealing with our emotions, working out the ethics of our decisions, and bridging relationships. It then occurred to me that these kind of issues would be even worse for those who are mentally-challenged, and have to deal with people who do not understand them very well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users set a goal for themselves to alter their behaviour however they wish, and the platform tries to do that by analyzing their mental state using four key components, informing users regularly of their status, and eventually will aid to self-regulate the content they consume.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The four components to form the compound Mental Approximation Processing function are: emotional management, ethical decision-making, work performance, and relationship management. Since ethical decision-making and relationship management have none or little machine learning ideas or implementations, I designed and built from scratch an ethics analysis tool using my custom Ethics Engine. Then I built the assumptions needed to construct a decent framework for the Relational Analysis tool. Afterwards, I essentially coded a dashboard to track each component and their compound score through candlestick charts. To mimic the information flow and communication, I built a chatbot to demonstrate not only the backend, but also how users will set targets for themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very hard for me to make a trading platform to mimic the buy and sell functions needed to set target for users; however, I resolved this by realizing most users probably would find chatbot a more user-friendly approach to goal setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since my teammates could not make it this weekend, I had to brainstorm, code and present the idea all on my own. It was a cool experience :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mental Approximation Processing (MAP)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to further improve the relational analysis tool, and also integrate the system with a bluetooth receiver. Eventually my system would be like the backend of an "auditory Google Glass".
