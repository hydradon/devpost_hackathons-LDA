                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a fun way to teach children math skills but also keep it entertaining. We thought along the lines of a recently popular game "Snake Hit Block." We wanted to keep it simple and understandable so people could focus more on their math skills than the game play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quick Math! is a fairly simple game where the user can control a block using the arrow keys and maneuver their way to answers to beginner math problems. The player has the chance to earn up to 25 points as they move down the bridge and attempt to quickly answer the questions they are shown. It is a great way to learn from games and is a great form of edutainment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Quick Math! using Unity in C#. This was our first time using Unity and our first time programming in C#, so we had to spend a bit of time learning the basics of the language and later specific things we could apply to our game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was definitely not knowing C#. We were really excited to get to try Unity and more excited to get to apply our knowledge in JavaScript. We were dumbfound when we came across C# instead of JavaScript like we had expected. Nevertheless, we persisted through the night and took some time to gain basic understanding of variables, UI's, random number generator, and so on. 
 Another big problem we had to face was Unity's failure to run a random number generator. Our game was somewhat dependent on random values for math problems so we found ourselves at a loss without it. After hours of trying different ways to pull random numbers, we decided we just had to hard code it. So we made what we had work and still came out with a playable game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the idea we came up with even though we were unable to create exactly what we had planned. We are also very proud of what we were able to complete from our idea without knowing the language we were programming in prior to beginning the game. We are especially proud of our ability to pick up the new languages and programs so easily. Through one night we were able to create a project in an unfamiliar engine and language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quick Math!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to complete the full thought we had for this project. We still have some minor tweaks we want to add as well as some major aspects we need to fix and incorporate. We need to fix the randomizer so we can have the equation and answers display at the degree we had imagined. We would also like to add other operations so people can learn basics of dividing, addition, and subtraction.
