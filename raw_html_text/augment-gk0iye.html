                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was derived from dreams of physically accessing what has been stored within the virtual worlds. We wanted for the user to be able to "feel" the software as if it wasn't just some random code running inside but rather something more tangible. We also wanted for this "code" to be useful in daily life, such as analyzing daily life objects, especially food, and getting the nutritional facts from the food. This will help the users better understand what they are eating and make better choices and we made a companion web app to track the cumulative food eaten by that user.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will be using a projector along with an intricate system involving the iPhone, which allows the projector to display the screen of the iPhone. This will be displaying all the information sensed and analyzed by the hack which is being viewed on the iPhone screen. We are also utilizing a Myo for the hand motions which will control the iPhone screen which is being displayed by the projector so we don't need to hands on use the iPhone. The Myo will detect hand motions which will control our main iOS app and one of the main components of this hack, Augment. This native iOS app allows for the recognition and details about everyday items, ranging from a table, to a man's hand or face, to a sprite can. For food, nutritional details will also be given which will help the user analyze his daily meals. This app will be placed inside our main hardware container which will allow for the iPhone to detect whatever food or object that the user is trying to find out more about. All of this data will be stored on our web app, which runs meteor, and can be accessed by the user with his/her respective account. Another feature of the Augment iOS app is the ability to simply motion a gesture and take a picture wherever you are looking at, without the need to actually take out your phone and swipe up and then take the picture.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build the hardware component of our Augment hack, we used cardboard which helped support our system which helped reflect the iPhone screen through the projector out onto any surface. We were able to get our hands on a pico projector which helped us in accomplishing this task. Afterwards, we integrated the Myo within our hack which allowed us to control the hack without actually touching the iPhone. This included our gestures which can be used to access certain features of our hack, like the Fist is to use the camera while a spread out hand is to access the "recognize food/object and respective details". For the recognition, we were able to implement MongoDB for the collection of various foods, nutritional facts, and for the graphing of the data gathered (the nutritional facts of the foods eaten by the user) via Nutritionix API. The overall detection was done via CloudSight API with OpenCV and we utilized Firebase for storage of images.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into numerous challenges but the biggest hurdle was the object detection. However, this issue grew bigger when we had to incorporate this with our hardware and gestures. We were able to get through these hurdles by reading numerous documentations and blogs about optimizing a object recognition API along with perfecting the OpenCV and motion gestures which were recognized by the Myo.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to interact with the nutriontix API. Addtionally, we learned about CloudSight's API and its model of deep learning to produce accuate results of a given picture. Lastly, we learned about the Myo wristband, and how it meshes with iOS with a given hand gesture. Addtionally, we learned how to project a iphone in a efficent realtime manner. We also learned the interaction of mongo collections to produce graphs with d3js
