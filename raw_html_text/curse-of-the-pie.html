                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believed this was a small but powerful tool in the struggle against online web harassment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension replaces all instances of profanity with a kinder alternative, or simply the word "pie".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote the basic logic in JavaScript and integrated it into Chrome's JSON file format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not know how to make Chrome Extensions or had worked with JSON before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished our first Chrome Extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first experience in using JSON, as well as using JavaScript to modify large parts of the web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Curse of the Pie
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we can have users add to the dictionary of words to censor, as well as add a notification for when words are censored, along with a counter of the number or words censored.
