                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We relate to the Fannie Mae Game Challenge since we are familiar with the financial tools and realized how important it is to learn them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a mobile game where it takes the user through a financial lifetime where they can make financial decisions, starting from the beginning of high school to retirement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We planned for five hours and made sure that the data flow was able to meet the demands of the game. Then we began to implement on Godot for the remaining hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have encountered issues we have never experienced such as learning how to make a global class for the entire app to allow for scene switches, trying to figure out how we can access the data to where we need it, and persisting through the long, cold night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to implement a number of features that we have never believed it was possible including subscription fees, switching scenes, and trying to export to .apk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that planning really helps in the long run and we have spent less time on debugging than any other project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CashFlow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CashFlow could use a graphical update along with some UML diagrams so we can remember what is going on. Once that is done, then we can focus on the next features like establishing credit cards and opportunity events.
