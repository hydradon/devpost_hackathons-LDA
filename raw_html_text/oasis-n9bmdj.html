                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up, I was fortunate to have an aunt who was a nutritionist. I learned from her so many way to eat healthier and I think it has increase my quality of life substantially. It also made me realize, how especially in minority communities, there seems to be less health consciousness about what we consume. This tends to create a feedback loop where healthier food options no longer establish in this types of communities. These create food deserts which lead to additional problems such as widespread obesity and additional health issues.
