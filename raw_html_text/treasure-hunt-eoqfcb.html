                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really enjoyed the talk given by Vidinoti-LCAV and found AR to be an incredibly interesting aspect of technology to explore, especially since we wouldn't regularly get the resources to create such a platform. Also, we like games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Augmented Reality Treasure Hunt where users search for hidden messages by following a trail of clues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the demo given by Vidinoti-LCAV as the base of our AR component, but developed the basis of the app on Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Internet connection and running Android Studio. Combining files and using GPS-based programs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We accomplished the minimum goals we set for ourselves, primarily having the app work to a satisfactory level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use and code in Android Studio and AR. Basically went from 0 to 100 real quick.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Treasure Hunt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed it so that it could be scalable and flexible, meaning we could implement in any other circumstance, such as for a museum tour to replace audio tours. Also wish to implement a community-driven treasure hunt creation so that users feel more immersed and app is customizable.
