                    Hey so this was our first hackathon, and we didn't know anything about creating webapps at all. Despite these limitations, we attempted to create something presentable anyways. Josh tackled the hosting through Heroku, and tried using Node and Express for the first time, while Hannah and Michael developed a user-friendly front-end webpage, trying out new things with html and css. This project is still a work in progress, and will continue to develop as we gain more skills with related frameworks and languages. We hope to one day deliver a useable and robust interface to achieve our end goals. These include incorporating payments and accounts, so that students can benefit from helping each other through our service.
