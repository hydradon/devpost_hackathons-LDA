                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love flying and looking outside the window, but we never know which side to pick
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gathers gps coordinates of the same flight but on previous days, creates a mean flight path, finds out where points of interests are relative to the airplane and answers the question: which side to sit?
                </p>
