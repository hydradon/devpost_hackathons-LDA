                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all know someone who claims to be the best at a particular board game, whether that be Monopoly, Settlers of Catan or simply Connect 4. Furthermore, as board games is a growing market, it can sometimes be tough to find others who enjoy the same games you do. This inspired us to develop Gamelo, a social platform where your skill (or luck) is verified through an Elo system and you can easily meet and find others who enjoy board games as much as you do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gamelo allows its users to join or host tables, which represent events where the users come together to play their favourite games. Users can search and filter the table events around them and request to join those they're interested in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Profile pages include two major sections: game summary and game history. Game summary depicts the players statistics, including their most played games and their ELO for these games.
