                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All too often my family and friends get in the car to go eat, but can't agree on a place to go. We always end up fighting, and no one is happy in the end. Enter Random Restaurant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Random Restaurant makes it easy to decide on a place to eat. You simply ask for a type of food and/or a price range, and Amazon's Alexa will give you a recommendation that is nearby and currently open.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Alexa node.js skills SDK and AWS Lambda to power the voice interface, along with the Yelp API to find restaurants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Still being somewhat new, the Alexa SDK still has a few bugs. Fortunately, we were able to find them and patch them up to work well with our hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got an early version of our skill added to the Alexa skill store! Go enable it on your devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton about how Alexa skills communicate with code on the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Random Restaurant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to keep adding features to Random Restaurant, making it better and better.
