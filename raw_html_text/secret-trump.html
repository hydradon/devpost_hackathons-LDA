                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Secret Trump is designed to be a personification of all the issues currently being felt in the current American political cycle. It is a direct reflection of the chaos, insincerity, and apathy many people currently have with the established. It is all these things compressed into a fun mafia'esque' game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows players to step into the shoes of their political rival or ally and attempt to take over Congress either through electing policies or by killing the main protagonist, Trump. The game can be played currently in two ways. Either as the traditional board game as first envisioned or as an online app on the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The board game is based on the original game Secret Hitler. The board game was designed from scratch but based on the gameplay and layout of the original game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The web version is based on code provided under the creative commons licence. The assets and text of the game were modified in order to fit in better with the theme of the redesigned game. This was done in a way to still allow online play with those playing with the Secret Hitler version.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website which hosts everything was created with Wordpress with custom code and a theme.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS was a service that was incredibly difficult to get my head around. A lot of my time was spent doing research on how to solve problems constantly popping up. I also found it a challenge trying to reverse engineer the code for the online game without breaking the source code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to eventually do both were perhaps my biggest accomplishments. Having the site successfully hosted and being able to create the reworked online app were huge achievements in themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The beginnings on how to utilise AWS in terms of hosting and launching an application. I learned the importance of coming back to a problem if I can't initially find a solution to the problem. I also learned just how complex it can be to launch an efficient application or website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Secret Trump
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refining the site and working further on developing the money mechanism will be needed for future development. As well as this, I'm planning to do heavy promotion on places such as reddit as we get closer and closer towards the American elections. Contacting media outlets around the time would also be a tactic I would used to build further traction
