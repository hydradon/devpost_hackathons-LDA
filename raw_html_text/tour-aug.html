                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build the most portable and accessible device for augmented reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application uses location services to detect where you are located and if you are in proximity to one of the landmark features based on a predefined set of coordinates. Then a 3d notification message appears with the name and information of the location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built on a stack with Objective-C, OpenGL,  NodeJS, MongoDB, and Express using XCode. We also did the 3d modelling in Blender to create floating structures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Math is hard. Real real hard. Dealing with 3D space, there were a lot of natural challenges dealing with calculations of matrices and quaternions. It was also difficult to calibrate for the scaling between the camera feed calculated in arbitrary units and the real world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a functional 3-D augmented reality viewer complete with parallax effects and nifty animations. We think that's pretty cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really honed our skills in developing within the 3-D space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tour Aug
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possible uses could include location-based advertising and the inclusion of animated 3d characters.
