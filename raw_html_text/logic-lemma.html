                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create an educational game that could help others learn in one way or another.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Logic Lemma is a game which tests your logic gate reading skills. A sequence of logic gates are randomly generated, and you must determine whether or not the last gate outputs true or false by either pressing the T or F key. For each successive correct answer, the maximum time limit decreases slightly, forcing you to answer faster or lose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was programmed in c++ and uses the SFML library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time I used the SFML library, and had to learn it on the go. Also, testing to see whether or not my output for the logic gate sequence was correct was rather time consuming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was gratifying to use concepts I've learned in recently taken classes and put them into practice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am much more familiar with the SFML library than previously, and learned that making games look aesthetically pleasing is very difficult.
