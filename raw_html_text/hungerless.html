                    In NYC, most homeless people have dumb phones provided by government programs, but online connectivity is limited on the streets.

                    Hungerless connects people in need with the people who are willing to help. A homeless person can text a number and it will log their name and location. When a food donor has food available, they can fill out a simple form.

                    Hungerless will match them and set up a meeting location that is public and safe (such as CVS, Starbucks, etc) and they can meet outside. The homeless person will be able to have a meal that would otherwise had gone to waste.
