                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you come to SF, the first thing you run into is garbage bins. Well, we&rsquo;ve been here for a year. And we&rsquo;re still stuck trying to guess which stuff goes where.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The camera identifies the product category and opens the right bin. Also, if you sync the system with Amazon Alexa, you will be able to re-order the things you&rsquo;ve just wasted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used iOS app and iPad camera for motion detection and capturing the pictures of garbage. 
We trained visual recognition on IBM Watson to categorize garbage items. 
We used Arduino and three Servo for opening trash cans. 
Amazon Alexa helps us build our restock list with the grocery items we run out of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we had huge problems programming the garbage bins to open automatically with the help of Servo Motors. Second, it was no easy task to capture the exact moment the garbage item gets in front of the iPad camera. And third, we had to create quite a big data base to train the IBM Watson neural network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to build the whole mechanism just with materials at hand. Glue gun works wonders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt to unite a few APIs, such as Amazon Alexa and IBM Watson.
