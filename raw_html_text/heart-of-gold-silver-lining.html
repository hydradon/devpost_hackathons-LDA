                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Born out of necessity.  Divorce, trauma, and modern family structures make it almost impossible for families to save in traditional standpoints.  Traditional government aide fails to address the value of wellness, whole family, and education.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Easy smart contracts to create a record of the relationship.  Creates a non-fungible &lt;3 for each family, general &lt;3 tokens can be given to families.  Hearts can be broken, ending the smart contract and removing breaking party as wallet owner.  Families may post the link to their wallets to receive aide.  Funds are monitored by central custodian, only approved expenditures can the &lt;3s be used for.
                </p>

                    I'm not a developer!

                <p>
                    I spent all night last night throwing up with a fever and the chills yet I still managed to put a project up by the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That even though I am non-technical, the vision and application I have for blockchain technology is valid.

                <p>
                    I'll take it home and show my daughter that I didn't come here for nothing.   I will keep the idea alive and hopefully someday will be teamed with a dev that I can make something functional to show the VCs back home.
