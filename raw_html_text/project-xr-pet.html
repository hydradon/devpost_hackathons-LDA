Everyone shares moments on Instagram and Facebook by having fun utilizing features such as filters. We wanted users to have their own pets in a virtual space on the go and when they are home. Social media has a way for allowing introverts to be themselves and interact with others by connecting through having virtual pets.

If the user lifts their eyebrows the pet will wiggle side to side. If the user opens their mouth food will appear and the pet will respond by moving towards the user's mouth. With in Oculus the user can pet, feed and play with the pet (Dragon)
