                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sudden cardiac death is a condition that can affect many young people, especially the fit, young and relatively health. There are some ways to screen for it with various kinds of imaging such as ultrasound, CT scan or an MRI scan. However it is important to know which people to screen. This app helps us to detect key symptoms early on and analyse patterns that match diseases.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an iOS app with a Python/Flask backend that receives input from the user of various symptoms including light-headedness, breathlessness or palpitations - especially during diseases. It records various metrics such as length of symptoms and heart rate which is then sent to the server. This information is then presented as a graph back to the user and also flagged to the doctor if the symptoms are deemed sufficiently urgent in presentation.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this app with an iOS front end and a Python/Flask backend. Graph creation was performed with d3.js
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Incorporating d3.js with my Flask server was difficult
                </p>

                <p>
                    I successfully managed to get multiple users monitored with a single Flask instance
                </p>
