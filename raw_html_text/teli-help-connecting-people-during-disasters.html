                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On 30th Nov. 2015 Chennai was hit by a massive flood which left thousands of people stranded. The rescue operator were helpless as these floods had brought down the telephone towers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prototype for this hachathon helps in connecting with the relief help groups using LoRa technology. LoRa is a low power technology which has a range of 21 km and can work without the use of any transmitting tower.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The LoRa module was integrated with the Raspberry Pi to communicate with the wireless module. The Raspberry Pi had had WiPi dongle to help connect the android phone (acting as a receiver) to communicate over WiFi. On the transmit-ion end the keyboard was interfaced with the Raspberry Pi to send data in the form on text. Two Raspberry Pi with onboard LoRa module were used (one acting as a receiver and the other as a transmitter)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team had no prior experience with sending/receiving UDP packets using C++. Custom code had to be self written for the hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In such a short period of time the team collectively was able to establish a connection between one user and the other sitting at a distance of 10km across the city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is only 5 percent of the entire project. Implementing it in the correct manner is what makes a difference.
                </p>

                    What's next for Teli-Help : Connecting people during disasters
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on building the portable module which could be integrated with any android phone and send GPS locations with their need. Transforming it into a product and making  a business out of it will be another challenge.
