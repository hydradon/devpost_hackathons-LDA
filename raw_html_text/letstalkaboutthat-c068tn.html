                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw many people, even in our immediate social circle, that would appreciate having an application like this at their disposal in order to improve their mental wellbeing.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows a
                    <em>
                        Talker
                    </em>
                    to connect with a
                    <em>
                        Listener
                    </em>
                    to talk about anything from traumatic events to daily struggles or even just to talk with someone who is there for them.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The graphical elements were constructed using HTML, CSS and BootStrap. The back-end was constructed using a multitude of languages such as PHP, JavaScript, JQuery, MySQL and more.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Handling session ids was a difficult hurdle. Naturally we turned towards a known mentor and friend of ours, Shawn Simon, in order to give us starting knowledge to accomplish our goal. In the end we were also successful! Our server was also made unavailable during the last hours of the event (due to strenuous use). Without a doubt, that hindered our progress significantly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we finally managed to transmit messages through a chat interface using multiple user sessions, we were so ecstatic that everyone hugged. Tears were shed. It was an amazing moment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our friends, Julia, who is majoring in Cognitive Science at McMaster University, assisted in directing our non-functional requirements that would optimize the effectiveness of our application. We also became much more proficient in the languages used as well as performing cohesively as a team.
