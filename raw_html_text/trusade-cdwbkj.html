                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were given large data sets by Finra, the data included info about Brokers who had been banned from stock trading. However we noticed that many become financial advisors. How do we know we can trust them?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rates and determines if a financial advisor is good or bad depending on financial and legal data that well have run through our machine learning model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its with google app engine, its a flask web app that uses Google Cloud Storage as its blob store and big  query to parse the data along with machine learning apis like SCIKIT-Learn and NLP
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the relationship between the data sets provided for the ex-brokers and understand the relationships between the schemas for the court data. In addition, understanding the implementation of the machine learning libraries and the Google Cloud NLP API
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the project, and learning more about machine learning and correlations
                </p>

                    Google Cloud and machine learning techniques.
