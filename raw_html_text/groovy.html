                    What is should do is play along with you in realtime constantly adjusting to whatever you're playing on whatever instrument

                    Challenges we ran into

                    Turns out not many people have accomplished this, so most of our work has been building up theories and researching Music and how to create it.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Music is a very complex form of art which has so many little thing that could change the whole song
