                <p>
                    Our project was to create a web app that would allow users to take a picture of a shopping list and then, using 
Google Cloud vision API, read the shopping list. After the shopping list has been read our program would then 
determine, using an A* pathfinding algorithm, the shortest route through the department store.

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We would like to implement a filter so that items with a temperature requirement 
(hot/cold) would be moved to the end of the shopping list (and thusly, the pathing queue.)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We would like to implement functionality where the pathfinding algorithm would take in account 
(using the loss prevention cameras on every isle) the amount of congestion on the isles and use this 
data during the heuristics weighting.

                        <p>
                            We would like to implement the functionality to where a user can take a picture of their list and using the
store API the app will tell them the estimated price of all their items before they begin shopping.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We would like to implement the functionality to where a user can save their credit card information to the app
and checkout using a one time generated QR code.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We would like to implement the functionality to where the user can request for assistance from store personnel 
directly through the app.
