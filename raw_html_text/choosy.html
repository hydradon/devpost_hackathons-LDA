                    Shorten the time it takes to sort through several/dozens of photos when you only want to share one - the best.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets you select the photos you want to compare, and continually presents you with two of them to choose between, narrowing it down to your best. Then you are given the option to share.
