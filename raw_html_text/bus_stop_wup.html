                    description: awesome application which should be run on a huge touch screen at a bus stop of the future!

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What could we do with a huge screen?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Main functions:
&ndash; show timetable of the transport for the current bus stop;
&mdash; show city map with other bus stops and information about these bus stops;
&mdash; show current time and weather;
&mdash; show advertisement and important news for tourist and locals;
&mdash; provide "stop button", which future passenger has to press to indicate that he needs the closest bus to stop. The provided light show will make sure that you'll never miss a buss ever again, because the bus driver didn't see you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built on Windows Universal Platform. Two WebView elements are used to display data from web pages. The reittiopas.fi service was used to provide information on the local bus stop (with map and transoprt information). Weather data is fetched from
                    <a href="http://openweathermap.org/" rel="nofollow">
                        http://openweathermap.org/
                    </a>
                    and served to the application through an Azure instance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have much experience with web development so in order to be able to create something concrete we ended up creating a native Windows application with web controls.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It does look quite neat!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quit talking and just do it!

                    What's next for your project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As soon as the touch enabled bus stops start popping up we're going to see more and more of our app during the daily commute.
