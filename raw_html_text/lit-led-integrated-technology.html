                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being our first hackathon, we wanted to make something simple but impactful. Being University students who enjoy music we got the idea of revamping our experiences in our dorm rooms. So we came up with LIT, that visualizes audio with great detail.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LIT as the name suggest is a music visualizer that syncs in real time. The system is connected to a music emitting device that records the frequency and visualizes it via LED lights on the circuit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LIT was created using Arduino and Electric circuitry. Utilizing LED lights, breadboard, resistors and arduino Uno the system visualizes any audio that is sent through the auxiliary cable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major challenge was finding the right pieces for the circuit. Due to unavailability of some parts such as a potentiometer, we had to adapt. In addition finding an ideal sensitivity range for the LED lights to react to the frequency was a little difficult without some key parts but using trial testing we were able to find the a suitable frequency range.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first hackathon for three of the four members on this team. All being in their first year of their undergraduate careers. We are proud that we were able to accomplish a finished project that not only executes but is super COOL!
