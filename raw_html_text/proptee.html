                    The whole story:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a time not too long ago when we were all sold on the idea of being home-owners but found daunting the long process and high requirements that this involved. As university students, we had trouble investing into commercial buy-to-let properties since the finances of mortgages and deposits are extremely steep for low net-worth individuals. Even so, we didn't let this setback stop us, thus creating Proptee. We are a startup that enables anybody to enter the property market with as little as they want, and benefit from the growth and revenue that it generates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we run into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a stock market for properties is a complex problem. Half of the team didn&rsquo;t have any android experience, so the biggest challenge we faced was to get everyone&rsquo;s environment up and running.
Implementing and customising the MPAndroidChart was another challenge for us, as it is using real-time data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a working prototype in 24h. Both the business and the technological side of the product was covered in this time and we are ready to pitch the idea to investors.
We are proud of the great teamwork and spirit we had and that we were able to overcome any challenges together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How much can be done in 24h, once the team is organised and willing to work together tirelessly.
