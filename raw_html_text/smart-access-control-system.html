                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most people may have experienced that standing at the front door finding the door key for a long time. We make this facial detection door to let you get into your house easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Detect if the face is the house's owner and let the owner get into the house and send the alarm if a dangerous person is detected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build with the flask to set connect between the alarm system (raspberry pi) and the camera and processing system (Mac). Use opencv and keras to train and predict human's face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Poor network connection makes data transmission very slow.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build a facial detection powered by CNN.
