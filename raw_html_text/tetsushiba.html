                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a website that would provide something to smile about to anyone and everyone. I think that a lot of our smiles come from small things, and this website would be able to give that to its visitors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has links to videos, quotes, photos and memes that I found funny, and wanted to share with others. Depending on how the user feels, they can select what they want to see and how much of it that they want to see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a simple website using HTML, then added some animation features to it with CSS and Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was my first hackathon, I was very inexperienced with creating something with code from scratch. However, with the help of online resources and friends, I was somehow able to solidify a complete website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Something that I am definitely proud of accomplishing during this hackathon would be my ability to teach myself something completely new, and simultaneously apply it to a creation that I had in mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I am much more suited to do fore-end coding, rather than the complex back-end work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for tetsushiba
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the next hackathon that I participate in, I hope to practice some more back-end coding for perhaps an app. I would love to work on designing the aesthetics and user interactive animations on an app, instead of focusing on a website.
