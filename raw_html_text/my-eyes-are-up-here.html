                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever sat in a boring telepresence meeting?
Or worse have you had to watch a recorded one?
Wished you could skip to the important part?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does it do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By tracking the audience's head orientation throughout the meeting/presentation we can plot their attention over time.
All the while it transcribes the speech, extracts the main talking point per 30s, and associate the keyword to the attentiveness score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the backend, Python code runs the API calls to Azure Vision
With javascript, we record the audio and transcribe it
Finally, we plot the data in Chart.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team suffered from decamping by 50% of the members
Attention is not a parameter supported by any vision api we could find but the head tilt does a pretty good job
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
