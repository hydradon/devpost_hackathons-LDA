                <p>
                    As college students, we realize the challenge an interview can present and wanted to help other students prep for the upcoming interviews and first impressions ahead of them.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    InterviewMe is both an AlexaSkill and Andriod app.
It runs through 4 different types of mock interviews both verbally and in text format. In addition to feedback through the full interview, our project also provides tips and tricks and individual practice questions.
