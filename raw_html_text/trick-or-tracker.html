                    Growing up with a severe nut allergy made most Halloweens growing up quite disappointing. The goal of treatortracker is to ensure that children of all ages can trick or treat for candy that is safe for them to eat, the app is a dynamic, real-time Halloween map that highlights allergen-free homes based on the user's input. Individuals who choose to stay at home on Halloween night may also opt to mark their homes as "premium" houses, indicating that there are full-size candies bars to be had. Each house on the block will be rated on a scale of 1-5 and have allergen information readily available to ensure that everyone has the best Halloween experience possible.
