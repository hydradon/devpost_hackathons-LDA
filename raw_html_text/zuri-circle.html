                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to current iOS and Swift SDK releases, there are several third-party frameworks that haven't updated their projects for which, the custom UI components had to be created manually along with the network managers.
There were a lot of features that was provided in the MVP, This took extra effort from our side as we developed this in under a day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MVP was built keeping in mind the most required features for the NPO like managing volunteers, sending out mails about registration. Information about every event added to all volunteers and accepting confirmation. The payment application on iOs bring convenience to the finger tips of the donors. The NPO wanted receipt generation for donors to help them with their tax filings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about a NPO mindsets and a way in which we can create effective solutions for them. This also gives us an overview of the requirements people might have , where we can possibly extend the same solution to multiple NGOs.
                </p>

                    What's next for Zuri Circle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MVP will be used as the base for a better application, The PDFs and email have to be set right templates and payment integration and application whitelisting by Paypal to enable real payments. The NPO has to provide aws subscription and domain for application hosting.
