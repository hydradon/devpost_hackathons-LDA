                    Inspiration: A large and aging population will generate high demand for quality health care that is also efficient. To meet this demand we think wearable health sensors that provide remote tracking is a huge area of opportunity for development.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Currently our device is able to take EMG data generated from a Myoware sensor, cache it until a given time, and finally send it over NB-IoT to a react frontend that records and graphs the data.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: Programming the Arduino powered NB board, we used C to poll the EMG sensor. After a specified amount of time passed we used the SIM card provided to send the data Twilio. From there we linked it to our react frontend through an Ngrok tunnel to graph the data.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Our original goal was to provide several sensors for different health data. Unfortunately we were unable to find any sensors that were compatible with the Arduino chipset we were working with. The only sensor we were able to successfully connect with on a consistent basis was the EMG sensor.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: The technology we worked with was brand new to everyone in the team. Coming up with an effective method to track the fairly large amount of data required to capture EMG sensor data was a difficult process. We decided that specialized sensors like the EMG were vital but could be used sparingly by a trained caregiver. This means that while there will be times of high data generation we can control this and use these sensors sparingly.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned about the difficulty of trying to take a product from the idea stage all the way through deliverable. It was a great experience overall.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Remote Health Monitoring and Wearable Technology: The next step for this project is to add more sensors to the system. Sensors include EKG, EEG, glucose monitoring, temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate. Several of these sensors use less data which would allow us to take better advantage of the NB-IoT technology.
