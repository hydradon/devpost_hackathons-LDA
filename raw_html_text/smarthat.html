                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While in New York this summer, we found it hard to keep track of where we were going and taking pictures of the monuments. Constantly switching between Maps and Camera, we thought that there had to be a better way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The hat takes pictures at the press of a button and then sends them to you. Two LEDs on the front of the cap also indicate which direction you should travel, in order to arrive at your destination. To choose your destination you message our chatbot name HatBot.
