                        Inspiration:

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created this prototype interface to allow customers the opportunity of doing volunteer work alongside their vacation planning, either in conjunction with, or instead of a vacation. The inspiration for this is behind the need for volunteers worldwide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    <strong>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The volunteering organizations partner with JetBlue to show their events on their website.  In return, JetBlue provides bonus miles, incentives or even discounts to the customer, as part of their social responsibility mission while giving exposure to the various programs.  JetBlue wins customers, customers win a life-changing experience, and the world wins support!
                </p>

                    </strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using Ruby on Rails, scraping with Nokogiri and formatting with Bootstrap.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scraping! We tried to scrape an international volunteering website to gather opportunities to then be displayed to the customers, using branded JetBlue layouts. We came across an issue with the actual scraping; the site only allowed us to take the first object, rather than all of the listings. Definitely something to improve later!
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're SO proud of our innovative idea, adding value to both the company's goals and helping make the world a better place.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of creating solid structures and models figured at the beginning of the process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We'd like to add more features to expand into more geographies. We'd also like to add more functionality creating a more seamless UX, providing better flow between the booking process and selecting volunteering opportunities.
