                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Social and mental insecurity is rampant in today's society and we aim to carefully assist in improving mass self-confidence and reducing unnecessary worry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can upload photos of clothes, linkedin pictures, or really anything they are unsure about and the system will collect anonymous, simple, and positive feedback from other users. There are absolutely no "negative" rating but rather a "either-or" system that allows us to support mental confidence without bringing people down. End users will see their "top performers" without any statistics that could cause worry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hosting a web server with react, redux, and firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase, especially when combined with react/redux can be an over-complicated pain at times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing! It was a close call for a a couple hours. And of course, to have created something that we believe will help society.
