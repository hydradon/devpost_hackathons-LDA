                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A common problem we found at our school was students having their work copied or their privacy invaded without their knowledge due to wandering eyes landing on their Computer. We set out to solve this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Silent Fence alerts the user when multiple faces are staring at their screen. It also allows the user to configure the program so that certain recognized faces are permitted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the project by integrating existing facial detection libraries and combining them with facial recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Installing the libraries and getting them to work properly on our different operating systems proved very challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how we configured the program to not only detect multiple faces and display a user-customizable warning but to allow for certain faces to be permitted as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to work with opencv and use existing facial recognition libraries.
                </p>

                    What's next for Silent Fence
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Silent Fence could have many applications and we would like to configure it for mobile screens as well.
