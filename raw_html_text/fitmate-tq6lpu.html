                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be honest, we're not the healthiest people. Also, compared to our other idea, WebMD VR, FitMate didn't sound too bad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile application allows users to meet people around them and find a workout buddy! Our system matches users based on their location, and their workout preferences. Workout buddies can chat with each other and stay up-to-date on each other's progress.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode, Swift, and Fire Base to build our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are first time hackers, we struggled with source control, creating a database, and learning the development process of a mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are definitely proud about building a functional mobile application using new technology in only 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to write code in Swift and use Xcode. We also learned how to use Fire Base for our application, which was very cool!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FitMate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to implement other features that we did not have enough time to do such as machine learning to suggest better routines for workout buddies!
