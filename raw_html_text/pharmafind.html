                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by SkyScanner's search engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user enters a medication and the engine gives results of the pharmacies that have this medication in stock and showing them in an order from the nearest to the furthest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split the team up into four roles: One would deal with the HTML part of the engine; one would deal with the styling of the markup language, CSS; one would deal with PHP, the functional part of the engine; and the other would make the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew what we were doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned completely new languages and made a prototype of a search engine from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New languages. How to code in a team. How valuable teamwork is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PharmaFind
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to develop PharmaFind even more as it seems to us like a very promising project. For example, if we had an actual database of pharmacies and their medication, access to a map, etc., the engine would give real-world results, that would help people who are in need of certain medication, but have trouble finding it and waste time to look for it.
