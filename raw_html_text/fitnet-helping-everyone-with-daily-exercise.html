                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile devices with 802.11ac gigabit wifi establish connectivity with cloud and peer resources.  Device integrations via bluetooth enable local ingestion of real-time biometric data.   Computer vision technology provides real-time feedback to the client and trainer about the activity.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried using the Apple Multi-peer connectivity library as a peer-to-peer discover and data sharing framework but ran into many challenges, so had to shift gears.   The team learned a new programming language, Swift, in the process which slowed number of features we could put into the hack this weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Live interactive fitness is very engaging and we cant wait to turn this hack into production.
                    <br>
                    Implemented a peer-to-peer video streaming service in 24 hours.
                    <br>
                    Integrated with plantronics headset for additional biometric feedback.
                    <br>
                    Learned a new programming language.
                    <br>
                    We had a lot of fun in SF working on this experimental version of our app.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Be careful of beta frameworks, you can lose a lot of time.   Check online forums about a new framework before using it to see how the community is responding.
                    <br>
                    There are a wealth of compatible devices which can add to the a virtual fitness experience. It is an exciting time.
                    <br>
                    Cloud GPU resources are now available which is very cool.
                    <br>
                    Swift programming language is powerful and not too hard to learn
