                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Wendy works as a teacher at high school we learned about the Hackaton and thought of some ideas but it was a bit late to develop a fully flavoured and exciting skill but we still wanted to play with it to learn more and get inspired for the future
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the basic quiz example as a code base to render a quiz that is specific about Italy and information related to its regions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of the information we wanted to delivered and we limited to the minimum essential to render a useful experience for kids. Diego focused on learning the basic the of the voice interface and copied and modified the lambda sample to render a custom quiz with information provided and extracted from official reference books
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to run a more complex and multi language solution but it looks like Alexa is not ready for it yet. So we limited the demo to something that resembles a quiz that could be interacted with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A basic demo and understanding of the platform is now much greater. We also now know about the possibilities that Alexa provides and we are going to keep an eye on it to eventually build a new skill as soon as more languages are included
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That there is a totally different market out there created by these new voice enabled devices that could be used to source and develop new businesses. Also technically learned about Alexa, Lambda and how its interface and interaction can be built together.
