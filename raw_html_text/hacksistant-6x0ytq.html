                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At every Hackathon, hackers wonder what to create. Should I make an app or a website? What prize category should I go for? Introducing:
                    <em>
                        Hacksistant
                    </em>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hacksistant is the perfect tool to help hackers ideate, develop, and publish their hack. Hacksistant is designed to be the perfect tool to assist hackers, new and veteran, in developing a great hack at any hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used
                    <strong>
                        Google Assistant
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Google Dialogflow
                    </strong>
                    to create a chatbot for the user to converse with. The user interacts with the chatbot and answers a few questions. Based on the responses, we created
                    <strong>
                        JSON
                    </strong>
                    objects representing that data. These JSON objects were stored in a
                    <strong>
                        Firebase
                    </strong>
                    database and then passed to an algorithm to match a Hack with the user. The algorithm took into account the user's skillset, goals etc. We used
                    <strong>
                        Keras
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        machine learning
                    </strong>
                    to train the algorithm to be more accurate, ensuring each suggested Hack was representative of what the user can do and want to do. Finally, Hacksistant was hosted on an
                    <strong>
                        HTML
                    </strong>
                    website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting and synchronizing the data from the dialogflow with the matching algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are particularly proud of creating something that we could use in the future. As returning hackers, we are always stumped over what to create.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hacksistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could always increase the accuracy by continually increasing the training time with the algorithm. In addition, Hacksistant could be made to accept a larger dataset of information from the user to better match the user with a hack.
