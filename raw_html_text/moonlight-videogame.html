                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Old school platformer with a twist.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It entertains the player. The main mechanic of our game is throwing a ball and catching it to progress the level, ultimate frisbee style. Dropping the ball causes the player to reset to wherever they were before throwing the ball.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    This was our first time using unity and our first game. We did not have much time to figure out what we were doing which lead to complications.
