                    Education is unavoidable part of life, but the benefits usually come much later, only after (or if) you finish it, and it might take months, sometimes years. Even if you add mentors and exams on the platform &ndash; it improves the course, not the person and can easily be avoided if the student is a procrastinator with experience.
                </p>
