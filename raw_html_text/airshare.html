                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came about a year ago when I had to do some brainstorming for a senior project. Because of some legal technicalities, my professor recommended I did not work on this project. However, for a while this project has been in my mind.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AirShare connects you to flyers anywhere in the world making sending and recieving packages faster than ever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split into two groups, primarily because it made it easier for us to work in small subset groups. Miguel and I worked together and Wendy and Josh worked together. We did not have previous knowledge of html so we used an online template to put together the general outline of the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us have only taken introductory courses to computer science so our previous knowledge was very limited. Unfortunately most of our time was spent learning different basic concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of how much we learned!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use GitHub, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AirShare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we delve deeper into the CS field we hope that we can make a more technical version of the AirShare Webb App.
