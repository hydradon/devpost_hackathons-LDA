                    A simple bubble popping game made in Unity with a dual purpose: to provide a calming experience for gamers on the autism spectrum and a chance to learn to make simple games with Unity and get an introduction to game development.

                    We hope to distrubute our game on Android and iOS, with working table and web versions if time allows.
                    <strong>
                        Minimum viable product
                    </strong>
                    : a simple tapping mechanic that destroys objects. To support such functionaly we implement the following basic parts:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A reusable bubble component.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A bubble spawner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tapping.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>
                    Experience
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Ideally, playing our game should be a calming, repetitive experience, perhaps in the vein of some "not-games" like
                    <em>
                        Venture Capitalist
                    </em>
                    , but without leveling mechanics that may cause stress.

                <p>
                    After implementing the minimum viable product we hope to complete some feature passes to add polish to the experience.
