                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year &mdash; approximately 1.3 billion tonnes &mdash; gets lost or wasted. Why not meet up and share the food with each other or cook something from the surplus ingredients, instead of throwing away the food into your bin?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple platform where users can host a brunch event by just sharing their 'leftovers' or by hosting a random bash by bringing the ingredients from them fridge and cook something together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back-end REST API has been built in node.js which serves as a bridge between our mongoDB and the Angular2 client.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is possible to develop immunity and resistant to caffeine after some time. 
Working with Angular at the first time, found it difficult to debug it properly. It was also challenging to get the responses from the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we can demo anything that would make us more than happy!
In the sake of the demo we use hard coded data instead of calling the API. We go for the noob-prize:)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to cooperate with each other, working together towards a common goal with a group of 4 people from 4 different countries. Sharing the knowledge, by teaching each other.
                </p>

                    What's next for CommunEATy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's just a mock version of it. Might continue as a hobby/side project.
