                    We, the designers of
                    <strong>

                    , are trying to further empower our fellow citizens through increasing their access to and awareness of educational resources in their community. Currently, the information that they could use to empower themselves is scattered and not necessarily easy to access. By bringing the information into a central location, citizens will have more ease of access to it, thereby allowing them the possibility to improve both themselves as well as others who are active in their community. We hope to encourage people towards fuller participation within their community. In short, we are attempting to bridge the gap that exists between members of the general public and the community resources that are available to them.

                    While compiling the resources for this project, it became evident that the information regarding public events held at universities is not simply accessed.  The degree accessibility to the resources varied greatly amongst the different institutions we attempted to gather information from. In addition, many universities had no means of supplying this data through RSS or XML feeds.  These findings support our hypothesis that there is a need to collect and sort the information in an easy to navigate application to provide the community with access to these events.
