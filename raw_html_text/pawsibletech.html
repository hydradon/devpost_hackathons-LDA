                    Hello and thank you for your interest in PawsibleTech!  The inspiration and idea for this project came to me as I recently adopted a new family member, our dog Ella (see pic bellow). Ella is a one year old hound dog that has a tendency to take flight whenever the opportunity arrises, this has led to some exhausting and worrisome chases and neighborhood search parties for our runaway dog. We have been lucky to find her each time and have made many fortifications to our backyard fence however being a CIS student I was interested in what technology I could use to help mitigate the issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution we came up with was to utilize a combination of QR code, automated SMS alert messaging and GEO location technologies.  A custom QR code is generated and can be printed onto an id tag, if the pet is then lost or on the lam whoever finds the pet only needs to scan the QR code and upon doing so a text message and Email is sent to the owner with includes the current location on a map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Node.JS back end server interfaces with Mongo for authentication as well as MySQL for all of the structured data and Twilio for sending notifications to the user.  The front end is built in React and is used to interface with the API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were determining the scope of the project and making sure it was feasible for the time frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of what we accomplished in 36 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use new technologies that we have had limited or no previous experience with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue with this project and very soon offer this service to all pet owners across the United States  and continue to develop working technology that will benefit pet owners and their furry friends.
