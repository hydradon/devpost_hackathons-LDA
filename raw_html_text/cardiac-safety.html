                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to make an app for people in emergencies; it links important websites and tries to send an sms to loved ones of the user (would be previously loaded)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    used c9.io and tried to use twilio to send sms (did not work because it didn't integrate)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    twilio didn't integrate with c9 and basically, we didn't do anything
                </p>
