                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As high school students, we have encountered situations in which we are unsure about how our grade will change after a certain assignment. UpGrade solves this problem by calculating the new grade for the user, eliminating the need to do the math themselves. Also, sometimes, students want to know what grade they must get on their next assignment in order to maintain or raise their grade. UpGrade also has a tool that calculates the grade the user needs to get, solving this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UpGrade has two parts: the grade calculators and the math tools. These two topics are separated into different sections of the website. 
Here is the information about each feature:
                </p>
                <h2>
                    New Grade Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The new grade calculator is a tool which students can use to calculate their new grade after a certain assignment. This feature eliminates the need for the user to compute the grueling mathematics required for this task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Desired Grade Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The desired grade calculator allows students to see what score they must get on their next assignment in order to maintain or raise their grade. The user can input their desired grade along with a few other numbers and UpGrade will automatically calculate the necessary grade.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Quadratic Equation Solver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The desired grade calculator allows students to see what score they must get on their next assignment in order to maintain or raise their grade. The user can input their desired grade along with a few other numbers and UpGrade will automatically calculate the necessary grade.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Area and Volume Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The other math resource is the area and volume calculator. It can calculate the area of a rectangle, square, triangle, and circle and the volume of a sphere, cone, cylinder, cube, and rectangular/triangular prism. This feature allows the user to easily calculate these values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to make UpGrade. JavaScript was used to write the programs that calculate the grades and math functions. HTML and CSS were used to design the website and incorporate the JavaScript programs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, we wrote the programs for the grade calculators and the math tools in Java, thinking we could use an applet to insert the Java program into the HTML code. However, we could not find a way to do so
                    <em>
                        after
                    </em>
                    writing the programs, so we had to start over and write the programs in JavaScript. This wasted a few hours of our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though this was our first hackathon, we were able to produce a functioning website that also has a good-looking layout and theme.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The process of developing UpGrade taught us a lot about coding and creating. We learned a substantial amount of JavaScript here via the help of a mentor. Also, we learned about teamwork and filming/editing video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UpGrade
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the near future, we would like to expand the variety of math tools and further improve upon the design of the webpage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The domain in the video is now incorrect. The new domain is: up-grade.tech
This is because we received the .tech domain late.
