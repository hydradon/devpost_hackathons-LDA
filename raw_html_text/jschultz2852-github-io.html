                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had personal experiences with struggling to find lodgings while studying abroad. We thought a tool that would aid students in their search would be beneficial to a lot of people!

                <p>
                    For students looking to study abroad, finding housing accommodations is often one of the hardest parts of planning. Our website consolidates data from a variety of different sources so that you can find information on affordable apartments, university dorms, and homestays all on one website; thus greatly facilitating the planning process.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having no prior experience with web development, we learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We constructed a site using a combination of these. We divided the aspects of the website into functions among the three of us and individually worked on them. We eventually brought the parts together to create a functioning website!

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have experience in Cyber security. Web development was new for us and we had to learn everything from scratch!

                <p>
                    We took a step into the unknown and learned a lot about a new area of the tech field.
                </p>

                    Next time, we would integrate APIs to increase the search functionality and result scale.
