                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I get this Idea when I saw a movie running facial recognition software on security cameras while it was live, I thought that would be a cool Idea to have a drone to send out and search for some certain people that could be dangerous for our society, without risking any police officers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Security Cameras are usually boring to monitor and it takes lots of time to search for the clips of incidents that happen or to find someone it usually takes a lot of time, so I came up with the Idea of a drone fly over a crowd and target only certain people that we are looking for by recognizing their faces.

                <p>
                    I used many programming languages and API's to build this project

                    machine learning is always a challenge to face with.

                    I have the drone running very accurately recognizing faces
