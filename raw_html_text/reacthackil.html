                <p>
                    Makes a minimal beautiful representation of the medical history of a patient and their relatives.
Add relatives to a family tree like UI and see the hereditary illnesses with the highest risk for the current patient.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was mostly done through git and face to face collaboration. We diagrammed on the whiteboard at times.
                    <br>
                    The project itself is comprised of react js, javascript, html, css, and IMO's API.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We were not familiar with the organization of a react.js project

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React.js is really good for prototyping.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    To add more to the project we have a tendency to go towards more familiar javascript frameworks but many people who have used react extensively claim it can be more powerful if the project is organized correctly. Currently it needs database and back end integration. Additional features for growth include: smarter filtering of the highest risk illnesses, a minimal graphing API to visualize the tree without having so many bare branches. Parsing of medical problem jsons to reflect the highest risk illnesses.
