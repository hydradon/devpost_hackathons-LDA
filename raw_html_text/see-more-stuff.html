                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was aiming to do something completely different, but found that I had no idea where to begin, and so I decided to do something without the need for user registration and login
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You enter a city or landmark and have the option of looking up weather information and places to eat around there. I would have added directions as well as points of interest and activities, etc. but ran out of time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple Rails app with Twilio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to differentiate between when a user was typing in a city and when they were requesting the weather or food. So hard, in fact, that I couldn't solve it. I would say the app is about 50% working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd never done a Rails project before, so the fact that I made a thing that kind of does a thing is already pretty satisfying to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am not good at Rails.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for See More Stuff
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll go home and actually attempt to get it working when I can think straight and my leg isn't twitching.
