                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project was making a digital journal that can be accessed from anywhere and that keeps records of past interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, our project loads a user authentication web page. If the credentials the user inputs are not associated with an existing account (key-value pairing), the user will click "create account" and their information will be saved. If the information the user inputs is associated with an existing account, the user will be redirected to a page where they will be able to either create a new post (on a personal journal only visible to them by default) or view their previous posts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this web app journal using HTML, javascript, and CSS. We also utilized Local Web Storage to save user credentials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were stumped by the task of implementing social media integration (if our users wanted to make their journal posts public) as well as the ability to save old posts without them refreshing when the page refreshes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main accomplishment we were proud of was utilizing Local Web Storage to save the user credentials in a way that was easy to access and save.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that a lot of creative ideas can be brought about by collaborating with fellow hackers rather than coding on your own. The ability to bounce ideas off of someone else just as motivated as you is unmatched when it comes to productivity and creativity.
