                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most fun things you can do as a guitar player is play along with a friend.  But a friend is not always available when inspiration strikes.  But Alexa is. And she does not cringe when you hit a wrong note, or drink your beer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using just voice commands Backing Buddy lets you select a backing track to play along with.  No more fiddling with a computer to bring up the track you want.  (With a guitar rested on your lap it is actually a lot more inconvenient than you might think).
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you are ready to fiddle with a computer though, you can go to BackingBuddy.com and enable additional tracks you would like Alexa to be able to play for you, or upload one of your own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found the Alexa tutorials on the Amazon Developer website really useful and was able to find everything I needed there.  From the tutorials I learned to use AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB, Node.js, and Javascript to build the Backing Buddy skill.  For the companion website I used LAMP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apart from the normal learning curve of doing something that was new to me, setting up the account linking was probably the most challenging part.  I suspect it may have been a breeze for someone with previous OAuth experience, but it took a bit of work to get it working.   In the end I found everything I needed in the Alexa documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What I am most proud of is that there are other people out there who have enabled Backing Buddy and are (hopefully) enjoying having Alexa for their backing band as much as I do.  Initially I was concerned that requiring account linking to enable Backing Buddy would discourage anyone from trying it out, but that has not been the case.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a whole lot about about developing Alexa skills and got a great introduction to how fun it can be.  Obviously there is much more to learn, but I am looking forward to doing more, and am excited to see how the technology will continue to evolve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Backing Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I definitely plan to keep improving Backing Buddy.  Next up is adding more tracks to select from and selections for piano players to jam with.  Also based on feedback I have received from users I am working on some tweaks the interaction with Alexa.  Basically any suggestion I receive from users will get on the What's next list.  Kind of like when my Boss asks me to do something, except I will enjoy doing it :)
