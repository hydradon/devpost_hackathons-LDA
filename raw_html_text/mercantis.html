                <p>
                    Mercantis provides a secure marketplace for verified medical research and EMR data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Health research while necessary, is inefficient and costly. Why? In part, because public datasets are not aggregated and key terms are not easily searchable. As much as 85% of medical research is redundant, costing us nearly $200 billion annually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only way to get a specific dataset from a scientist is to personally ask researchers. Unfortunately researchers are often reluctant to share because it is risky and they are not being compensated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The privacy and security of health data also poses a large ethical concern. Studies show that more than 80% of consumers are willing to share their health data for research&mdash;but it must be private and secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly patients have had little control over their health information. In research, participants are paid for their data but are then separated from any future use of that data.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Enter Mercantis.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Mercantis offers a novel Ethereum-based solution with a React frontend. After receiving the participant&rsquo;s consent, the researcher uploads the participant&rsquo;s health data onto the blockchain as an electronic health record. Within the application, other researchers can obtain this raw de-identified data by paying the source researcher and participant a nominal fee.
