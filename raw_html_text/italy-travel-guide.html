                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I loved traveling, but didn't like carrying large travel guides everywhere I went. So I was one of the first to write travel guides for iPhone and Android phones. They included lots of information you would need, such as must see locations, tips on traveling, everything that is near you, weather, local time, and much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app stores lots of info inside, but also had updates you can load when on the go, such as upcoming events and new must see places. This is what I moved to OpenShift. You can also record your own blog within the app, and let others keep track of your journey. This is all stored on mySQL on OpenShift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My app is a full travel guide to Italy. It stores the data on the device, after checking for updated and downloading updates such as new events and must see locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it in objective-c originally, and the server runs on php. All the data is stored in a mysql database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was quite easy to setup openShift, but I did have trouble getting the credits at first. Then I was unsure what database was available to store info on, and picked the wrong one. I had to login as the server to see what was availalbe to me as opposed to what was available to the mysql server. Then I had a lot of data to transfer, so had to use SSH to get that data onto a server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app stores lots of info inside, but also had updates you can load when on the go, such as upcoming events and new must see places.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How easy it was to use OpenShift, as well as updating my web code from github. This was a lot easier than how I did it in the past using a shared server. And I lover just being able to check my changed into github, which kicks of a new build of the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Italy Travel Guide
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More UI improvements for the app, plus more info stored on the server that is accessible for users. I would like to create an easy way for a users friends and family to follow their journey, and see what they are seeing.
