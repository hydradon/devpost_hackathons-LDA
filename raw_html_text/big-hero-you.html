                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to revolutionize the way people think about exercise outside of the gym. Exercise does not have to be restricted to one place, it can include exploring the city you live in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Exercise is important for everybody, but especially for people with diabetes. But exercise isn't limited to lifting weights, it includes going to a local park, or visiting a museum. The app we built has multiple picture challenges, where users have to go to different locations around the city and document their adventure to earn points. The goal is to encourage people with diabetes to incorporate exercise into their daily lives by doing things you enjoy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built around a gamification of exercise, where users can build up points by completing different activities that take them all around the city. The points and challenges are all stored on Parse. The app was built using objective-c and is dynamically populated from data pulled from the Parse database.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parse is a nice framework that makes backend work a lot easier.
