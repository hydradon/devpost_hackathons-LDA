                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have elderly grandparents that are feeling the effects of old age - difficulty with remembering, moving, hearing and seeing. Research shows that there are many benefits of video games for seniors but there is a lack of viable mobility games that exist today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Play fun games that encourage both brain and body exercises to give the maximum benefit to seniors. This demo is for a piano game that encourages working on auditory, visual, memory and motor skills. In addition we created a roll the ball game and a basketball game.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity Engine to create a game in 3D implementing Leap Motion.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Creating a user interface that is senior friendly. This includes big text and easy to follow instructions. Simple games will continue to be made that incorporate exercising both arms and memory.
