                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When trying to come up with a lit playlist on Spotify, there's often a struggle to balance songs "early" on, when there are few people and conversation is quiet, with the songs you'd typically want to dance to as the night wears on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if your playlist automatically curated itself based on some measure of how "lit" a party is?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We leverage the fact that nearly everyone has a smartphone, and nearly every smartphone comes with WiFi. The IEEE802.11 standard includes a type of link-level data frame called "probe requests" which are generated by WiFi radios as they search for possible access points. These requests are WiFi "metadata" essentially - always there and indicative of a radio - but fortunately do not contain any personally-identifying data. Assuming that on average the number of WiFi radios grows linearly with the number of nearby people, we come up with a broad measure of attendance at a party
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is split into three levels of abstraction: the monitor device which captures WiFi probe requests, a cloud-based backend that acts as a data store as well as API server, and a web-based front end client for the end user to see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, this could operate using an internet-capable embedded device monitoring data frames, a cloud-based backend API exposing a data store, and a web-based front end client for the end user. Unfortunately, the hardware available to us did not have a driver capable of monitoring link level WiFi frames. A workaround was to substitute a Macbook Pro for this "embedded device", while remaining relatively platform-agnostic in our software for a potential future deployment on a capable device.

                    It seems to work?

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how the WiFi stack is implemented in Linux, and how to work with link-level 802.11 frames
                </p>

                    What's next for Party Litmus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is open source and so it's hopefully extensible by anyone who finds a use for it. Ideally, we'd like to be able to incorporate other data into some sort of inference pipeline to provide a better descriptor of "litness" (since attendance by itself is not the ultimate factor)
