                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am extremely interested in the science fiction genre and game design. Therefore I combined my two favorite hobbies into this game.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My group used the Unity 3D Engine primarily to build the world.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were several bugs in our complete product. It took us a while to find the problems in our code and make corrections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My group is very proud of completing this product in the allotted time. Furthermore it was very difficult to design the geography of the world itself with the various assets and scripts.

                    My group learned valuable experience in programming user control and interface UI.

                    We plan to create an Oculus version of the game.
