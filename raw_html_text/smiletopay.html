From the simple idea of using the smile as an input interface, we expanded our original concept (smile to pay) into three enjoyable experience!

                    was a challenge, as this was the first time we had experienced image recognition. Additionally breaking down the webcam output into base64 images, then sending it to the backend to decode into raw binary &amp; then requesting the output from oxford. The second challenge we faced was to expand the application across two new applications within half a day.
