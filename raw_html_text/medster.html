                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At some point in your life, you will have to blindly trust a complete stranger to defend your interest, and it is in your interest to be surrounded by the bests. We believe that by using the blockchain, you can check all previous cases (e.g surgeries in a medical case, court cases in a penal case) of this person.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows a surgeon to write the result of its operation in an immutable way, available to all to see.
It allows a patient to estimate how good a surgeon performs and to enforce that the surgeon did not cheat while submitting its feedback.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A web server implemented in go is responsible for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Providing the content to be displayed on the web interface.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Interacting with the Ethereum blockchain through the use a smart contract implemented with Solidity and wrapped with geth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is also the authentication server that allows doctors to write on the blockchain and used to validate those transaction.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had practical knowledge of smart contracts and our theoretical understanding was limited at the beginning of this hackathon. As almost every resources we came across were javascript implementation, writing our first transaction on the blockchain through our go script took us a long time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest accomplishment in this project is to write our first ever block on the chain. We started from almost no knowledge to writing something! It was very satisfying.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Basics of Smart Contracts, Solidity, geth, infura, ...

                    What's next for Medster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of now Medster is more of a proof of concept, inviting people to think a bit more about how trust in services provider can be rethink thanks to the use of blockchains. One could easily use the same principle for storing real-estate, records of athlete, ...
