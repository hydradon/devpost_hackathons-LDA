                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Put together a big app idea and started a large project.
Could have used existing code and libraries better.
We all chose things outside of what we have experience in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to do some things.
Planning and ideation phase was excellent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prototyping the app the day before would have been useful.
We created good design and good backend but we could have better communication regarding integration.
