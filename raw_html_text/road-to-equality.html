                    Road to equality is a game that demonstrates the difficulties that women have to face as well letting the player empathise with the characters very easily. In the game, you help a girl called Asha, which means hope, to break past the effects of gender inequality and spread the word about the problem.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split our team of 5 into smaller teams; coding and design and this way it made it easier to work. We had a shared email which meant we all could code. We also asked pupils in our school to test it and the main feedback was the storyline needed a bit of work which we plan to do next.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble finishing it by the deadline and initially we didn't have an android to test the app. We managed to do a reasonable amount on the Codeathon day but weren't able to do any more till 2 weeks before submission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned a lot in the making of this app. The main learning point would be the importance of a routine and plan. This came after we planned the codeathon day but not after that causing a lot of last minute scrambles.
