                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While sites like GroupMe and Facebook let you set up a long-term series of events, it's difficult to find friends to help learn, assist with, or mentor short-term tech projects. We wanted to set up women in computing with local students, mentors, and companies looking for assistance with pet projects or jobs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a platform where users can create accounts and projects, then browse for the accounts and projects near them. They can see the names, locations, and genders of nearby programmers and which projects they're working on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a web server in Flask that displayed the webpage and handled the database and user accounts. It would also make API calls to Mapquest. We then hosted the server on an Amazon EC2 virtual machine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the SQL database, wrangling AWS firewalls, sifting through CSS, and not getting distracted by Overwatch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have working, secure user accounts with passwords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the Flask web framework, as well as more CSS than we'd care to admit.
                </p>

                    What's next for Tinder4Tech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to clean up the interface and the links, as well as allow users to sort by project type, gender, location, etc.
