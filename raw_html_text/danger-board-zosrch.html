                    We are a group of skateboarders who often use our boards to travel. Even though we love to ride our boards, riding them in the dark is dangerous because it is difficult to avoid rocks and other objects due to the fact that we aren't able to see said rocks. We wanted to build a board that can avoid such objects, thus allowing us to ride with ease of mind. We recall talking to one of the students in the hackathon and his friend's experience with a longboard. He noted that his friend accidentally hit a rock and ended up falling at over 30 miles per hour speeds. His face was damaged and scarred. With our product, he would have avoided that.
