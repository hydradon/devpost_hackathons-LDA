                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honours madness.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It skips (sometimes). Hates usb3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throwing code together to get mpv to play and skip, and read from a TTY on the host end.
Artistically crafted, bespoke C++ code on the 'duino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    X86 and ARC was a marriage made to be broken. An AVR would've been more reliable, and Serial over USB turned out to be really flakey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works when it feels like it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some microcontrollers are very regressive and anti-progress when it comes to the latest universal serial bus specifications and implementations.
                </p>

                    What's next for Hit to skip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You tell me.
