                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we have been put through boring types of learning in a day to day basis. We found games to be engaging and the best way for us to focus while learning. So we believed this application was an attempt to gamify learning about money management to make it not only entertaining for students but of people of all ages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a clicking based learning game for money management. It gives player case scenarios as they make money in which they have to see where to carefully spend their money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html/css to build the front end of it. MongoDB was the backend in which we stored data for case scenarios and user info. Javascript and Jquery were used for the mechanics of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MongoDB was a true challenge to use. As well as web programming as this was the first time 3 out of the 4 members on the team touched something other than java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly learning how to use and implement the database was the most satisfying achievement. Along the way, many of us also learned new languages in the web development field that can be used later at not only other hackathons but professionally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use databases, web development languages and apis such as javascript,html,css,jquery. We learned how to use proper version control between four people with the use of git.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ByteTheBudget
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next step is hopefully to implement levels so player feel more of an incentive to play. This will also come with the addition of more scenarios to make it more entertaining aswell as difficulty. We will see about adding upgrades players can purchase for sense of progress. Lastly would be to balance the game fairly.
