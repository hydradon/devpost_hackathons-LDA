                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tired of the cluttered class schedule on our R'web. It was difficult to easily see the class instructors, locations, and meetings days/times all at once.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user inputs their class and relevant info. Our tool generates a table with important class information clearly displayed. Rows can be deleted, and the table can be cleared. It can also be downloaded as a pdf file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML code and javascript, using the jquery library for downloading.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was really difficult figuring how to let the user download the table as a pdf.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a web interface with intuitive options (like buttons and time selectors). Exporting the table as a pdf.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned a lot about javascript options for interactivity and integrating it with html.
                </p>

                    What's next for UCR SimpleSchedule
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to edit cells in the table. We also want to be able to export the table in more formats (image, csv).
