                    Uses six motors in pairs, oriented such that their prop rotation is at 90 degrees to both other pairs.  This, combined with reversible ESCs and 3D (bidirectional) props allows a thrust vector or torque to be established in any direction.  This allows it to fly with unparalleled freedom of movement, full control of all three linear and rotational axes, independently and statically (i.e. it can hover pointing straight down, or fly forward while spinning continuously on roll, or almost any other maneuver)

                    The physical device was fabricated from aluminum tube, cut to 1' lengths and bolted together where they meet in the middle.  The motors were mounted to holes drilled near the end of these tubes.

                    The original flight controller I intended to use is not supported by cleanflight (the code base that was used, mainly for IMU filtering), though it took several hours and attempts to use other software to give up on using it with cleanflight.  The math required to convert between global and local axes, particularly its optimization to run on an embedded arm processor, took most of Saturday.

                    I learned what quanternions and are how they (basically) work, a subject which I was entirely unfarmiliar with going into this.

                    I plan to continue developing the control algorithms , and include attitude stabilization and linear thrust vectoring as well.
