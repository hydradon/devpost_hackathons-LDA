                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To investigate and find a new way of traffic analysis talking about the driving context. I like maths and investigating, so I made a deep search to get this project done
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives a full explanation of how you can represent a life problem in an abstract math model. With this achievement, we can now easily transport the math model to a computer model, specifically to AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built by making a deep search and investigation, giving an explanation and argument to every problem found and to be solved about traffic in M&eacute;xico.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a new math model analysis, finding the math solution to explain the traffic congestion, delimiting this to M&eacute;xico.

                <p>
                    Making a great and cool AI that can learn like a real human.
