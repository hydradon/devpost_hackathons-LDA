                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all need clothes... not much inspiration was required.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a chatbot before the purhcase, on the website where the user can put in their interests, musical tastes and other parameters and clothes that are likely to suit those tastes will come up.
We also have a smart fitting room, where users can 'scan' their clothes and give their opinion of said clothes inside the changing room. If they like the clothes, we can show them similar clothes they would like, if not we can make suggestions of other items of clothing they would like.
There is also a Messenger chatbot for after the purchase, to get the users' opinions on both their shopping experience and their purchase, to see if they are happy with it.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The client app is built with Ionic.
The backend is built with Django and GraphQL.
The initial chat bot is built in AWS and the post purchase chat bot is built with Chatfuel.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS IS SO BADLY DOCUMENTED.
Connecting everything togther always tends to be a pain.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made something cool in such a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GraphQL frontend is not as easy as we thought.
Chatbots can be fun to make (at times).
You need to focus more on getting stuff done than on the minor details.
