                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a machine learning program that can recognize shapes you draw in the air
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a Keras model and allows you to post pictures, but it's a failure since it only works 50% of the time
(accuracy ~55%)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a Keras model with Tensor backend. It's coded in python and was originally intended to 
take in live video feed and process it at intervals after the shape flashes in game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the dimensions of images right, it was such a pain.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Creating the baseline structure for ML program.
