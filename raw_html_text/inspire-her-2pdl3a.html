                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Women who want to make a difference by teaching or expanding their skill set at a small level from home.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects women in a tutor - student role for skill building.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the web building service, Wix, and its existing plugins, as well as features from Google (Forms).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Limitations of a free platform were a challenge- specifically the unavailability of certain plugins that would go hand-in-hand with what was initially planned. Making the website less complex for first time users and ensuring an application form is set in place to create a safe place for women by initial screening of applications.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website has come very close to what we had imagined. We are proud to be in a position of being able to provide a service that can make a difference to women, in empowering them with skills needed to build or start a career.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've been able to enhance our brainstorming skills, especially being able to narrow down on big categories such as 'Women Empowerment' and be able to focus on identifying problems for which a solution can be manageable in the given time frame. This project has allowed us to utilize our time management skills to the best of our abilities, while breaking down the process into smaller feasible portions. We've learnt how to make best use of available resources, at the same time building on them to cater to our needs.

                    What's next for Inspire Her
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a chatting, voice, and video call plugin for tutor and student to be able to talk on the website itself. This would ensure sure that no one (student or tutor) has to exchange their personal information in order to help or to get help from someone.
Creating a simple and unified application/registration process so that applications upon approval create a profile for the webpage itself.
