                    Inspiration - wanting to chat online with privacy
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - hosts a site, stores file/files, starting to develop user logins
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - written with html, css and javascript. The site is hosted using Google cloud platform, and the domain was from domain.com
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - lots as nobody in the team had configured a cloud server or hosted a website before
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - everything as it was a big learning curve
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - lots
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ChatNotts - developing a database for messaging, implementing the encryption that we have written but not attached to the site
