                    Platform for students to interact and collaborate for academic course

                <p>
                    Problem
One of the largest problems today involves the education of our next generation. According to a recent study, researchers asked over a 1000 students the same question, 'why students fail courses and drop out of colleges?'. From the pool, 52% of students replied with the lack of motivation and the lack of studying correctly amongst peers. There have been some solutions made for students who are struggling with interacting with peers and efficiently studying, however, there is no bridge between the two in the market today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution
Coursemates is a platform driven for students like us who have trouble interacting and working with other classmates on an academic level. There are levels of understanding material and that includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Going over course material
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reviewing material with outside sources
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Application via explanations to students
This platform allows all aspects stated above through a communal environment where students are capable of posting and talking about posted work.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Coursemates is a web app that allows users to post material onto a class page they are enrolled in and provides other users to like/dislike, and comment on the material. What separates us from other platforms is the gamification that encourages users to actively contribute where every post (that results in great interaction amongst other users) shall give the user who posted 'bit points'. More successful posts, more bit points, which may be converted into redeemable rewards with help of sponsors.

 Future goals for coursemates are to:
