                    Knowledge is in you, you need to know it. (Inspired by Khan Academy and Quizup)
                </p>
                <p>
                    GrayMatter demo is just a quiz app where a person from age group of 5-10 years can participate in the quiz and see their scores and a cooling break app that would allow you to take break and play a game of choosing numbers from smallest to largest.

                            Multiplayer Mode: Where people can see the performance analytics of their competitors and compare themselves from them and analytics would suggest people to work on certain parts of their intelligence.

                            Adaptive Learning: People would get question as per their age group but the test would adapt as per the capability of the person, so to give them good challenge while performing well and support them by giving them question they like to improve confidence level while the person is not performing well.

                            Cognitive Science analytics that would allow people to know which part they need to work on and what are the proposed exercises in the app to get warmup.

                            Cooling break zone: Cooling break zone would be more intuitive in the coming future and would feature good games, puzzles and tasks that would also help in clearning your mind to come back fresh for test the other time.
