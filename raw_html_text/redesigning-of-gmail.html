                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our team members have gotten exposure to user experience and it's importance through work or school. We understand that if consumers are unable to use the product, it is of no use. As Tim Berners-Lee stated, "the power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect".

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uplifts functionality barriers faced by everyday users who may or may not be familiar with the platform or technology itself.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeping UX principals in mind we modified the new Gmail interface to add simplicity and make it more accessible. 
We created the design in Adobe Illustrator and implemented it into a working prototype using Axure.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To maintain the essence of the website while working on the design
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Because this was a fictional persona it was difficult to understand the users perspective, hence each team member used the site as if they were the users and noted what aspects of the design needed to be improved while keeping in mind the limitations of different demographics.
                    </li>

                    What's next for Redesigning of Gmail
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps would be to test our prototype. We can use websites such as usertesting.com to have users give us feedback on our design and modify our design based on what users say.
