                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted an application that would help people in times of great stress where every second counts. We wanted to integrate multiple things into one click. These times are after such many things are forgotten about. We want to take one thing off the mind of people who are in a natural disaster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application allows you to use Google Cloud Vision to get the geolocation of a landmark or use your device's native GPS data. Then depending on the type of disaster, the coordinate that is either the highest or lowest position nearest the user is then displayed as a safe area the user can go towards in order to get out of danger. Also, it sends a customized tweet with essential information to let friends and family know about the latest whereabouts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was built using Google Cloud API as part of the python backend. Then we created a Javascript frontend. Google Maps API was also used in the backend and frontend. We used Flask as a way to connect the two together. Lastly, we used the Twitter API to send custom twitters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about JS and how to use the Google Cloud Platform. We also learned how to use documentation and how to write clean code. It gave us a greater appreciation of good documentation as we also had the great pleasure of using third-party documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The one main challenge that the team faced was the implementation of the JS and Flask. One of the main issues as to why it was hard was because we didn't have too much experience with JS. We are most definitely happy with that we were able to get Google Cloud Platform working properly.

                    What's next for Piclo.io
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that the next logical step for us is to develop a phone application. Also, we plan on looking at an offline mode. In contrast, we also plan to implement real-time data for better planning before the disaster.
