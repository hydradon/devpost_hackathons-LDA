                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to see if there was a way to generate an incentive to code based on specific interests, rather than an already established interest to code.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Node.js for back end with Express as my web framework. I was able to tie in PostgreSQL really nicely with "pg", a PostgreSQL wrapper for Node.js.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    The main challenge I ran into was implementing a log in system for the
                    <strong>
                        first time
                    </strong>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got the log in system working and I made the initial tutorial simple enough to follow but a tad challenging for beginners.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to implement and host a back end (all my back end projects have been super simple and were local). How to make a log in system, and how to tie PostgreSQL in with Node.js (I've only done MongoDB with Node).

                    I plan on taking the project farther and maybe try to partner with certain companies to get exclusive discount codes. Maybe even try to get a decent user base. I will be using it to learn React from here on out!
