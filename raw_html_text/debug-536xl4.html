                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In recent times, Coronavirus has become a major concern for the world. Even though most worry about catching the virus, few are aware of the seriousness of the situation. With that, our group created this app called DeBug, aiming at spreading awareness both locally and globally. The inspirations for our name originated from a synonym of disease, &ldquo;bug,&rdquo; and since our goal is to promote a safer and healthier environment for people around the globe, &ldquo;De&rdquo; bug, we named it DeBug.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app debug serves as a disease Wikipedia, where we will inform the people about the information disease such as symptom,, where it originated from, the amount of people that are infected and most importantly, how to prevent the disease. For example, for Coronavirus, our app, still developing, will have the ability to locate stores that have masks and inform people on what they need to be cautious of in order to reduce the chance of getting infected. The app also allows users to report any types of suspicious sickness they are experiencing or witnessed. Our team will require proofs and evidences such as doctor&rsquo;s notes to determine the validity of the information reported.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built on Android platform with Android Studio, which gave us huge ability to put our apps on billions of devices. The building also uses the Google Map&rsquo;s api which gave us the finest data on maps.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once in developing, there&rsquo;s a serious bug when we can not add stuff to the list. We finally solve the issue by step by step debugging and looking at the logs. And finally discovers the non-static list is the reason why we can&rsquo;t add.

                    What's next for DeBug
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app DeBug is still in a developing stage. However, the app will advance as the team gain experiences from improving and building the app overtime. Our primary goals are definitely to improve our ways to confirm the validity of users&rsquo; reports. Secondly, our target is to gain access to certified doctors, where they will be able to give accurate advices on how to prevent infections. Lastly, we wish to implement the location feature where we will be able to access the users&rsquo; locations and provide them with information of local trending sickness and diseases.
