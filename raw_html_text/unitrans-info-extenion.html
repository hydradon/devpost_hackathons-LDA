                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you leave your house or need a hands free way to get Unitrans info quickly. When you don't want to use your data or data isn't available but sms is still available.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa skills and SMS response will tell you information about when the bus will arrive as well as predict when you will get to your destination
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python/Flask for the back end. Alexa Skill and Twilio makes an api request to my server that is deploy in Google App Engine

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa Skills has no debug console so I don't know whats wrong.
