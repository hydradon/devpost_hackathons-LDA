                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used to get bored a lot without a good way to discover media objects. When we found music, videos, etc that we liked some times we weren't that comfortable posting them on platforms such as Facebook.

                <p>
                    Let's you post media objects (articles, videos, or images) as yourself or anonymous for your friends to see. Let's you see how much people from different areas are interacting with you on the app via a map.
