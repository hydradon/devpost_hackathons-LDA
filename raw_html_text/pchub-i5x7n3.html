                    Background
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Systers has partnered with Peace Corps to develop several web and mobile applications. All of the applications have separate repos on our GitHub page, but we don't have a central HUB for Peace Corps staff and volunteers to access all of the applications.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Goal of the Hack
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The goal of the hackathon is to create a web application that will be the Peace Corps App HUB. The hub should have login access, but also include access to all of our Peace Corps products. The language you choose must be open source as to keep to the initiative of open government initiative of the Peace Corps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: We do have mobile products. How would users view/access mobile products?
                </p>

                    All this work was performed during Systers Google Summer of Code 2014 and 2015. Please see the GSoC assignments so for each year so that you can see what the students have worked on for each of the project. This is not a requirement, but you may want to read background on the projects.

                    After the hackathon, we would love for all the participants to continue to collaborate with Systers and others who will contribute and continue the work that you are doing. It would be great if you can submit a PR for your design work against the &ldquo;develop&rdquo; branch on Systers PCHub GitHub repo.
