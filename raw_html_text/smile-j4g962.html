                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A fellow classmate from our high school started a trend where he would take many selfies with him and other people smiling and post them on Twitter with the hashtag #smilethursday. Through these pictures, he was able to spread happiness and smiles to everyone he encountered and to the people who followed him on Twitter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smile! lets users take selfies with other people smiling in front of the camera, share them, and browse through the smiles of other people to help brighten the user's day. The application makes sure that there are at least two people smiling in front of the camera so that happiness can be shared among as many people as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app for iOS using Swift along with Facebook SDK for login and Microsoft Cognitive Services Face API for smile verification. Our back end was built using mainly Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. We gave each image a unique ID that pointed to the actual image file, which we stored in the server's file system.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into were time constraints, unfamiliarity with front iOS and back end server development, and tiredness from lack of adequate sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully create a functioning app that incorporated all of the main features we planned to implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to brainstorm as a team, work efficiently as a team, and how to use all of the technology required to implement our app idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smile!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to improve the user interface and experience, strengthen security on the server side, and develop an Android version as well so that more mobile users can smile!
