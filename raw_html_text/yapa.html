                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're both avid podcast listeners, but we often run into problems like:
                </p>
                <p>
                    During a conversation with a friend, I&rsquo;m reminded of something I heard in a podcast. But I have no idea
                    <em>
                        which
                    </em>
                    episode it was in, nor how far in to the episode the particular part was.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When listening to a podcast, sometimes I&rsquo;m bored of the current topic and want to jump ahead. I hit jump forward a few times, and spend a few effortful seconds figuring out what they&rsquo;re talking about. Repeat till I find a new topic, then go back till I find the beginning of that topic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When listening to a podcast, sometimes the speaker says something really interesting that I want to hear again. But again, I&rsquo;m dropped mid-sentence and have to focus to orient myself, then wait a few seconds in that vigilant state to get to the part I was looking for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yapa transcribes podcasts. That lets me:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Find the episode and timestamp I want to tell my friend about using whatever key words I remember
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Read through the transcript and jump to the next topic I&rsquo;m interested in
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Seek back/forward and land on the beginning of a sentence every time
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The transcription is performed by a service called Assembly AI. We built a backend in Rails, which we deployed on Heroku. We built an iOS app with Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Transcriptions aren't perfect! (But we think they're good enough to make this useful)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We'd like to automate the process of adding "chapter markers" to a podcast, but automatically classifying sections of a podcast into chapters is difficult.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We'd like to automatically identify different speakers in a podcast, but that functionality in the transcription API we chose seems to be broken.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Using this for the first time felt
                        <em>
                            really good
                        </em>
                        . It scratched a huge itch.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to navigate audio like text is
                    <em>
                        powerful
                    </em>
                    . Its one of the big pain points of consuming audio, and even our simple v0 proved its usefulness. There&rsquo;s magic here.
                </p>
