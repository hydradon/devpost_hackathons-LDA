                    Imagine you're somewhere in the world on holiday. Then your worst nightmare comes true and some kind of catastrophe happens. Your family and friends are worried about your well-being and you want to tell them that you are still alive. Enter hacksmash. To figure out if you're still OK, your loved ones can simply write a textmessage with a query about you and your phonenumber to our service. It immediately checks if either you already sign in with your current status or, if not, sends you a text message asking you to check in, because your family and friends are worried about you. Thanks to Twilio this even works if you don't have any internet connection at all or if it's not possible to call due to various reasons.
                </p>

                    Hacksmash, tell the important people in your life that your still alive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But we didn't want to think only about catastrophies. Why not have some fun as well. Connecting Twilio with Dubsmash to push your conversations to the next level. Speechregognition catches your text and directly pipes it as search query to dubsmash. Your phonepartner then doesn't receive your original text, but the paired dubsmash snippet. Good laughs are ensured ;)
