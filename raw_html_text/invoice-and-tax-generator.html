                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am very interested in business and I am interested in Accounting. Invoices and taxes are one of the most important things in Accounting and I want to make doing invoices and taxes easier. I want to create an app that the user only needs to fill in the invoice, they can fill it in and

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has a page that the customer can look up all the items available in the store. There is a tax calculator where both the owner and the user can use. The invoice where the owner can fill in the bill and keep track of all the products that sold and it is easier for them to do the tax. Each bill is saved directly into the computer once it is filled.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used arrays to put the items into the list so if there are new items, it will be easy to edit and add new items. I put the descriptions in and the pictures so it is convenient for the clients to use. I used JavaScript and php to adding or removing new rows of products so the invoices are easy to edit. All the invoices are saved into the computer so the owner can keep tracks of the bills.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am not very familiar with JavaScript so it got very hard to get all the functions working. When I did the adding and removing columns, it got stuck and I struggled with working with the functions. I did not have too much time to work on CSS so the application may not very well-designed and the user may feel hard to follow.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am get used to with php although I was so unfamiliar with it at the start of the hackathon. I am more familiar with arrays and functions in coding.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about php and HTML which are the two major concepts in many projects. This will be helpful in my future projects. I also learn about Data Science and Machine Learning during the workshops. The workshops about pitching also helps me to present myself better.

                    Voice recognitions will be the next step for Invoice and Tax Generator. The user can use their voice to insert the data, calculate the tax or look for products.
