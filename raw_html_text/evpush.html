                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this app came from the MHacks 9 app, which was a mobile app used to organize the MHacks event
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EvPush is an sms event planning platform, with which event hosts can simply text the EvPush number and plan events, make announcements, and have members sign up. EvPush is the first ever sms platform for events on the planet, and truly brings the beauty of technology to everyone. While we take smartphones for granted, statistics show 33% of canadians dont have a smartphone! This makes our app accessible to more people than the traditional application. So we made events available to everyone. After all, as with every party, the more the marrier!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All database work was done in firebase, python, swift, using mapkit and core data

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Frameworks melted down xcode, cocoapods didn't work, xcode authentication failures, wifi issues, lack of macintosh computers for team, Xcode converted to swift 3 without my permission, core data meltdown, pathway failure in terminal. Name it, it went wrong.
