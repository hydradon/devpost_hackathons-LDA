                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought that a computer could translate morse code because it is difficult for a person to translate it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user blinks morse code and the computer translates it into the actual letters and words
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Python, and dlib and cv2 libraries to build it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a timer so the program could recognize different letters between the dashes and dots
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to continually increase the speed of my blinks, and i learned some morse code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned some morse code and how to set timers in python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Morse Code Translator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe i'll make a website and put the translator on it.
