                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the monkey-shaped hats that I had  received the first night of the Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application was meant to mimic other simple but addicting tapping games in order to alleviate boredom. The time between each of the monkey's attempt to steal the banana, as well as the speed in which it reaches the banana, is randomized so it would impossible to predict exactly when the monkey would strike next. Every time the user prevents the monkey from reaching the banana by tapping its hand, the user gains one additional point. If the monkey manages to reach the banana before the user can tap its hand, the game is over. If the monkey's hand is tapped before it attempts to steal the banana, the game is over. After every 10 points gained, the likelihood that the monkey will strike faster will increase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application was built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Custom png images were created in Inkscape to represent the monkey, banana, and other sprites such as the title image. jQuery was used instead of Javascript because it required less physical code and had more support for the animated movements. The position of the hand would be read every time it was clicked to see if it had already reached the banana or if it was in an acceptable range to receive a point.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge I faced was coming up with the idea for the game. During the first 2 hours of the Hackathon, I had began working on two or three other projects and quickly abandoned them because I did not feel they were interesting enough. Other issues I faced was deciding what I could implement and what I had to take out from the initial ideas of the application due to the complexity of implementing each aspect of the game and the limited time I had to create it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest accomplishment is creating a fully working web game that can work across many of the major platforms/browsers. This is the first html game I had successfully created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about jQuery and how I could use it to control the images in a way to make it look like a singular animated character. I also learned about the complexity of code and instructions that simple tapping games implement and that much logic is needed to accomplish the most simplest of tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for I Want the Banana
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although the current version is available to a wider range of browsers and platforms,
                    <strong>
                        I Want the Banana
                    </strong>
                    will hopefully become an Android App and have many more features, such as a more strategic monkey and sudden death battles.
