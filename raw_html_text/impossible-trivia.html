                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Impossible Trivia asks up to twenty true or false questions from several popular trivia categories. The game is structured such that if the player misses a question, the game ends. The questions have been designed so that the average person would get approximately half of the questions correct making
                    <em>
                        beating the game
                    </em>
                    very challenging. After each try, players are told which rank they achieved in the mob ranging from Rat to Godfather.

                <h2>
                    The inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having played multiple trivia games on both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, I wanted to design a game with
                    <strong>
                        high-quality content and the lowest possible friction
                    </strong>
                    . Trivia games are quite popular on these platforms and I was hopeful that if I designed a quality experience I could attract and retain users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to use Alexa-hosted for my back end. The questions are original and I utilized Pro Tools music software for recording and Audacity to achieve the right file format for Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, I wanted to use Firebase for my question database. However, Firebase does not easily integrate with Alexa so I struggled for a couple weeks on this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users have told me that the questions are high quality and that they learn something from the answers. And, although I have been developing on Google Assistant for several years, this is my first significant effort on Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I appreciate the effort that Amazon has put into ISP--from the initial setup to the code sample to the instructional videos. I also commend Amazon for focusing on the success of the developer. I also enjoyed working with the Alexa-hosted backend and the native code editor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Impossible Trivia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to create some kind of daily leaderboard. Because of the structure of the game, the distribution of scores should be such that it is possible that a single person could be a daily leader even with thousands of people playing per day. I would also like to potentially offer questions exclusively from certain categories such as sports, geography, music, etc. Having some visual questions for Echo Show users is also an ambition.
