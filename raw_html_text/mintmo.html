                    </strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For smaller transactions, viewing of account statements, in the monetary world where internet connections are not always reliable and not necessary for smaller transactions. This inspired us to make an offline-transaction application based out of the simplest thing known: SMS.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on small instructions given via SMS, it would perform tasks like sending money to someone or checking dues and bills as well as if a transaction is received or not. For merchants it would be used as a tool to analyze which area is more profit making according to the activity of people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Capital-one APIs and integrating with Twilio, we were able to analyze the incoming texts and then based on that send respective output texts and perform activities. For merchant's end, we are able to analyze a city/zip/area which has high density of transactions done by customers in specified field.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completely new to capital-one API and twilio which made us understand that first before diving into it. Plans of integrating with Myo and Pebble but lack of availability of them reduced our scope.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obtaining large data-sets online and manage a glitch-less connection was difficult and we took out a smart way to tackle the problem using Python. We can get the real time data analysis without refreshing the whole-page but only a part of it using Ajax. Overcame the challenges faced and developed a 'Customer friendly' and 'Simple-yet-Powerful' application.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to integrate APIs with server and client side scripting languages as well as transfer the real time data on the webpage.

                    What's next for Mintmo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to include Machine Learning algorithms and improve its scope in terms of many possible areas like transactions in various fields (like movies, functions etc.) and with the help of data generated from that we can have targeted advertisements.
