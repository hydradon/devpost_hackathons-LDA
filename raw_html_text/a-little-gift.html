                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are people in need, and they need to be connected to things they need for a fuller life. Also, when people give, they encourage other people to give, and it spreads the good feeling of giving all around.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A good Samaritan would find a homeless person in the area and ask them what they need, or it would be printed on a poster that the homeless person makes. They would then fill out a request on the website, and a donor could find requests in their area to connect to the people requesting, so the people in need get what they need.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All-nighters are painful, breaks must be taken to maintain sanity, php is to be avoided when possible, and other teams can surprisingly helpful. Having another team to support you and have your back and boost your morale is great. If help is needed, most people are ready to help if they know the topic. We also learned Google Maps API.
