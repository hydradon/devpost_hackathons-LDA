                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have all faced the fear of not making it to the airport on time for a flight due to either traffic or long security wait times. We decided to create an application that would help relieve the stress of traveling by giving a reminder on when you should ideally leave so that you can make it to your flight on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This android application tells you when you should leave for the airport when you provide your mobile boarding pass. You create an account, enter your Delta flight number, and the application accesses your location and gives you an estimated time to leave. This takes into account traffic as well as security wait times at the airport.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app mainly using node.js, java, and android studio. We also used Amazon Web Services to host our backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of us, we didn't have a lot of previous experience with writing our individual contributions, so we mainly struggled with learning the language and debugging. We were ambitious with our initial idea and had to simplify our project due to time constraints.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a working application that visually looks good and generally does what we want it to do. We spend a lot of time writing and rewriting, and to finally have a finished application is very satisfying.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use REST APIs and JSON format, Amazon Web Services, and Android Studio.
