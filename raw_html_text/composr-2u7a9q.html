                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After being required to make multiple compositions during music class and finding that the process of converting a song to a recorded piece was tedious and led to the piece inevitably being changed, we decided we wanted to make a simpler and more accurate way of recording a composition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ComposR allows anybody to easily create musical compositions by simply playing their piece. Rhythm, pitch and tempo are defined by the user&rsquo;s playing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ComposR is written in Python, with the UI using Pygame. Fourier Transform, a function that separates a waveform into multiple sines and cosines, was used to convert the audio into a specific not that could be documented on the staff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Narrowing down exactly what to do and maintaining a realistic goal was definitely a challenge, as the idea certainly changed drastically throughout the day as we realised what we could and could not do given the time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with audio and exactly how audio can be represented and used in regards to programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ComposR taught us to maintain realistic expectations of what we can finish in a short period of time, and also taught us how to compartmentalize and assign different roles amongst members of a group. We also learned how to work with audio, as previously stated.
