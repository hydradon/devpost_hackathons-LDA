                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create a game that could win the funniest hack category. With this in mind, we were trying to emulate the more childish, borderline-crude type of humor you'd find on early Youtube videos, or Adult Swim TV shows. Basically, we wanted to make a game that was funny in its absurdity alone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game that acts like a space-shooter/bullet-hell arcade game with an interesting design. The main interesting mechanic to our game is that we punish the player for firing haphazardly. If the player shoots too rapidly their character will increase in size and become a bigger target. The size will decrease back to normal over time but this dynamic makes the player fire with intent 100% of the time. The art of our game is where the toilet-humor we mentioned before comes through,
                    <em>
                        literally
                    </em>
                    . The player, enemies, and projectiles are all toilet themed and have humorous sound effects to match.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game with the Unity3D game engine. Our art assets were created in the program Aseprite. Lastly, our audio was mastered using Audacity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge during development was coming up with how we'd incorporate humor into our games design. We knew we could make a game that was both fun to play and funny it was just a matter of what kind of humor we wanted to focus on. Ultimately, we decided to use more low-brow humor.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We we're proud of our ability to create we would call a minimum viable product within our very small time window.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with the Unity3D game engine, and how to code with C#. We also learned how to properly export sprites to Unity3D and how to modify audio files in both their qualities and duration.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Poop De De Scoop will likely not receive a direct sequel. However, the design process proved very valuable to us as a development team and we will use the experiences and skills gained from Poop De De Scoop to create even better projects in the future.
