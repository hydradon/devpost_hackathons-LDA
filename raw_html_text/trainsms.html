                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a frequent commuter, I have found mobile data connectivity patchy; I need a reliable way to get train info.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Send an text to Twillio stating what train station you want to leave from and where you want to go and when. Twillio will then text you the directions to the departure train station, train journey details, and weather info.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built an android app to send SMS's containing GPS location, and journey info to a Flask server hosted by Google Cloud. Used google-directions, open-weather and Twillio to  return data in the form of a text back to the user. The user can also specify when they want to leave. Used Java to build the android app and Python to build the Flask server.
