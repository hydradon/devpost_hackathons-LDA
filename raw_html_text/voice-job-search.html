                    Finding a job that is matching user skills take long time and effort. First of all you need to know the strongest job search websites, then search frequently in them. This process is very tedious and lazy

                <p>
                    Now and using new Alexa Skill called "Jobs search" things become more funny and easier. This skill will get searching criteria from user and search in many job sites and feed him back with available jobs. From Alexa mobile app, user can find link for the job to apply on it if he like it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently skill searches only in one job sit (Github API). Skill is live since 6 march 2017

                    This service is built using Amazon Alexa skill with node.js as Lambda function.
