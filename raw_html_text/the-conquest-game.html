                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a game that would fit the intrests of all group members, as having a common intrest helps build teamwork and team efficency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project we made was a game. Even though games were not a common topic for every group member, it was still a good expirence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vy made the art work, while Eric taught Triet how to program. After Vy finished her artwork and Triet finished the rest of the programming by himself, Eric assembled the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges were the logical problems in our code, but we still made it to the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eric is so proud of his group members because Vy and Triet had no expirence in art or programming, but they made outstanding progress during the 14 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group we learned how to work together as total stranger (Vy and Triet were not strangers), and how we made so much progress from no expirence (Eric had 9 years of programming expirence).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Conquest Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More Game mechanics, more players, comfortable controls, more music, and more fun.
