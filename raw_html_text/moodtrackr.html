                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> One of the biggest issues with mental illness today is monitoring patients outside of session hours. A patient can be subject to an episode without a psychologist being aware. We want to eliminate the risk by alerting a care giver when certain red flags become present.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> MoodTrackr begins by collecting status updates form various social networking platforms. From there, each update is given a sentiment analysis and a risk factor is generated. If a patient is below a certain threshold, the care giver will be notified and immediate action can be taken via a messaging service in the app. It can also be used to monitor people in an alcohol or drug abuse workshop to ensure sobriety.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> MoodTrackr was built with JavaScript and Angular for the front-end and Java for the back-end.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> One of the biggest challenges we ran into was building an intuitive user interface. Fitting together the puzzle was a task we found enticing. We had no choice but to piece together our knowledge to birth MoodTrackr.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> MoodTrackr is collectively everyone's first web app. Through a friendship only 36 years old, a successful web app was created.

                    What's next for MoodTrackr
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> MoodTrackr will collect from as many social media networks as possible. There will also be an instant messaging service implemented so that a care giver may communicate with a patient at any given time.
