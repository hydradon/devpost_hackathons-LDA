                    I learned a lot About how to use Unity, I really wanted to teach the user about the dangers of unhealthy eating. I had some experience with C# before, but besides that this has been a new experience for me. I wasn't able to complete a key part of my project so I doesn't function, but it was a great project for my first hackathon!
