                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inefficient, manual process for verifying information in the lending process as it pertains to loans gives us reason to believe we can use modern technology to improve this industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a POC that takes a simple participant, in  our case a payroll processor, and allows them to push a hash of information into a blockchain database. The intent is to use this hash to instantly validate information on behalf of the user and the processor for entities such as banks and mortgage brokers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Hyperledger Composer to construct the blockchain logic and connect to a front end client.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating ReactJS with our blockchain.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A good use case, a functioning blockchain network, and almost completing a UI integration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for stubTx
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue to build out the use case. We plan on taking this back to our firm to continue the work and expand on the use case to incorporate more actors as well as an identity solution long term.
