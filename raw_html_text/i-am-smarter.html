                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually I had a very funny inspiration to build the skill. Recently, one of my friend said that I always say that I know everything and he finds it annoying. I didn't believe it and asked him to recount the times I have said this. He began saying the instances and I realised that it was indeed true. So, I created this Alexa skill for those like my friend who can ask friends like me to play this quiz and get a little back to the ground from the sky.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This might seem like an ordinary quiz game with a single question and three options to choose from. But, the catch is that the three options displayed is not the right answer at all. All the three options are wrong. So, no matter what option the user chooses, the next answer mocks you saying you got it wrong and the correct answer is said.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the ask framework developed by the Alexa Team. The screens designed for Echo spot and other display enabled devices were developed using the Alexa's latest APL Language.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into some asynchronous call issues for a long time and finally gave up and now I have to data for the quiz stored locally so no network issues can stop the skill from accessing the questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt a lot about the new APL language by Alexa and it is very interesting to see how it works. Might take some more time to adjust to the language but it is fun to build.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt that asynchronous calls are a big headache to deal with(maybe because I am still missing something important) and also learnt APL language by Alexa.

                <p>
                    I will further improve the display in different devices and also include the touch based input for the options.
