                    Being the international students, it is a hassle for us to find the best value flight during vacations. We wanted to bring multiple websites to book plane tickets to a single platform in the form of an extension.

                <h2>
                    It has 6 commonly used websites to book flights.

                    We were a team of two with very limited knowledge of HTML. We spent the first day brainstorming and going through tutorials and videos on HTML and CSS. We used these two languages to come up with this extension.

                <h2>
                    The formatting part was the toughest part of our project.

                    Though a small project, we happen to create a meaningful program in our very first hackathon, which we are really happy about.

                    In addition to enhancing out skills of HTML and CSS, we learned to code and work in a team for the first time.
