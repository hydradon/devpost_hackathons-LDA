                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to techify baseball to give a new spin to a very old and classic sport!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using Google Cardboard, we are able to give VR/AR vision to anyone in the stands. We provide a HUD while you watch the baseball to be able to push events out and show enhanced data about the game, and when the software detects a special marker we provide a transition to a VR world.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                    Vuforia, Unity, Python, Love, and Friendship

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Getting all the web sockets to work, and improving the computer networking between devices. The front end/VR stuff was easy peezy!
                </p>
