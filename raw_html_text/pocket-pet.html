                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the Viacom presentation when the presenter talked about tamagotchi. It reminded me how much fun it was having a virtual animal to feed and take care of, so I made Pocket Pet!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You choose what kind of dog you want, name him/her, and give him food as his/her stomach gets empty. It's real time so it takes a bit for him/her to get hungry. Currently you can only buy Bones as food but there will be more food items in the future!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On eclipse with Java. I have experience building 2D game engines
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of bugs with the mouselisteners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created my own buttons and textboxes for user input. I also am proud of my settings and save handlers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too much to say it all. How to make GUI components from scratch. Tricks for 2D game development. Organization. Image IO use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pocket Pet!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Complete the store. Have a WorkState in which you do tasks (complete mini games) to get money that you can use to buy  food. Also, I want to implement Idle-RPG design to allow the user to make money off of his/her pet while he/she is offline.
