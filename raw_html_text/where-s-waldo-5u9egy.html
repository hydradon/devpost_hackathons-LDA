                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>

                    Finds if Waldo is in an image or not.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Custom Vision connected it to my program using C#.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API was really bad and I was not able to figure out if Waldo was in the image or not using the predictions.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    A lot about how to get around faulty API's as well as how to connect a program to an online project.
