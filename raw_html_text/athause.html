                    Bank At Hause &ndash; Factor Xchange (BAH-FX) is a digital ecosystem developing cost effective mechanisms that advance financial inclusion in various sectors of local economies in the developing world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A case in point is agriculture and manufacturing sectors. About thirty percent of the value in Uganda&rsquo;s agricultural supply chain between farmers and consumers is lost to rot, insects, birds and other pests. (Estimates range from twenty to forty percent.) Many attempts have been made to reduce these post-harvest losses, but almost all have failed because they aim directly at changing the behavior of small farmers, who are well known for their conservatism and their resistance to changes pressed on them by organizations that are not directly involved in the supply chain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bank At Hause  Factor Xchange selectively financing wholesalers to purchase farm produce. The solution pulls agricultural produce that is packed in insect and rot resistant three ply bags through the supply chain, ensuring superior financial returns to farmers, small traders, and to the wholesalers themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Direct customers are millions of small farmers who are widely dispersed, and a few retailers and wholesalers especially exporters who are geographically concentrated, stable businesses, known to BAH-FX investors and banks, and well connected to their customers.
Indirect customers are consumers. And the small traders who distribute 3-ply bags to the farmers and find ready buyers with the BAH-FX-financed wholesalers.
