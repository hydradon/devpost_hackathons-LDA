                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all passionate about athletics, and we're determined to create Website to ensure proper communication between players, coaches, and college coaches. We also want to encourage more young people to consider college sports.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ex. A coach makes an account and a team. Players make accounts and are able to join the team that their coach made. There are player/coach profiles, events and reminders for things like practices, messages for further communication among teammates, and a team members section (in case college coaches are interested in certain players from certain teams).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The webpages weren't completely flush with another, and we had trouble with human interaction between the person and the computer (databases). We also struggled with linking the pages together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to determine the minimum amount of work to start the project, and by the end we were able to add more features than we thought we could.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned new elements of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and jQuery! We also learned that it's NOT the best idea to divide and conquer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Team Builder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand to all types of sports, right now we only have basketball. We also want to add college recruiting accounts/profiles to make the recruiting process easier.
