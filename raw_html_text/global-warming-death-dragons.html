                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game that would be fun and entertaining, but that also did some sort of social good. We thought that it would be effective to place the player into a fantasy world overrun with dragons and see how they dealt with the challenges that many face in trying to fight climate change, presented on a more exaggerated level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players face different text situations and are made to choose one of two options, that then lead them to a different situation based on their choice. Each storyline has a different ending, either with the world being destroyed, or in some cases, the player helping the world heal. After each finale, the player is redirected to a page describing how they can fight our dragon (climate change).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a team working on the choice functions in Java, while other members worked on the GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to be very careful about how our functions connected with each other to make sure that all the paths went to the correct place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all proud of how many storylines and metaphors we were able to create, and that we fulfilled our goal of making a socially conscious game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned what it's really like to work on a team like this, as it was most of our first Hackathon's. We also wrote our very first CSS style sheet!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Global Warming Death Dragons
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Global Warming Death Dragons can continue to expand forever with the addition of new storylines and challenges, and we all know that this isn't the end of our story.
