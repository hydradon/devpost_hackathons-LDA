                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a C# .Net backend and connected it to a HTML5 Hybrid application for front end.
The backend is fully customizable and flexible to implement unlimited functionalities without boundries.
The mobile application is available for iOS and Android.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a challenge for us to analyze an image caught from camera or file input and process it on the phone.
We solved that by sending the photo to the backend and do the heavy lifiting server side.

                <p>
                    Image analyzation is an accomplishment that i'm proud of.
This is a feature that is handy for most fishermen to categorize their catch.
