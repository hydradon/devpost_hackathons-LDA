                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by seeing videos of AI powered simulations doing cool things, such as parking in a full parking lot:

                    What it does

                    Crashes into walls and drives off the edge of the world

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trial and error

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a difficult time getting the reward function correct and tuning the hyperparameters to allow the AI to learn. Although some of has have experience with supervised learning and machine learning for computer vision, we have never tried reinforcement learning before so all of the hyperparameters and details of the training were quite foreign
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the car to move in the general direction of the goal (sometimes).
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's also really cool to see the AI sometimes take advantage of glitches in the environment and phase through multiple obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reinforcement learning is difficult and not just a black box.
