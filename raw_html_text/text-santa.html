                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this skill was my 10-year old daughter.  We brainstormed fun ways she could use Alexa, and we came up with a way to keep track of the things she wants for Christmas. We put a fun spin on it so that kids can send Santa a "text" message and get a response back from Santa. Parents can even hear everything their kids have added to their Christmas list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Did you know that Alexa is good friends with Santa? Kids can use Alexa to quickly send a "text" message to Santa telling him what they want for Christmas. Santa adds the item to the Christmas list and sends a funny message back. Parents can even get involved by asking Alexa what's on the Christmas list.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this skill using a Lambda written in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am new to Python so the syntax of the language was a bit challenging. It was also hard for Alexa to understand words that weren't in the custom slot type.  We tested this a bunch and think we found a plausible solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that my daughter and I partnered together to create a skill.  She helped to come up with the idea and then I implemented it. She helped a lot with testing and identifying bugs.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about the AMAZON.LITERAL type and its shortcomings.

                <p>
                    My daughter will present Text Santa at the "Hour of Code" session we teach together at our local library as a way to get kids interested in Artificial Intelligence and building skills for Alexa.
