                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from pixel-arts, online games and having fun ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an online game in which you can draw your own Pixeling and interact with other Pixelings (players). Game chat and other features still need to be implemented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was 3 am and we didn't know what to do, we were tired. Then suddenly we came up with an idea of making this game. We were very excited and started developing straight away.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to build an application from scratch and come up with basic game features. It took quite a while - that was the main challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of presenting our game in it's beta state, hosted on Google Cloud Platform. We believe that this game can deliver great fun to it's users.
It turns out that it is a lot of fun to draw you own character and play around with it.

                    <li>
                        We learned to work together more efficiently.

                    <li>
                        We learned that Java is sometimes easier to use as a server than nodejs.
