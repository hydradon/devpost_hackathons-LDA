                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As human beings, we all physically live in a 3D world. However, our content are mostly constrained in the 2D space. From TangoFLIR, we are trying to solve this problem by having the image overlayed on top of the depth information. By doing that, user will have more information, and experience the content with true 3D.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We take Project Tango device and connect a FLIR one camera on it. Using Tango's tracking and mapping, and FLIR one thermal imaging technology. We can reconstruct the 3D scene realtime.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a micro USB extension coord, it doesn't work on the device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We achieved the thermal scanning feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about thermal imaging, how it works and the theory behind this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tango FLIR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think i will add couple more features into it and make it as a public open sourced project
