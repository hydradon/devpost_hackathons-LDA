                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help students and their respective colleges with building schedules. College requires a lot of time and resources, so anything that can let us focus on studies more is a big plus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oracle Stone, our schedule building program, simplifies the schedule building process by showing a major's required classes. They then pick the classes they want to take based on their needs and it creates a schedule for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using PHP, with some CSS, Oracle Stone is a 4-page website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The strain of time made us panic a lot more than we needed to. However, we came together and pulled through in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning PHP and CSS together as a team. Originally, there was one person on our team who had light experience with PHP; now, every member of our team has better learned both languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to overcome obstacles as a team. Each member had their own strengths that helped teach the other's to overcome his weaknesses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Oracle Stone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to automate the schedule building program to where it will only take the classes they want, and the program will automatically build a schedule for you. It will also be editable to fit their preferences.
