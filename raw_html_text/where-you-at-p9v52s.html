                    facilitates meet-ups by allowing you to easily request or send a snapshot of your location with a friend. After creating an account, users can search other users by username, and create rooms. Once a room has been established, The user is greeted with 2 buttons, one that asks for their location, and another that sends yours. When sending location data, it uses

                        Magnet Messaging
                    </em>
                    to shoot over a single packet with the latitude, longitude and the timestamp with which the other user can then use to draw on a map. The app also uses Google Maps API to tell you how long it would take to walk or to drive from your location to his/hers.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the google maps sdk and Magnet Messaging as the backend, and used standard Java and Android Studio for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Magnet Message did not have any user authentication caching, so I had to build that myself.
Also, there is no way to see past user-to-user messages, and query all of the user's current rooms with other users, so my work around was to make each conversation a public forum with the usernames as the tags, so that I could then query for any forums with the current username as a tag. The current implementation is a little hacky with security holes, but with the sdk provided by Magnet Messaging, it was the only way. The forum had to be public because private forums could not be queried via tags (which I use to store usernames).
When "Send Location" is pressed, two messages get sent. one to the other user directly to allow push notifications, and another to the public forum for archiving the conversation history.

                <p>
                    I'm proud of the UI and UX, and the customisation of google maps. I am also proud of the workarounds that I used on the Magnet Message sdk.
