                <p>
                    The financial services provided by the banks are completely centralized and one has to trust the central system provided. This can also be done using a decentralized peer to peer system which is faster and secure.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the truffle framework and solidity compiler for creating and building the smart contracts. We made use of Infura 3rd party Full Node for deploying the smart contract to the Ethereum Blockchain. We followed a few tutorials and some projects to get some technical help.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few challenges. 
1.The first and foremost challenge was to come up with this idea of peer to peer lending system which can not only be used to provide loan, but can also be used as donations during natural calamity in a fast, secure and easy manner.

                    <li>
                        The next challenge that we still have to figure out is on how to verify a collateral provided by the borrower.
