                    This is an android application that focuses on optimizing your efficiency in the real world. It bridges the gap between the complex technologies and the infinite mind of the user. It allows the user to capture and convince themselves that they are actually being more productive than they are. Mayhaps without the use of this app, the user might be more productive than without.
                </p>

                    We tried to combine and Todolist and a countdown timer to allow the user to track time more efficiently. Attempted to use and explore the Model View Presenter pattern.
