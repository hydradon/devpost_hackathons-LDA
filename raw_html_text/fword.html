                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once in a while, one sees an emergency vehicle he mistreated on the streets. Often they must cross perpendicular to the traffic flow and this slows them down. When in an emergency, every minute counts. Because of this, we decided that this would be a great hack to present at UOttaHack, since Ottawa is the capital of a caring society known as Canada.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FWORD aims to inform intersections and it users of the impending presence of an emergency vehicle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript and Google Maps to build this wonderful web application. We began by making components separately, however, we quickly learned that working together to create our projects made us more cohesive as a team and produced better qualities of code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several challenges. One of them, a formidable opponent, was the Google Maps API. However, once we got the hang of it, the API proved to be a great tool, so much so that we did not need another one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we managed to accomplish this task. We faced several debugging challenges which required solutions that we are proud to have come up with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, everyone learned something. The more skilled members of the group gained experience and learned new tricks of the trade. Meanwhile, those who did not have much experience with hackathons, learned that they are a great source of knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for fword
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have no idea what is next for fword. We hope that this technology improves our collective qualities of life.
