                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about creating a game that we thought we could enjoy and remembered how people might like to play a text adventure game to bring them back to their childhood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an interactive story where the choices you make in the game determine the plot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it using Java, we used if, else if, and if statements to control the flow of the story, we created different methods to call upon code that we would use again if needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew very little about Java, we had to learn a lot of new things. Another challenge we faced was figuring out a way so that if the user entered an option that didn't exist the program would get stuck so we had to figure out a way to fix this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a text adventure with a deep plot without any pre-existing knowledge of Java. We also figured out a way so if the user made a mistake they could continue with the game without restarting the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to declare variables, create classes and methods, conditional statements, looping, output text, and scan for new input in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Text Adventure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extending the story, more options for the player, a leveling up system, an inventory system, a way to track health, spacing out intervals when lines are printed to make it easier to read, quests, and multiple beginnings (choosing your class).
