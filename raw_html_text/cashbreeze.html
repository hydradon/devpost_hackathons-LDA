                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I sat and thought why cant I pay a market woman with my master card . Oh her business is too small to have access to a POS. Maybe She does not even have a bank account.There is a gap between her and me I thought to myself. So we decided to build a solution that bridge such gaps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution provides a middle ground for everyone to carry out seamless, efficient transactions with each other regardless of what their level of access to financial services are. For example, someone could have access to all modern financial services, but would still have to carry cash around due to the fact that he would definitely have to carry out transactions with the unbanked/underbanked. Our solution seeks to address this issue, in turn addressing the problem of financial inclusion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to build a system that meets everyone at their own scale. Our solution is accessible through :-
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            USSD - very important part of our system for reaching the digitally excluded people mostly unbanked.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Web Application - more robust application for internet enabled users
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Desktop java app - for our big merchants who would love to receive payment via fingerprint from their customers who are registered on cashbreeze
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            APIs - For our merchants, fintechs and other financial Industry players to integrate with us (hereby allowing our customers gain access to their modern services like lending)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Top Use cases
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Offline creation of online available payment pages through ussd. With this I can now pay a market woman with my card or bank account or an other modern payment channel through her payment page.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Giving our users access to modern financial services by providing their transaction data upon their authorisation to financial players like lendtech. This goes a long way for the unbanked, who usually have no transaction record, And are left to suffer in the hands of cooperative societies with their high interest rate.
                        </p>
