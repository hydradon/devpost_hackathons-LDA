                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are either that person or know the person who hates watching horror movies, so we wanted to devise something that would make watching horror movies more bearable, targeting jump scares specifically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application accesses the jumpscares times of some movies and warns the user a few moments before with a vibration and notification the jumpscare occurs, and also provides a description of what to expect. This way users can either avoid watching that moment or be caught less off-guard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a web scraper to gather the data from the website and stored the necessary information into a Firebase database. From our React application, we called the movie from the database based on the user's input, and as the user starts the timer, the application will use a timer to send notifications when appropriate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard getting the notifications to trigger at the appropriate time frame and also making sure that the user can start and stop in moments and not throw off the accuracy of the notification times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get notifications to trigger on time and accurately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using version control to collaborate and consolidate all of our work. Communicating well and utilizing React-native for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Peek-A-Boo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to deploy this application to the App store, and also expand the number of movies available for users to watch.
