                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 45th President and his love for Twitter.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Markov Chains and
                    <strong>
                        ALL
                    </strong>
                    of Donald Trump's Tweets as input. We generate new tweets that are similar to what Trump would actually say.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made our backend using NodeJS and express, and HTML/CSS/Jquery for the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing the front-end of the application took longer than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking some NodeJS libraries that none of us have used before and implementing them without much issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went into this project with no knowledge of Markov Chains, and now we have the capability to implement them.
                </p>

                    What's next for MC Donald
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to take what we learned about generating Markov Chains and apply it to more complex data, such as banking.
