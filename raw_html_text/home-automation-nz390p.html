                    In this project, we will be using ESP8266 12e manufactured by Lolin to make a Chatbot that can control our home applications. To chat with our chatbot, we will use Facebook messenger platform. Also, we will integrate some AI into our chatbot using Chatfuel. It will then be integrated with IFTTT and Adafruit IO. Adafruit IO is linked to our ESP8266 at the hardware side. In a gist, the output pins of ESP8266 will be controlled through our Facebook Messenger Chatbot.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    It was our first hackathon  me and team supported each other for this project.
we finished this project by our team work. 
People can use our project in the future automation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The home automation system has been experimentally proven to work satisfactorily by connecting sample appliances to it and the appliances were successfully controlled from a wireless mobile device. We learned many skills such as soldering, wiring the circuit and other tools that we use for this project and was able to work together as a team during this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Home Automation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are entering an era in human history where the cheapest computer costs $9 and your kindergartener just used an Arduino to water the plants.
The Internet of Things has become one of the hottest topics in tech and everyone from Cisco to IBM to Microsoft has jumped on the bandwagon. The next phase for the Home automation market will occur based on a few key improvements in the technology available in Automation, such as improvement in Wireless Automation solutions as well as lowering of price points as the market begins to accept Home automation usage in larger volumes. Some trends that we foresee for this phase of the industry are
 Big companies like Philips, Siemens &amp; Schneider will eventually bring out fairly mass market automation products with appealing user interface but at a lower price point than today, and more people will be able to afford the products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution offerings will slowly move to a more user friendly design, where aside from a few key components, users will be able to buy and use the Automation products themselves without the aid of any technical expert. 
Here are several service model strategies that should be considered:
Implementation &amp; Monitoring  :-  We will provide a Smart Home solution, with a 24x7 professional monitoring service along with options for both broadband/Wi-Fi and cellular backup connections.
Smart Home Analytics :-  Consumers are growing more flexible to free apps, but by aggregating and processing the right kind of data from a unique combination of devices, a Smart Home-based analytics service could deliver insights, such as energy usage, valuable enough to warrant a monthly service fee. Premium analytical reports to the user can be provided, if a premium account is brought by the user.
Collaboration with an MNC :-  NodeMCU ESP8266 will be embedded with the finished product of the MNC and sold of to the user.
Warranty &amp; other Services :- 1 year assured warranty, and free service will be provided. Extended warrant &amp; free 24x7 home service can be brought by the users according to their will.
Collaboration with Gov Projects :- Since the product guarantees assured energy consumption, government projects can be managed.
Selling of prototype :- Prototype can be sold of to big MNC&rsquo;s on copyright issues.
