                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Me and my team mate coincidentally met at the Go club, in which I introduce him to the game of go. I taught him how to play the capturing game, which is one of the variation of the game of Go. This is a great game for a beginner to start. We then met, again, coincidentally at hackathon and decided to make a game we played yesterday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It plays the capturing game. two players share a screen and alternate the turn. When the winning condition is met, the game's background turns to white.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use MVC architecture to represent the game and implemented it with Java. I worked mainly on model and he mainly worked on views.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very hard to determine the win condition as it turns out to be a graph problem. We implemented it using DFS search.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have gui

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the game is indeed graph problem.
                </p>

                    What's next for Capture Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will implement the AI for the play. Also, it is interesting to implement it using machine learning.
