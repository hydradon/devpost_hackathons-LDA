                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by watching condensation forming on a computer cooling system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project produces water from the ambient air. This condensate can then be collected and filtered. The filtered water can be used to drip irrigate crops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are several parts to the hardware. First of all there is a solar panel which provides power for the whole unit. The cooling motors are mounted on aluminum cooling fins. The final component is the solid state Peltier panel that produces a temperature differential when a current is applied to it. That temperature difference is fairly large and causes condensation to form on the cooling fins to be collected and purified.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solar energy is notoriously unstable unless the area has a stable atmospheric pressure.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first time frost formed on the cooling fins and I realized the was getting too cold to produce water. Plugging in the entire project into he solar panel and having the motor running.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is more work to be done but being able to create water from ambient air is an exciting endeavor that deserves to be developed into a viable product that can be used around the world.

                    Possibly launching a crowdfunding project to reach more
