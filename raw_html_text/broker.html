                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted an app that combines stock articles from multiple sources to have easy access to all the data and a way to visualize it using graphs beyond the stock trends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gets stock articles from various news sources, rates them based on the number of positive and negative words, gets data from the top trending and slumping stocks, displays the buzzwords and corresponding articles for each stock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript to handle the backend and get the stocks and ratings from all the news sources and combined them into a JSON file that included company name, positive words, positive articles corresponding to the words, negative words, and negative articles corresponding to the negative words. We host this JSON file on Heroku, and the front-end gets the data from the JSON file and displays it visually and graphically. The website was built using HTML and CSS, and the word cloud uses d3.js to display all the buzzwords and list out the articles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to get the articles from each news source, as each website had a different structure, working with languages we weren't familiar with, trying to integrate the front end and the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although hosting the JSON on Heroku didn't quite work out, we were able to get everything completed using static data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data Parsing, UI, Web Crawling, HTTP requests
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Broker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more functionality and visualization so users can potentially also see the stock trends instead of just buzzwords and related articles.
