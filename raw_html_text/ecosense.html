                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our group attended HackDavis 2017 and we all got Raspberry-Pi's, so we wanted to do something with them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program senses and identifies color and combines that information with weather data to evaluate environmental wellness, but more specifically whether or not your lawn has enough water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Python and transferred the necessary files to a Raspberry-Pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was internet, but we many of us were inexperienced in using hardware and Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to connect a laptop to the Raspberry-Pi. Additionally, we were able to make a program that we are proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to extract data from online databases, navigate through the Raspberry-Pi interface, and persevere through adversities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EcoSense
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for EcoSense is to proceed with our original plan of connecting the Raspberry-Pi with a camera to get live data to fully automate the lawn care experience.
