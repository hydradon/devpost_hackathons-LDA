                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every term, we face the same problem of creating worklists with all the courses we need. Even when we do create a worklist, we often compromise and wonder if it truly is the best worklist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a list of courses, Worklistify will go through its course data and find you a list of sections that will minimize the amount of time spent at school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React in the front end to display data scraped from the UBC course site. We used node.js and express.js for the backend, with functionality such as scraping data and timetable creation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Finding the right framework to set up our project because we wanted to use many different tools for different functionality and had to compromise.
