                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In beginning to read philosophy, I and my team mates found ourselves overwhelmed by the different schools of thought and differences within same schools of thought. We have all seen many people be deterred from reading philosophy by this same overwhelming feeling and thought to make it easier for people to ease into the field of philosophy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes your personality using IBM Watson API, analyzes it, and uses those traits to give you a philosopher and school of thought to look into, as well as recommended books.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Node.js for the server, Jade for the front end, and IBM Watson API as well as our own algorithm for the logic.
                </p>
