                <p>
                    Inspired by the success of HQ, we were inspired to apply the same level concept that has drawn millions in order to test students outside of school in an engaging way! We built an app and streaming backend that mirrors the structure of a quiz app, with the teacher's camera recording them presenting the engaging show, with access to student analytics and full control of the 'show', playing the quasi-"Scott Rogowsky". We set up a custom NGINX server processing and transcoding a RTMP live stream from the teacher's phone, converting it to HLS, and beaming it down to the students running in an AWS EC2 instance with a custom flask server, as well as an iOS app for the frontend.
