                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make a simple game that implements the MiniMax Algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 24 hours, we tried to make a tic-tac-toe game with implementation of a MiniMax Algorithm that will get the AI to make smart moves that give it the best chance to win.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML， CSS， JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to have the game on website server that you can play the game with the AI. We were short on time so we couldn't implement on a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a learning experience working with new people for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learn a lot about working on a project with limited time. Planning and time management was a big problem we faced.
                </p>

                    What's next for Play Tic-tac-toe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to put it on a website and implement Augment Reality for a 3D experience to give the user a better experience playing a classic game.
