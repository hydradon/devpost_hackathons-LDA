                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was to bring awareness to a very big issue that is recently happening and has been going on for a while. What people don't realize is that ICE is breaking families up because of their status and detaining them in camps . This game and website was built to show people what's happening and give resources to those who need them. The point of the game is to show privileged people what immigrants are going through.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Breaking the ICE inspires people to make a movement and gives immigrants the resources they need and what they need to know.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the RenJS JavaScript framework to develop our game. We also used NGINX for the web server and Google Cloud Platform to host it all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Debugging RenJS proved to be difficult and learning how to use Google Cloud Platform was time consuming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of developing a game that raises awareness about ICE.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use RenJS, Git commands, NGINX, and Google Cloud Platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Breaking the ICE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whats next for breaking the ice: We want to try to keep people updated about resources to help those affected by ICE. We also want to build a community who will hopefully end this terrible thing.
