                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people in our lives are affected by mental health issues and getting help isn't always the easiest thing. We wanted to help create something that would help
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a platform that better connects the mental health support team to the patient. One of the ways to allow for this is to have daily sentiment tracking as well as have daily health metrics be delivered to their mental health practitioner and have reactive care happen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android application for the patient, web dashboard for therapists/psychologists, serverless REST api to connect the two.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the REST api to run was a challenge. And syncicng the two coded bases (android and web) proved difficult.
