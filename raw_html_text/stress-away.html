                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired simply through what we saw in our friends. Many of our friends suffered from stress, even contemplating suicide. We knew that as part of this community we needed to immediately make a change. Luckily, quinlan hacks gave us that opportunity.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is catered towards the users and guides the user step-by-step in helping them to free themselves from any form of stress they are facing. We provide them with multiple functionalities varying from recognizing nutritionally   acceptable foods to accurately detecting any mood swings that the user experiences. It provides the user with ways to keep track of timetables based on their different activities. We researched into multiple different causes of stress and realized that meditation was the best cure to stress. Consequently, we made a seperate page for different meditation techniques that the user could try in order to relieve their stress.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio, google vision, and vokaturi in order to create the android application. For the website we used jquery, css, and html.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges that we ran into were when we tried to get accurate reading for image recognition and also when we had to store user data to get the optimal results for the user.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of mastering image recognition and emotion detection using the Google Visions API in our android application. We are also proud of the impeccable UI we had created for the web application and the android application.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to to use various APIs from google such as the Google Vision API as well as the Google Calendar API. We also learned how to use Vokaturi, a machine learning emotion detection API using only a person&rsquo;s voice.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    If provided with more time, we would like to include accurate predictions to help users deal with unpredictable mood swings. We would also like to continue to improve the UI to promote a smoother experience for the users. We would also like the expand our existing database to promote healthier nutrition for the user and expand to other platforms such as IOS.
