                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of this hack-a-thon, we were quite indecisive ourselves in selecting a project idea. After going back and forth on this indecision, we realized: How much easier would all our lives be if some decisions were just made for us - especially, where to eat?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Food Finder only needs two pieces of information from the user in order to decide where that person should eat. Based on what the user is craving and where they are going, Food Finder uses Yelp's database to automatically generate a restaurant selection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Part of our group focused on developing the back-end and making sure that users could input data and receive a new restaurant selection each time. Our other members worked more on building the aesthetics of the website and implementing transitions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we are all relatively new at coding, the entire process began quite slowly, since we had to continuously Google things and try to figure out how everything works. Additionally, it was very confusing organizing Yelp's API to filter out the information we wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, we're proud that we did create a polished, minimalistic website that does what it was originally intended to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply put, we all learned a bit more about how to code. We came into this not knowing many languages or how programs could work, but through trial and error and our collaboration, we now have a greater understanding about and appreciation for web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Food Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we do continue with this project, we will definitely link the two sites (craving + location), refine the generated selections, and provide more filters ie. price, distance. Additionally, we had some issues with our code and the SVG files, so we will try to fix those errors and learn about new components we can add.
