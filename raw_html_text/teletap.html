                    Maternal mortality/death is unacceptably high. About 830 women die from pregnancy- or childbirth-related complications around the world every day. It was estimated that in 2015, roughly 303 000 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirth. Almost all of these deaths occurred in low-resource settings, and
                    <strong>
                        most could have been prevented

                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    In many poverty-stricken communities, women with complications face delays in deciding to seek care, getting to the appropriate health facility, and receiving treatment once they get there.

                    due to poverty or lack of a proper and reliable communication channel has greatly contributed to the rise in maternal mortality rate. This is what Inspired us to come up with

                    </strong>
                    is a simple gadget that connects
                    <strong>
                        maternal mothers
                    </strong>

                </p>
                <p>
                    The device is programmed with the mother's details and it is connected to relevant emergency response units and close relatives.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    The device is built using Internet of Things (IoT) technology using C++ programming language. We have a Mobile  App that is used to receive SMS notifications that is built using JAVA programming language.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Developing a hardware product is costly and time consuming. Also a deep feasibility study was done to ensure we have a product that will be acceptable by users.
