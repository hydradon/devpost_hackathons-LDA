                    It is no longer a secret that there is a lack of financial literacy among colleges and universities in the US. According to a study in [1], researchers found that 59% percent of college students would grade them C or below for financial management. Only 17 states require student to take finance courses, lack of basic knowledge of finance and confidence directly result in the fact that the current situation of college student financing is worrying. Even worse, higher tuition fees and continuous rise led to a increase in student debt as much as 74%, according to a Forbes study [2]. Hence, it is of vital importance to increase the financial capability for university students.
