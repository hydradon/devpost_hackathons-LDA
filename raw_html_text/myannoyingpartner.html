                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found the inspiration to build this project when we were always dozing off while doing work and getting distracted from work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MyAnnoyingPartner uses opencv to sense the user's facial landmarks through the laptop camera and determines if the user is looking away (left and right) from the laptop screen or falling asleep. After passing a certain threshold value it reminds the user to stay on track. Try our python application to find out more!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt opencv and pygame through online tutorials and a lot of stackoverflowing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we faced troubles with setting up the project's dependencies. Also faced difficulties with calibrating the threshold for the eye detection code as it was hard for the camera to detect our pupils.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning and implementing an application using opencv and pygame within a short period of 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for MyAnnoyingPartner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can reduce the load on the computer through optimising the application further and make further improvements to create a more seamless experience for the user.
