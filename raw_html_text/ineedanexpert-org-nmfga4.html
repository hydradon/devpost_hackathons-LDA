                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major obstacle between people who want to learn and those who can teach is communication. The knowledge can't be shared without some kind of platform to connect the two ends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                    provides this platform by matching people who are searching for a teacher with others that can provide this teaching. It initiates a video call between the two and allows any questions that are asked to be answered promptly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend is built using php which connects to a mysql database. Our entire backend is running on Amazon Web Services which was a pleasure to use. The frontend is written with vanilla html, css, and javascript. Our video calling system is built on top of OpenTok.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The OpenTok library ended up being very feature rich, meaning it took us some time to get to grips with it.
