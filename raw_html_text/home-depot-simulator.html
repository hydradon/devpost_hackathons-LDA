                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zack and I we're talking to the various sponsors at the event and were already sold on building a game. When we heard about Home Depot's challenge, we felt it left us enough creative room to create a memorable experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, it's more of a proof of concept. It can be built upon easily, however we simply did not have the time or resources to build it out the way we wanted to. So as a result, this is a prototype of a potential final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Unity, Photoshop, Pixilart, and a healthy dose of Google Docs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was originally going to be built on Android device, but due to technical difficulties, that idea had to be pushed to the side. As a result, this was built as a game for MacOS, with the resolution set to match that of a mobile phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was Zack's first time working as the primary artist on a game, and was also his first time working in 2D pixel art for a game. This was Kat's first time building the script by themselves, especially one so reliant on it's UI. This was Chris' first time working on UI design, and Billy's first time making art assets for a game. Overall, we put in great work for a team that stepped out of their comfort zone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned the importance of good and effective communication, as well as asking others for help when needed. A lot of our members had experience in other fields that they weren't working in, so it was good to have someone to bounce ideas off of.
                </p>

                    What's next for Home Depot Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A full game hopefully.
