                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were fed up with the terrible customer service provided by major financial services companies.

                    <strong>
                        CardBot
                    </strong>
                    asks the user questions and assists in the creation of an account, then identifies relevant credit card products.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used wrapper class to access Facebook messenger and make creative responses to user inputs.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The _ wifi _  was spotty so we were forced to try several times. Additionally, the API documentation was not very effective, so at times it was very difficult to decipher different functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a fully functional
                    <strong>
                        chatbot
                    </strong>
                    that was integrated with the _ Capital One API _ to build customers, credit cards, and loan products.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even simple ideas take time. Different team members have unique perspectives that must be considered, no matter how far-fetched they seem because there is always hope.
                </p>

                    What's next for CardBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to develop a more advanced version with higher level functionalities when the relevant _ APIs _ are updated and can support more significant actions.
