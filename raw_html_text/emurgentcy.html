                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first thought for this project came up after watching the movie Taken to start off the hackathon. It seemed like a reoccurring theme in movies such as this where someone gets kidnapped and thrown in a trunk they get stripped down of everything besides their jewelry which brought forth this idea. Being able to send messages with a location without having to physically touch your phone. It could also be used for everyday hassles such as possibly locking your phone in your car, losing your phone at a party or a big event etc.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Send the location of you phone to preset emergency contacts. The user has the choice to make it an urgent message or a non urgent message
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end in its entirety was made with Javascript, and the backend was made with a little bit of Javascript and some Twilio implementation.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pebble supports C which is what I originally used to start programming the application but things got really messy, really quick.

                    What's next for Emurgentcy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to pick contacts instead of having them prepicked already (Andriod), and possibly using three primary buttons on the pebble to send custom messages on the fly.
