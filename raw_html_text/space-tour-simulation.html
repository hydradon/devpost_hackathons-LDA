                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our group members' experiences in astronomy and research to do data visualiztion with astronomy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is like a "Google Maps" for space flight. Currently, it displays Earth and Mars. Our project can successfully calculate the orbits of these planets and the trajectory and date of launch needed to get there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the frontend with React js. The astronomers on our team computed the orbits of planets in the solar system and translated this Python. We also served all of this through a backend in Python with Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were challenged greatly by simulations and apis. We are very close to getting a working simulation, but are not quite there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a functional backend that calculates the orbits of Earth and Mars
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate on a project within a short time frame and under pressure. We also learned a great deal about connecting React with backend services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Space Tour Simulation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we plan on fully connecting the backend with the front end to get a successful simulation of interplanetary flight. We also hope to add the orbits of more planets with additional modes of transportation technologies, such as those currently being researched by leading space research companies.
