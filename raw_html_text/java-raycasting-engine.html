                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to create a three dimensional game from scratch and learn how basic 3d graphics worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simulates 2d scene and raycasts from the player/camera over many angles in their field of view. Uses the distances from the player to determine how tall the wall should be at that x-coordinate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created two iterations of the program in order to make it faster and condense multiple classes together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some walls continue infinitely while others are cut short. Movement behaves unpredictably when player's coordinates are outside of the first quadrant. Finding a way to represent the map in a way that is understood by the program was difficult. The camera has a constant fish eye distortion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extremely lightweight with 235 lines of code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basics of raycasting. Recursive flood fill algorithms (in first iteration). Implementation of key listeners in java. Integrating many classes together (in first iteration).
                </p>

                    What's next for Java Raycasting Engine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fix fisheye distortion, input issues, and wall rendering issues. Add gameplay mechanics to the engine.
