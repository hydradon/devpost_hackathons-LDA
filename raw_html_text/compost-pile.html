                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from the amount of ignorance and laziness that goes into recycling and waste. Majority of the time, while we do care about the environment, it is just easier to throw away the apple core in the recycling, or the plastic bottle in the recycling. Doing this is not just hazardous to the environment, but also to human health. But what is easier than throwing it alway in one bin and having the bin separate it.

                    Currently, it manages the waste produced by a household and recommends decisions on how to reduce the amount of waste that you produce. Informs you on how you measure up against other compost file users. How your waste reduction is improving the environment. Informs you what isn't okay to throw away in the trash can, we want it to sort your trash.

                <p>
                    We started off discussing ideas, designing it and tried my very best to recreate our designs.  Using, swift, XML, and js. We built a prototype of the app and worked on the

                <p>
                    One, ios is not what I normally create.Two neither is the front end. I'm all for Android and backend! Normally, if I do a hackathon I'm working with other developers. Or even UX, UI designers. But, since this was my teams first hackathon. None, of them, had techie skills. I was rowing the boat. Debugging, was a bit of a nightmare on both ends! Lately, I had been trying to improve my ios skills and my phone having some issues. I decided to make an app that would be compatible with a functioning device.

                    I'm certainly proud that we were able to handle the front and backend of the app and create something that sort of functions in such a limited amount of time. Not to mention, most of us were running on 4 hours of sleep!

                <p>
                    I learned a lot of things about front-end designing and formatting and taking charge of a project as a leader, or someone with greater experience. It's a lot of pressure.
