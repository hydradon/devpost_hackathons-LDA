                <h2>
                    Everyone goes through major crush and heartbreaks. Keeping to ponder over it can be excessively time and energy confusing, thus preventing one to move forward. Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you wanted to get over someone but you couldnt stop stalking this person and feel more sad. Here is your chance to temporarily block someone from your life, all at once, so that you can move on and the resume conversation when you are ready.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It asks the user to sign in through social networks like Twitter, Facebook etc and asks the person he/she wants to unfollow. It unfollows on your behalf. Have no self control? Even better! Our app will charge you everytime in dollars, more in the magnitude of the sentiment score of how the other person made you feel. It works as a negative reinforcement for people to slow down your engagement with people who are meant to be left behind.
