                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cohesive information on accessibility is difficult to access. Disabled people often try to go places only to find that they can't find the accessibility options they need. Many locations provide accessibility options but there is no universal platform for displaying accessibility options for some geographic region.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app allows users to upload and view accessibility options (such as ramps, sharps disposal, lifts, etc) in the areas near them. When users upload, they describe the location and type of accessibility option. Other users viewing these locations can upvote or downvote based on the accuracy of information. Locations belong to the user who first uploads it. Users accumulate reputation based on upvotes given to the locations they upload creating an incentive system for users to continue to come back and use.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the MERN stack for most of the application. For servers, we used Google Cloud for both the MongoDB server and the Express server. We used MaterialUI for the frontend as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots. Trying to figure out how MongoDB and Express work since we have never used either.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn a lot of cool technologies and overcome hurdles we ran into. Some parts of our application started to work as we planned, which was an amazing feeling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MERN stack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Accessibility.alt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We might continue to build on it or rebuild it individually for personal coding projects since it was a really cool idea that we didn't get to flesh out as fully as we would have liked to.
