                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People who love to travel, or are looking for another place sometimes do not have time to make their own food. They often rely on eating out, but some cities have a better culture of health than others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rates a city based on the average health of its restaurants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Google Places API, we utilized dynamic autocomplete searching to allow users to easily find their city. We used Zomato api for finding the restaurants and descriptions in the cities. We used PHP to interact with the APIs and Javascript, largely using JQuery, to handle the business logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -JSON as it exists between third party APIs, PHP, and Javascript
-Issues with formatting in trying to produce good design
-Initial issues with choice of technology stack
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning more about PHP and web development in general
Having a project that exists to a good level of completion
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how important it is to understand the concepts behind whatever it is you may be building. Ideas are nothing if they can't be executed and a situation around that had us switch our stack mid hackathon. We're glad that happened, because it allowed us to have a much better and productive time at HackBU!
