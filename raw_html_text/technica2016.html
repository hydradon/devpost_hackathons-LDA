                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to learn how to use OpenCV on
                    <strong>
                        real-time
                    </strong>
                    videos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can draw with your finger on the webcam stream in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the python OpenCV library with the help of many tutorials out there about detecting hand gestures with OpenCV.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to originally train an OpenCV cascade to detect a pointing hand as an object instead of using background subtraction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although it's not what I first envisioned, I'm proud that I've learned some things about OpenCV. I was pleasantly surprised of how easy it was to be able to stream the webcam feed onto an OpenCV window.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about some different techniques of detection in images, although my attempts of using them were not very successful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for So You Think You Can Draw
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps include learning more about OpenCV to be able to make smoother curves and not need to be limited by background subtraction.
