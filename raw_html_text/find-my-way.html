                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took inspiration from the faces of lost freshman when they arrive at this daunting school. We decided to make their lives easier and please their teachers.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Find My Way is an app that gives new students a path to follow to arrive at their classes on time in Montgomery High School.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Find My Way as an Android app. We made it using Dijkstra's algorithm in java, and XML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order solve for the path between two classes, we had to implement Dijkstra's algorithm.  However, we made some mistakes along the way and were unable to finish due to an error while compiling the nested for loops, when we run through the graph's distances Hence, we have used the algorithm such that it finds the distance from a room to one constant room. In other words, the distance of a root node to all the other nodes, and print the results when compiled.

                <p>
                    Making the thing actually fully functional, and also supporting an efficient traversal for any school if given a graph representation of the school's map.
