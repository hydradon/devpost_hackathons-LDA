                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all keen to work on drones and to control its movement with hand gestures. The android app was a way to utilize our skills to meet our objectives.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The shaking of the android device fires up the drone. Thereon, the device works as a joystick to control the movement and the elevation of the drone can be changed using the buttons on the application screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The drone was hard to work with mainly because after an hour and a half of charging it, the battery only lasted for less than 8 minutes. This meant that we could only test it a limited number of times, and had to be certain of our code. We couldnt afford to make careless mistakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how we have managed to control the drone. When we started working on it, the drones movements were unpredictable to say the least.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to program without having the luxury to test as you please. In addition to this, we polished our understanding of android development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Maybe more polishing and open source distribution.
