                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired us to create Ka-bomb.com was that we were playing bomber man with 4 players and suddenly we thought "what if there were 256 players?" and that is how this was born.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After having enjoyed some Bomberman early on with the Nintendo Switch, we wondered about the possibility of taking the game to a large scale in ways that games like agar.io and slither.io have previously explored.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ka-bomb.com allows players to play a light clone of Bomberman online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using C# for the backend server and jQuery + HTML5 for the frontend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript was a challenge in and of itself - chunking a massive grid was a major issue. Additionally, we needed this to work with a variety of triggers (opcodes) in the backend, which made up most of the latter half's work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Socket programming is awkward, so making it work was rewarding. Also making the player move around the map was a lot harder than expected - while it was relatively straightforward in concept, implementing it from a frontend perspective and then making that work with the backend made it a major challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of jQuery and HTML5 as well as how to interact with a server in the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ka-Bomb.com
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A version created for 4096 players. Let total chaos happen! Ka-Bomb.com could be scaled majorly, and could also include its own take on some powerups from the Bomberman series, earning its own name in a way not too far from Rivals of Aether (a Super Smash Bros. inspired fighting game).
