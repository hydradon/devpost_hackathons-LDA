                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used to feel very tired of memorizing things, thinking about my goals. I have thought of doing many things, but without writing it down, I could not get anywhere. I felt quite lost in life, with everything jumbled and piling on top of me as one big heap. Eventually, I brought myself a notebook, and I have used a few planners and/or notebooks to jot down a few notes, and goals. Eventually, I thought that it would be very interesting and helpful if I can fuse technology and notes together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This virtual notebook serves a very helpful purpose: To keep notes, and track down everything you need. We made it have a somewhat user-friendly interface that we can incorporate our notes, and ideas into an online notebook. We know that today, many people use technology for almost well,everything. So, we decided to make this an online tool that you can use to keep your notes in one place. This way, it is highly accessible, and also might be a very helpful tool for the world someday.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges that we encountered was the functionality of the buttons. We had difficultly getting the add button to add something to the list, getting the remove buttons to appear next to each goal, and crossing out the words when you pressed them

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are especially proud of being able to edit the entered goals. While it was difficult to do, we were able to allow the user to edit what they entered after they pressed add.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to store attributes into an array, and we also learned to remove items from an array. We also learned to sharpen our skills with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Goals Notebook
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If I want to make the Goals Notebook into an application to be sold, I would have to create a landing page in order to get people interested and a login page in order to save and store individuals' data. I would also create a calendar that shows the month you are currently in and the progression towards your goals. If you go back, you can also see your previous progressions.
