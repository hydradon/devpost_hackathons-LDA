                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into this Hackathon, our main goal was to create a product of utility that serves the disabled. We brainstormed past ideas involving machine learning and resulting in a more passively helpful product; however, we wanted to be more direct in our aid and focused on improving emergency services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iNotify is a device that works to detect possible instances of heart attack, seizures, and other debilitating health issues. Our device is intended to be used as a fashion accessory that will record any sudden movement that may indicate danger to one's health. The accelerometer detects movement and responds to another system if a certain acceleration threshold is met or exceeded. Then, authorities and the user's loved ones are informed via phone call and text message (respectively) with all available details.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an arduino uno and an accelerometer to detect acceleration in hand movement. If the acceleration crossed the certain value, then a javascript file would send an email to the phone provider which, in turn, would send a text to the user's chosen emergency contact. In case of a faulty alert, the user can push a button that cancels the text system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only did we have little experience in javascript, we also weren't aware of how we were going to set up the email to text gateway.
                </p>

                    Using javascript and integrating the texting system.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add a small sound alarm to notify the user of the text generation in case of a false alarm.
