                    is an interpreter for a turing-complete programming language loosely based off of brainfuck based on Spotify playlists. It is

                <p>
                    The interpreter reads the playlist from the top down. Various attributes of the song, sorted in terms of importance, defines the behaviours of the songs. The data land is a list of 40000 bytes, which can be navigated through with a pointer. From top down, the songs evaluate to:
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Print Character
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Any song from RADWIMPS' album
                    <code>
                        Your Name.
                    </code>
                    prints the character at the pointer location.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Input Character
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Any song by Coldplay grabs input from
                    <code>
                        stdin
                    </code>
                    depending on the number of letters in the first word of the song. For example, A Sky Full of Stars will take only the first letter of whatever input is in
                    <code>
                        stdin
                    </code>
                    and write it to the location of the pointer. However, Yellow will take the first six letters of
                    <code>
                        stdin
                    </code>
                    and write it, starting at the pointer location. The pointer stays at its position befure the input is called.

                    Any song by Radiohead moves a pointer forward by

                        1
                    </code>
                    byte, while any song by Green Day moves a pointer back
                    <code>
                        1
