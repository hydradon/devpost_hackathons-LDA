                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It always sucks to run out of controllers when playing games with your friends, but now thanks to Totality the smartphones everyone has in their pocket can become a controller!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Totality is a game engine framework that abstracts the use of ANY web socket enabled device (that's most smartphones and tablets) to become a controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a server in Java that implements the web socket protocol, as well as a Javascript client. We then connected these two pieces and built an API on top of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the layout correct on every device was a great challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the web socket protocol from scratch in Java with no web socket libraries was a challenge, but we managed to complete it in the end with no problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grant had no experience with javascript before today, and Tommy learned the web socket protocol in and out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Totality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to not only add more features to totality, but to also make games using the engine!
