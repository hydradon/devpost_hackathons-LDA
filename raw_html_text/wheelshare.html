                    WheelShare is a web application which we came up with because of the experiences we had recently in Houston due to Harvey.
One of our friend got stuck there as she didn't have a car and couldn't find ride back.
This inspired us to come up with an idea which will help people connect with each other to get to places by sharing rides.
There are a lot of people who don't have car or their car brakes down or they run out of fuel. 
Through this web application one can go anywhere anytime by sharing a car without or with minimal expense.
Like in case of emergencies , distasters this web application comes handy.
