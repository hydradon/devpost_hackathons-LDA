                    Hiren's bootcd. We decided to make the life of IT professionals a little easier by making a easily configurable GUI for TronScript, which is a an open source batch suite used for cleaning and disinfecting computers. The script includes features like rkill, mbam, TDSSKiller, Stinger, registry backup, WMI repair, sysrestore clean, oldest VSS set purge, create pre-run System Restore point, SMART disk check, NTP time sync, etc.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    We built it in java using JFrames and the swift library.
