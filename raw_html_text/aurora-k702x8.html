                    . This means, that for every $100 spent, only $60-70 (sometimes lower or higher) is actually getting to the cause.

                <p>
                    NPOs are continuing to seek more and more capital, but there is little evidence indicating that "just simply giving more" is necessarily going to create bigger change faster in the world. To the contrary, one should be weary of the effects that influxes of money have had in the past on organizations. In the for profit world, more money generally means hiring more people, assembling more committees and producing slower results and with an aggressively tedious bureaucratic processes.

                    On the other extreme, capital constraints in the world of technology and venture capital have surprisingly continued to breed unicorn status level companies in record time.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aurora is a Charity exploration and Performance Escrow service. It allows would be donors to find their ideal charities, honestly assess their execution level, and make decisions about whether or not to join in funding the cause.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Performance Escrow concept is the key, in that like a traditional escrow account funds are not released until both party's fulfill their duties to the arrangement. Aurora's performance escrows act much like Bountry contracts as they incentivize a certain behaviour by restricting a pool of cash until a set objectives or expected target efficiency is reached. At which point, charities are free to redeem funds from the
                    <code>
                        PerformanceEscrow
                    </code>
                    contract and build their cause.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aurora is built using Ethereum, and Solidity, using the Truffle DApp framework with use of React, Redux, and UPort.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Primarily, working in the decentralized world of computer, programming is slightly more difficult and abstract. Unfortunately, towards the end, amazing features such as UPort integration and Redux auth, had to be removed (for demo purposes) as they we're failing to cooperate.
