                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to build this web app when I witnessed a high school freshman being bullied by a bunch of seniors. When I saw the hopelessly confused look on his face, I knew that he and others like him could benefit from such a service.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TinyHub is an online forum where kids experiencing social difficulties in their life can chat and recieve support from their peers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this web app using Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime, MongoDB, a database service, and Twitter Bootstrap, a front-end framework optimized for mobile development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of challenges that I had to struggle through to get my app to even work. I had a lot of trouble with the spotty internet connection not letting me connect to my database. Also, I found it difficult to implement a proper login system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very proud of my web app because I had to debug a lot of different aspects of it. For example, when working with Bootstrap, I would get very frustrated when an element wouldn't display exactly the way I wanted it to. After a bit of work (and a lot of Stack Overflow), however, I eventually figured out how it works out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of things at Los Altos Hacks, and the best part is that not all of them have to do with coding. I learned a lot of life skills, such as the importance of good planning, staying calm under pressure, and never giving up, no matter what.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TinyHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, when I started developing TinyHub, I didn't want to deploy it onto the internet, but now that I have worked on it for a long time, I think that my app can actually help people. I definitely want to improve on this, and maybe put it on the internet for real.
