                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that credit debt has been mismanaged over the last few years and that there is a better solution to  this.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sinq brings together all your debts to one place and allows you to assess the best way to begin repayment. It also allows for an algorithm to process the best way to pay off your debt.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a react-native front end so we could serve as many users as possible with a node js backend to allow for greater security. We then leveraged Plaid's banking API to access user's liabilities and gauge the best method to solve their debt.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As many of us are new to web development, we found that there was a lot of learning to be done. We spent a lot of the hackthon trying to get a prototype running with Plaid's API and although we were unsuccessful in doing so, we were able to simulate a successful account.
                </p>

                    We hope to continue working on this after the hackathon.
