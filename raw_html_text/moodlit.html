                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You want your living space to represent you completely. With MoodLit, even your lighting will literally reflect you at any given moment. We wanted to design a light fixture that responded to shifts in conversation with changes in color that represented the current mood. 
Want to impress your date with a romantic evening? The room will automatically fill with a dreamy red and purple hue.
Is the tone in your email or speech too negative? Read it out loud to receive instant visual feedback.
Your personality, thoughts, and emotions are never static, and there's no reason your aesthetic should be either.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When on, MoodLit temporarily records 10-second audio files, which are then fed into Google Cloud Platform's Speech API that converts audio to text, and then supplies the result to the Natural Language API. The Natural Language API  analyzes the conversation for sentiment, and then updates the color of the lamp in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The base, equipped with an on and off button, and the translucent light shade for the hack were 3-D printed. An Arduino with a Bluetooth module is placed inside of the base, and RGB LED's are sautered on the bottom of the lamp.
The app was built with NativeReact. We also created an RGB library in the Arduino platform that allows the LED to smoothly transition to any color.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge for our hack was time constraint even beyond what is standard at a hackathon. Moodlit was likely the 20th idea we considered, and although we ran into a few issues when working with Google's API for the first time, our hack was mostly smooth sailing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the real-time aspect of Moodlit as well as the sleek overall design of the product.
Putting Google Home or Amazon's Alexa in your living or dining room just doesn't have the same vibe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Moodlit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Regulating the intensity of brightness, playing a variety of music, as well as analyzing tone from a speech recording would be the next steps for this project.
