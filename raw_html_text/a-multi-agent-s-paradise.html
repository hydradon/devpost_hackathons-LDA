                        Teams of equal sizes are placed in a randomly generated world. They need to stay on the path and avoiding falling into the void or being trapped by the world map getting smaller. They can push other agents and "reinforce" their team mates by standing behind them and stopping them being pushed back, or help attack an enermy player at the same time.

                        Agents are rewarded for their team performance, and intermidate rewards can be added in such as failing to respond to message of nearby friendlies.
