                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help fellow college students out with those rough all-nighters and the common deprivation of sleep. Many of us have been in that situation, where we just do not want to wake up and keep hitting snooze. All of a sudden, you are late for class because you snoozed a few too many times. Our app allows the user to depend on friends and their basic math skills to help them out in real times of need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to set an alarm in an easy-to-use time picker. When this alarm goes off, the user will be prompted with a simple math question to test how awake the user is. If they can answer it right, then the alarm will turn off just like any other. However, if they get it wrong, the alarm will snooze and the user will only have one more chance before the app sends a text message to a selected friend asking them to help wake you up. The user can set the contact friend in the tab on the upper left and that will be the designated "Woke" friend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the app in Android Studios, utilizing high priority notifications, text messaging engine, etc.

                <h2>
                    Challenges We Faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Debugging was probably the biggest issue as we found that mobile applications are not the easiest to debug. We had to learn to separate out the typical error messages that occur during startup from the messages that we actually needed to fix the problems. Even when we looked at the main error message, it was not very descriptive and generally forced us to do some very difficult troubleshooting (including logging, toast methods, etc.) to find both the real source of error and how to fix it.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments That We're Proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we set up the texting feature as we felt this was the hardest. Yet, as we went along, we found that our proudest accomplishment was the completion of the Alarm Notification system. It's ability to prompt a random yet simple math question to test if the user is awake and send the notifying text when snoozed or when the user does answers the math question incorrectly for more than 2 times.

                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal in android development, design enhancement, notification channels, an usage of various different new APIs.

                    What's Next for RUWoke
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our future plans are to create a database to help store more contacts and get existing contacts. This will make it easier to select "Woke" friends in order to help the user wake up. We would like to improve the front page interface and improve our user experience. We are also planning to add the following features to our social alarm application:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Implement Actions on Google and enable voice interactions
+Implement IoT to control lighting, curtains, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The ability to choose what kind of waking up questions you get
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Snooze length
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alarm ringtone, volume setup, vibration, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Text message format to be sent to designated "Woke" friends
