                    Honestly, the list of challenges we faced is really long to list out, so I'll just point out the main ones. To start off with, none of us showed up to Hack Rice with a team. We were all lost but then found each other. We didn't know each other, so we were unsure of how we would work together. Two of us had experience with HTML and Javascript, however we all had coding experience with Java and Python, so that was a plus. After brainstorming a solid 3 ideas, we created a mark-up of how we wanted our program to look. Once we worked out a couple of issues in regards to the mockup, we decided to call it a night and start coding the second day of the competition. Then, it was hell. We coded for 20 hours, more time than any of us have ever spent on a computer in one sitting. This was quite an experience. Even right now as I type this, I really want to sleep. Anywho, we really struggled to get things going with our project. Although 2 of us were familiar with HTML and Javascript, it had been a while since we practiced, so we were rusty. Once we thought we were getting used to it, we started realizing that the asynchrnousity of the functions in javascript was new to us, and threw us off course, causing us to spend hours debugging. Overall, I think the best lesson we learned here was to not trust external libraries that you are not familiar with. To conclude, we each started out without a team, but ended up as a family.
