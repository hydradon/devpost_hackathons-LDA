                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Around the world, people are living longer thanks to modern science and engineering. Thus, the age gap between the population is increasing. As a person ages, their sense of purpose begins to decline or stops altogether once they retire from the workforce or can no longer perform physically intense activities. Much like fresh college graduates, the aging population may think, "What now?" after accruing so much knowledge and wisdom that only comes with experience, lifelong lessons and indispensable tips are waiting to be shared with and implemented by the younger generations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does/What was the potential scope
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Geared primarily towards the aging population, Two Cents would give them the chance to share their opinion or advice on anything in life, such as analyzing a math problem to zesting a lemon to anyone curious on an interest or hobby via Q&amp;A on topics they may have special interest or passion about. The possibilities of what advice could be shared depends only on the person who can give their input. While the platform would not bar younger people from answering or connecting with others, the older population, based on age at sign-up, would be favored in answering questions proposed by anyone in that special interest they chose during sign up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To avoid questions being forever unanswered, a time limit to answer would be given before deferred to someone else to answer. When posed with a question, the person would be able to accept or decline if they wanted to answer a question in case they do not feel they have an authority on the topic at hand. After a question is answered, a window would pop up on the person who asked the question's page whether or not they would want to add the answerer as a friend to continue further discussion. A friend system would also be implemented in case people wanted to add people immediately. A chat with a random person on a certain topic would also be implemented.
