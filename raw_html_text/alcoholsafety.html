                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something that can be beneficial to the people around us, and we realized that one important problem many college students face is drinking.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project asks the individual a few questions about themselves and a beverage they've recently drank. We check our database of over 7000 alcoholic beverages legal for sale in the state of Oregon and use that data to determine the blood alcohol content of the individual close to the time immediately after consuming said beverage.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java to code the project, and the WebScraper.io chrome extension to build our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many issues with building a gui for our presentation and unfortunately were limited to the standard output in the console for java. We also attempted to port the project to Android, but also proved itself to be too ambitious for a couple of freshman considering we would need to rewrite a large portion of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Primarily, we are proud that we participated and stayed dedicated to our project despite the challenges we faced. Overall, we are happy that we were able to use webscraping to our advantage, sanitize our inputs, and use a good amount of knowledge we've learned in our classes to succeed in at least making our program usable and complete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from our new-found technical knowledge, we learned how to evenly divide a workload with a partner, develop a team-oriented mindset, and discovered the importance of brainstorming before beginning a project!
                </p>

                    What's next for AlcoholSafety
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were to continue with this project, we would continue in the pursuit of implementing a gui framework for the java program as well as learn how to port the project to Android and potentially IOS.
