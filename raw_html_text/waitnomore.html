                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are tired out waiting outside of our favorite restaurant for hours, and could not get our dishes in time when we are seated, so we want to develop this WebApp that would help customers to reverse their waitlist online and get informed of their estimated waiting time. The restaurant side of this WebApp would also help the restaurant to organize and plan their cooking and seating arrangement more efficiently.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the user side, it allows users to explore restaurants, know the waiting time of restaurants, join the current waitlist of a restaurant and make order ahead of time. All online.
For the restaurant side, it provides the restaurant with current seating arrangement and gives restaurant dynamically updating plan of future seating and cooking based on the

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the front end mainly using React, and the back end mainly using firebase. We get the information of the restaurants around the geolocation using Foursquare API, complete the payment using Stripe API and send text confirmation using Twilio API.

                <p>
                    To mark the restaurant near the geolocation that we set with dots with different colors that represent their waiting time, instead of the default Goggle Map marker.
To update both the user side and the restaurant side according the back end data changing.
