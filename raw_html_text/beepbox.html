                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mailboxes are outdated with the innovation of email and instant messaging, which often leaves important paper messages and packages unseen and susceptible to theft. We wanted to change this, with a portable, powerful, connected device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BeepBox checks if your mail has been delivered, sends you notifications of mail delivery, and if you mailbox is opened improperly. It also includes an anti-theft mechanism to keep away evil-doers. You can also use SMS to get reports of whether or not your mail has been delivered and possible threats.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built BeepBox using the MHacks Hackerboard connected to an ultrasonic sensor and a buzzer. This device is connected wirelessly to Firebase, which is monitored by a web service built on Python. This service implements the Twilio API, and acts as a central client to send notifications and receive messages by SMS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiple hardware issues and limited components kept us from expanding the board to include more features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quick communication between hardware, web services, and SMS protocol
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is possible to seamlessly connect hardware to connected services
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BeepBox
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a camera that can be remotely activated for heightened security
