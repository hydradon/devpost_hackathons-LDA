                <p>
                    <em>
                        Disaster can't be prevented, but it can be mitigated.
                    </em>
                    When disaster struck, firefighters, police force and volunteers all come together to help people and save lives. These efforts could be more coordinated and deployed faster if the people could have access to data that tells them where to go, where the most damage is, where help is needed. Our solution, Wats'on the Roof aims to do just that.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wats'on the Roof using IBM Watson classifies image feeds coming from drones flying over disaster-affected regions to help identify and deploy rescue teams where help is most needed.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Drones capture images of when flying through low altitude on pre-set paths through disaster affected zones.

                    <li>
                        Transfer and classify the data IBM Watson API for visual recognition to identify people stranded.

                    <li>
                        Through amateur radio APRS beacons, we locate volunteers and rescue teams to coordinate and effectively automating the allocation of resources at disaster-affected regions and save lives.

                        Juggling through different cloud platforms. Our team tried every way to figure out the problem case. From adding Lamda functions in AWS, to configuring Mongo DB for Azure, getting through firebase in GCP.

                    We would love to build a better classifer using the Watson IBM API, and using IBM Technologies to make the methods more efficient.
