                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not a lot of apps allow to search around your area for specific food categories, and easily see information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Locates and gives information about local restaurants of a certain type of food category. It also allows you to Snapchat the information over to a friend.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything is ran on Android.  It utilizes a REST API for restaurant data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Networking on Android is very restricted and required careful consideration.  Photos from the API were not able to be acquired via an API or web scraping.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Learning the Snapchat API and building an Android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pretty much the same as my accomplishments!

                <p>
                    I want to be able to create multiple Snapchat stickers for the various food items that are available at found restaurants.
