                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In forensic science, there is a lab pertaining to the analysis of bullets. The purpose of the lab was to determine if the bullets were shot from the same gun. This can be done by comparing bullet striations. This process is incredibly time-consuming and requires a lot of focus and concentration.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This code should take images and put it into bitmaps. From there it should compare the bitmaps and its patterns and see if there are similarities between it. If there are enough similarities it would show that the bullets do come from the same gun.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Using Python, Pillow, mumpy, arrays and bitmaps or pixelmaps.

                    Getting set-up with the correct programs and creating codes that properly work. Life.

                <p>
                    ..... Learning to use Python to some extent and also learning about coding in general.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Cygwin and setting up python to be used. Too many breaks are not good.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the data that should be acquired from the code, we can use it to analyze the similarities between them. If there are enough similarities between the patterns presented, then it can confidently be inferred that the bullets come from the same gun. This can be used in Criminal Identification and allows for the correct perpetrator to be brought to justice.
