                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can upload a picture of their pet and ideally their friend's pet. Then users can vote on which pet they think is cuter and view the results.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, Firebase, and Java.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges, many involving sending data to and receiving data from the cloud. This was the first time using Android studio or Java for all of us and so it was a learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of connecting our backend database located on Firebase to our front-end. There were many times that we felt like giving up so making the app itself work was a big accomplishment, as simple as it is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a simple Android application, connect it to the internet, and how to code in Java to some degree.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the UI not ugly, adding user authentication so one person doesn't have to upload both pictures, fixing many bugs
