                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never done javascript before, Dan wanted to do a trumpet so I was like, "Hey! I don't know anything about band but I've played piano for twelve years!" And thus a beautiful Frankenstein piano was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It plays keys! Also has a "recording" function whereupon you can play a sequence of notes and have them played back to you. Only one key at a time, though, it might fall apart if you try more at once.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of tinkering with javascript. The audio files were taken off of freesound. Also, I've only been running it in Chrome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript has some seriously weird timing issues that were a pain to sort out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Workaround for abovementioned weird timing issue, also getting the recording function to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A bit of JS/jQuery, also how Intellij works.

                    <li>
