                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were trying to code something in C, so we were looking online for tutorials and guides for specific programs. We came across cprogramming.com and realized how old and how terrible the website is. So we decided it'd be fun to learn html instead and create a template website that would replace cprogramming.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a template html website for the home page of cprogramming.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to use a lot of html and css tutorials and lots of sweat and brute force. Both of use have never used HTML or CSS before so it was a fun challenge to do something new that could be functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Easily the major challenge was working with three languages where 2/2 of us had no previous knowledge with HTML. Any basic functions, syntax, and methods required research. Figuring out how to do everything from run the website to make sure it was able to be seen on mobile was a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of making a template of a website that looks awesome, if I say so myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about flex boxes and the general design of a website, which we didn't realize is much harder than we expected.

                <p>
                    Wonderful sleep and a beautiful shower. Maybe a foot mask if I say so myself.
