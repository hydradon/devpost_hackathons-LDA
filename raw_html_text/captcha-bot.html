                    I have taken hundred's of Confident CAPTCHAs and I find them to be very annoying. I wondered if they were actually effective or just a waste of time.

                    If you give this bot an image, it can tell you whether or not it is a store front.

                    I had to dfind hundreds of images of storefronts and hundreds of images of Google street view images which don't have store fronts to train the computer.

                <h2>
                    The average precision is .998, which means that this AI is now more accurate than a human at solving these CAPTCHAs
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Computers can be trained to solve Confident CAPTCHAs faster and more accurately than humans. Therefore, we should use other forms of CAPTCHAs instead of subjecting humans to meaningless Confident CAPTCHAs.
