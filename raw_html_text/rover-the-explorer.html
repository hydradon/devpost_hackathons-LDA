                    Hacked 2019 project. We are implementing a VR controller Rover. The user wears a VR headset that places them in a first-person perspective from the rover. They can control the rover by using the joystick and sending those commands to the android phone mounted on the rover through the LAN network. Those commands, are then relayed to the arduino based motor controller. The android phone is constantly streaming visual information from the camera to the desktop computer which processes these and plot them in a 3D virtual space, allowing the user to interact with the environment.

                    In hazardous and potentially deadly environments, machine reconnaissance is usually the optimal method for exploration. Locations like unexplored mines, post-catastrophe rubble, nuclear wastelands and even interplanetary exploration pose too much risk for humans. As a solution, machines are sent as the explorers that will relay valuable information without putting anyone at risk.
