                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the ways that both music and weather can influence mood. We wanted to create an application that was a basic model of how that relationship can be effected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It finds the user's location, gets the weather in that location, and then plays a certain artist's music based on the weather.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used two APIs, one to get the weather, wunderland, and then the soundcloud API to get the weather and music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A couple of little problems involving figuring out bootstrap, we also ran into a lot of problems deploying the webpage using git APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon and we had to learn a lot about how to use APIs and host websites that none of us knew how to do previously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use azure to host websites and also how to use APIs and better how to use CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Climatracks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to create a user authentication system to allow for personalization of the music played during different times and with different weather.
