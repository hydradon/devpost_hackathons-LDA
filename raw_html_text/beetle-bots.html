                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always been interested in the things Unity had to offer, through the course of the hackathon I went through three different ideas. This is the lasting one. Also I do not like beetles and cockroaches. So, naturally, they are the enemy in this game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game. You try and get a higher score than your friend, so you can hound at him at how inaccurate he is with a mouse, and how he easily becomes tilt the closer he comes to your score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How to Play
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Click the the Beetle Bot logo to enter the game
Then hold your left click mouse button down to start the game officially. Beetles will begin to spawn and chase your mouse cursor. If they collide with your mouse cursor, or you collide with the blue walls on the side, you lose. 
Top score is the current game score and the bottom is your high score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity 5.5.1, with the language of choice being C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After having problems syncing player to client commands, I decided to go a different route with this game.
There also is a lot of Unity specific lingo/syntax that is unique to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Glad that I came, this being me first. Also, finally finishing/submitting a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot more about Unity server/client side relationships, and how functions contructed to reduce as much latency as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Beetle Bots
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe multiplayer? I really wished that this event was 36 hours, because I feel that I could possibly get it implemented in that extra time.
