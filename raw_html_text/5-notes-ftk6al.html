                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was listening to the radio in the car, and suddenly it hit me. I remember the time when I used to create music through a software called GarageBand. It was really fun and I though it'd be even more fun to do something similar, but through Alexa. And that's when I began to make my skill, 5 notes, an interactive, educational game to introduce and familiarizes kids with musical notes from various instruments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of this game is to beat all 50 levels. Each time you beat all levels, you will earn a new title. In the game, you will hear 5 sounds from different instruments and you have to guess the note being played. To play, you say 5 notes with phrases like, low a, mid c, or high g.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I programmed the skill using AWS lambda, Dynamo DB, and S3. I used the Alexa skills kit in lambda to program the whole skill. I used dynamo DB to save certain information in the table after exiting the skill. And I used S3 to upload all my musical sound clips that were used in the skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a butt load of challenges. I spent numerous days programming this because of the complex algorithms and I the limited code options and SSML audio files allows by Amazon. Because of these I had to make changes to what my skill was going to be and how it would function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I learned a lot from this whole experience. I started from knowing nothing about Alexa programming and little bit of javascript, to programming this complex skill. It makes me feel happy to know that I gained something from this challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to program in javascript, specifically the Alexa programming. I learned how to utilize Dynamo DB and S3. I learned how to make a good skill that was fun and educational.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 5 Notes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will add more instruments to make the challenge more difficult. I also need to fix some bugs, if any. If Amazon allows more audio clips in the SSML, I can make the game harder by having players guess even more notes from even more audio clips. With this addition, I can also let users compose their own  music. And if Amazon allows multiple audio files to played at the same time, users can create complex composures.
