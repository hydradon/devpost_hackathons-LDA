                    open-choreo
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Teaches you how to dance like Bruno Mars and other famous dancers!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Open-choreo uses openpose to see how well you match your favorite choreography videos. It compares your pose against those in dance videos and ensures that you've mastered your move.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Open-chorea uses advanced computer vision and machine learning modules such as OpenCV, Tensorflow, and websockets! But don't worry about that... just dance ♪┏(・o･)┛♪┗ ( ･o･) ┓♪

                <h3>
                    Server
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This calculates poses using a state-of-the-art-server with a high-end GPU called "turtle" - thanks
                    <code>
                        alamp
                    </code>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    To run this server, type:
                    <code>
                        python posenet-python server.py
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This server takes in base64 encoded images, calculates pose information using posenet, and returns the coordinates of your nose, mouth, and other bodily organs in medium-dimensional matrices.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Webcam
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The client of the server is the webcam. The webcam takes each frame, converts it to a base64 string, and sends it to the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then it processes the returned string and does a complex smoothing algorithm* that we invented ourselves (!!!). This ensures that the feedback you're seeing are TOP NOTCH.
                </p>
                <p>
                    *the smoothing algorithm takes historical frames and figures out the best result for the move.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Scoring
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We also invented this algorithm, yipee!!! But yeah, it just tells you how good you are lol - calculates the error between your pose and the dance video's pose.
