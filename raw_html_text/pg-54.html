    It charts and graphs the information received on a local computer and on the cloud. This allows outsides users, such
 as loved ones to access the information and compare it to normal, habitual data and gives them an accurate guess
 about the well-being of the PG-54 user.

    were interfaced with appropriate sensors to give information on their usage. Abnormally low usage is a red flag.
