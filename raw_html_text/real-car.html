                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make this design by games like Pokemon Go and combining it with the racing genre like Burnout Paradise and Forza.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app imports a map onto the drivable pane and adds a car that can drive on this panel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Unity and C# to program a car that can drive on a plane. Using Google Maps API and ArcGIS libraries, we were able to add a map to a drivable pane and import points from map data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues getting the map to present itself onto the background cube to drive on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud when we got the code to import the image onto the background.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to use Unity and C#. We had very little to no knowledge on how to use them and now we are familiar with how to use these applications to make a basic game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Real Car
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our plan is to develop an algorithm to map the roads in the area and make it so that the car can drive on it. Also, we wanted to add a guiding arrow to show how to get from the start point and end point. Moreover, we would add music and a menu.
