                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The development for Sagashi was inspired by the emerging Microsoft Hololens devices and our awareness of the limitations of the human mind and capabilities. By creating Sagashi, we wished to make what humans were poor at, a lot better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sagashi takes in images, time, and voice from the Hololens. This data is then sent to a database, where a web application on the computer end can search the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Hololens side of the application was programmed using Unity. We set up the database as a MySQL database, and the web application was built in HTML/CSS/PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of two people, we were limited both by experience and manpower for the project's development. Another monumental challenge we encountered was the installation of services for the Unity and the Hololens; many of the programs we installed (e.g. OpenCV for Visual Studio) required our investigation of Windows itself. Finally, a challenge we ran into was difficulties in sending queries to the MySQL database.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of completing our web application and interface that solved a common problem that we faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned new things about Unity, web applications, and databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sagashi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to incorporate more fluid usage of the program and apply this technology to other headsets as well.
