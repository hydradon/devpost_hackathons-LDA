                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The point of this project is to have this program run while I play chess games and get hints that I could compare with my moves so I can learn more about the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program is an AI chess bot that does speech recognition so I can talk to it while playing chess games and keep it updated on the state of the game. It would advise me which next move would be best.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two libraries were used: Chess.js and Chessboard.js
We added the intelligence of the robot to decide which next move would be best using simple minimax with alpha beta pruning. We also added nuance's speech recognition so we can keep it updated on the state of the game.

                <p>
                    Learning how to use the chess library and the nuance speech recognition API.
