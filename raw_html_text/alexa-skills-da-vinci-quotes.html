                    At AWS Summit 18-19 April 2017 there was a workshop for building Alexa Skills, which was the first hands-on Alexa workshop I'd been to so I decided to give it a go.

                    Alexa Skill that shares the words of wisdom of Leonardo da Vinci, the greatest genius the world has known. The skill is provided in English and in German.

                        How I built it

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built with Amazon Alexa, Amazon Lambda, Amazon Cloudwatch to track and troubleshoot log files, Node.JS (the Alexa sdk) and tested with Echosim.io.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    <strong>
                        Challenges I ran into
                    </strong>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was coded for English-US, English-GB and German languages which are what Alexa currently supports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my code, I'd used
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        const languageStrings = {
    'en-UK': {translation: {
    FACTS: [
    'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.',
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    and this generated an error message. It turned out that I needed to use 'en-GB'!!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the German part of the skill I had to make some judgement calls because Google Translate had three options for da Vinci's most famous quote, "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

                </p>
                <p>
                    I opted for "Einfachheit ist die ultimative Raffinesse."

                    Originally, I'd also translated the quotes into Italian and both forms of Chinese (pinyin and pictograph) before discovering that Alexa doesn't currently support these languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any case, I have the Italian and Chinese language codes ready and good to go when Alexa does support them.

                    Most Alexa apps seem to have been coded by male engineers and I'm happy I was there in the AWS Summit workshop to represent female engineers and to learn the technical skills I needed. Male:female ratio in the workshop seemed to be 120:3.

                    Learning how all the moving parts of building an Alexa Skill works is really useful knowledge. It helped me to put Slots into context and to understand the Intent Logic of Alexa.

                    I'm planning to do a Chocolate Recommendations app whereby Alexa then enables the buyer to
                    <strong>
                        order chocolate from Amazon by voice
                    </strong>
                    . So if I win a prize in this hackathon that would tool me more to do that since I don't own any Alexa devices!

                    More broadly, I'm hoping to integrate Alexa, Polly, Lex and other technologies so we can leave
