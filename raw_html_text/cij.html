                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up for this app idea because sometimes you are feeling down, and need a nice compliment or funny joke.  Other times, you want a funny insult. This app is perfect for those instances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, input your name. Then choose the crying-laughing emoji if you want a random joke, the blushing emoji if you want a compliment, or the mad emoji if you want an insult. Then, you can hit the redo button for another, or go back if you want to change options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CIJ was built using swift on xcode. We used framework UIKit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenge was transferring data between view controllers.
