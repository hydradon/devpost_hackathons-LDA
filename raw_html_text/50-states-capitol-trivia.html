                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> I was inspired to start programming an Alexa skill because I wanted to see my own skill being published and looked at by all people. My Alexa skill, 50 States Capitol Trivia, tests peoples knowledge on the fifty states and their capitols. The game starts when Alexa explains the rules of the game. The game includes 5 questions and has multiple choices. I built this trivia using aws and it's Lambda function, in addition to the Alexa skills kit. One of the challenges I ran into was that the tester wouldn't be able to open my skill. At the end, I figured out that my invocation name wasn't set to the right one. I'm really proud of this program because it was my first Alexa skill I have ever made and I had spent so much time working on it. I really like this program because I was able to find funny names to put in the trivia. After finishing this Alexa skill, I learned that programming wasn't too hard and that it was actually fun thinking of ideas, programming, and testing. My next goal for 50 States Capitol Trivia is to add more answer options, or change the way Alexa talks.
