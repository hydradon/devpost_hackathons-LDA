                    We created a website that allows users to gain information about their health.
It has a navigation bar that lets you navigate efficiently, and is full of information about different
diets and exercises.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used github to communicate between team members. The project
was coded on Visual Studio Code and viewed through web pages online.
We used w3Schools for our open-source software.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    In the beginning our javascript/css/html skills were not very strong. We needed
frequent help from upper class students and professors.
