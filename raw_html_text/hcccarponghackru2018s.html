                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration are Elon Musk and Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg. Just like them, I know I will be making something great and positive in this world. I am planning to own Apple by learning its language first, and create many apps that will help mankind. I made this app in order to be helpful using ARKit and giving the best user experience with the power of Augmented Reality

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An Augmented Reality Pong Game that its goal is to give a one of a kind experience to its user by going against a computer and not allowing the ball pass the the user's paddle by having to run side to side horizontally. This ball's speed will be faster as time goes by.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built with ARKit. A new library by one of the newest language out there, which is Swift. It consist of a stage, 2 paddles, a ball, and walls

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the challenge that we ran into is setting up the environment and making sure there is some kind of randomness on the ball's movement which will make it challenging for the user just as much as for the computer, kind of

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we got a couple of nodes in our app works the way we intended it to be. We also love how we are able to tackle something unknown to not just most people but unknown to many programmers out there made us feel proud about ourselves.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are amazing artworks my teammate created which I couldnt implement because of my lack of understanding and/or unsupported format was a huge lesson we learned.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will definitely continue working on Augmented Reality as we see a potential with this library. We want to make the most helpful and creative AR Apps that the world has yet to see.
