                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the hardware available and the opportunity to use microcontrollers and LED's, such as Spark Core.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The O watch stylishly keeps track of time using three different LED colors, with a blue second hand, a green minute hand, and a white hour hand. The watch is attached to the user's wrist for ease and comfort of use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a 5V power supply to power the Spark Core. We then coded the LED's using C++. This involved importing the neopixel library, and syncing the watch to real-time as well as creating a delay between groups of LED's, with each group representing a different number on a traditional watch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were challenged by importing particle libraries and figuring out how to control hardware using microcontrollers, such as in our original idea, which involved a Grove 3-axis accelerometer. Because we were less familiar with the exact specifications of Spark Core, using this hardware was a challenge as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were successfully able to use Spark Core to communicate between our software and hardware. We're also proud that we were able to successfully overcome significant errors and work as a team to debug code and work to everyone's skill sets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to coordinate and build a project as a team, as well as important coding skills, such as coordinating hardware and software using a microcontroller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for O Watch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will be able to calculate how correct your posture is at any given time using an accelerometer.
