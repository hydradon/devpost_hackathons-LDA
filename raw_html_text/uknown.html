                    Parking meter printers can generate between 2,500 and 5,000 different tickets in a single refill, moving the meter payment system to the cloud reduces the total number of paper wasted. Searching for Parking Costs Americans

                <h2>
                    How it works?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the user registers to the application the app adds the user as an
                    <i>
                        <b>
                            Entity
                        </b>
                    </i>
                    to the Stack blockchain when the user successfully registers the app will connect the
                    <b>
                        user_id
                    </b>
                    with their
                    <b>
                        license_plate
                    </b>
                    , and will automatically create a
                    <b>
                        personal QR code
                    </b>
                    . Since this is a decentralized ecosystem the data can only be accessed via the
                    <i>
                        <b>
                            Explorer
                        </b>
                    </i>
                    , therefore, police officers will find the records of users via the QR code (a sticker on the windshield, just like EZ-pass) without necessarily having control over the dataset of all users. The record from this entity will simply have the location (google map api), time-stamp, and if the user has paid the parking meter. To avoid getting tickets, the app will send a push notification to the user X minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the user parks, the user will have the option to say that the car is parked at X location (obtained via app), and when the user leaves, the app will ask if the user has left. If the user confirms, the app will pinpoint in the map that location where the user parked the car and will allow nearby drivers to see the newly available parking space.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Problem: React native (expo) did not support Blockstack, unable to use Blockstack because of backend problems.
Solution: Drastically change programming languages, and create a new approach to solve the same problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Problem: Unable to check if the user paid parking meter through license plate number because blockchain does not allow you to add a license plate number, is only accessible by USER_ID.
Solution: Connect user_id to QR_code, and registering user with car plate number.
