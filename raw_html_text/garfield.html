                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a bunch of lazy people and decided to make our lives at home even lazier. What's better than controlling your household appliances from the reaches of your fingers?
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's right folks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to control household applications from your Telegram app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To control the appliances, you must first add the Bot in Telegram. 
The Raspberry Pi serves as a hub, with a speaker, LED lights and a camera attached to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the things you can do to the appliances:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Control the brightness of the lights. We have special modes for the lights, such as Disco lights, Breathing patterns etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Play music
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take pictures with the camera. There's also a special mode to detect intruders
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Broadcast messages over the speakers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A few settings for the lights and sounds, such as Romantic, Productive etc
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    If you want to have a better idea of what our project does, I guess you could come down to our booth.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python server running on a Raspberry Pi. It acts as our Telegram Bot server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made use of a number of Python libraries such as wolframalpha, picamera, PIL, telepot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to have speech recognition, but we couldn't get it to work on the Pi (trust us, we spent the whole night trying :( if you do know how, please feel free to tell us). Which was quite tragic so we defaulted all our commands to text over the Telegram Bot.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making this thing work is in itself a great accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python libraries are very powerful. Hardware is not as easy to hack on as we thought (we're a bunch of CS students who dabble mainly in software...)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Find a way for speech recognition, or die trying (just joking).
