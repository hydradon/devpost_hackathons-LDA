                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to make a game that involved a character that could shoot projectiles that expand into platforms after making contact with the surface of a falling object. The platforms would then bounce back at the player and act as the platforms that the player would jump on to make it to the other side of the map and win. This was our goal because it introduces a new element of challenge in the area of 2D platforming games. The game that influenced this idea was Portal because it became well-known due to its original idea of turning the projectiles into portals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't Touch the Lava is a 2D platformer game where the player is a block that can jump and move left and right. The player's goal is to make it to the trophy in the fewest attempts. The game involves three extremely difficult (but doable) levels that the player has to pass to win the game. There is a counter in the upper left-hand corner that keeps track of how many attempts the player has had at beating the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed it from scratch in java through following numerous guides and learning from those guides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how difficult it is to program a game from start to finish without using game-making software. The largest difficulty was having too large of a scope for our initial project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of spending so much time learning about a field that all of us had very little experience in. We are proud of this because it is far easier falling back on skills that you already have than gaining new ones (especially with a time constraint).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how complex game development can get and how games are structured in java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Don't Touch the Lava
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The features that we would add next are a scoreboard to keep track of which player completes the three levels the fastest, and which player completes the three levels in the fewest attempts.
