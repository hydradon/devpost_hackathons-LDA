                <p>
                    Increasingly, kids and teachers are using Youtube videos as educational tools. But when you're watching a video, there's usually no way to tell the sources that were used to generate the content. Sure, some creators have a list of sources linked in the description, but it's just a disorganized list with no way of knowing which source goes with which part of the video. That's where VCite comes in.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VCite takes a link to a youtube video and a list of sources used - just a simple list of URLs, no organization needed - and spits out a fully cited transcript that.
