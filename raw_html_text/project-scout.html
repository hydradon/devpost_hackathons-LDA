                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to Statistics Canada, 1 in 5 Canadians have disabilities, with mobility disabilities being the most prevalent. It is difficult for people to navigate the city, which is filled with construction, ill-maintained roads, and other obstacles. We envision a world where people can explore without limitation, and are making it our mission to design a novel application to help people navigate around these obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are designing an innovative application to help users with disabilities plan and navigate around potential obstacles that would impede travel. Users will be able to access an extensive list of locations, and assign ratings as to the current accessibility of the location. These ratings can be used to assist in travel, providing a reliable, comfortable, and safe route for handicapped individuals. User-submitted descriptions provide a more detailed insight into potential accessibility problems the user may encounter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To create a simple, easy to use interface, we used Figma to design the front end of our project. Despite the twelve hour time limit, our team quickly picked up Figma, as it's easy to use. With Figma, we could collaborate as a team in a real-time environment to create an interface that is responsive, visually appealing, and easy to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The back end structure of Project Scout utilized a server, built using Node.js and Express.js. These two powerful packages can accept requests and information from our front end. Once fetched, they can modify and return those results based on the internal representation of our mapping system. With such a simple yet elegant design, we crafted a functional proof of concept of our idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project Scout was an exciting, yet difficult challenge for our team. We used JavaScript to combine our front and back ends, which required the back end subgroup to learn JavaScript in a short time period. Excellent communication between the front end and back end subgroups was vital to the success of this project, and was difficult for the first few hours of the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After hours of research, collaboration, and advice from mentors, we managed to transition from design to a working prototype of our project. It wasn't easy, but it was a tremendously fun challenge that I'm sure our team will remember for years to come.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is proud of the many things we learned and accomplished at Build Day 2019. We're proud that we learned how to use the Google Map API, html, JavaScript, and Figma. With what we learned, we were able to collaborate as a group to bridge our design with our code to form a product that can help millions in Canada navigate and explore freely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Google Map API, html, JavaScript, and Figma. We also learned how to work effectively as a team, how to share our ideas, and when to ask for help from experienced mentors. Overall, Build Day has been a tremendous learning opportunity, and our team is excited to participate in future hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Scout
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project Scout has the potential to create tremendous impact in the day to day lives of millions of Canadians. Using the Google Maps API, we will utilize the cloud and advanced algorithms to present the optimal route to users in a clear, informative view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Project Scout team will also reach out to the community and engage with stakeholders to craft a product designed for the users, and with the help of the users. We think that by taking this extra step, we can make something truly special.
