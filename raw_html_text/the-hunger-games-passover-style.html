                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration, of course, is the Pesach story itself. With its gripping nature and central nature on this night, we figured that it ought to be taught by more contemporary methods of education: Like Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a module for Alexa, that can test the user on the details of the ten plagues, with a degree of humor added to endear it to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Alexa demo, coding in node.js, as well as MySQL and node.js/express.js to access that information (not finished, and thus can't be demoed).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The database hosting gave a number of problems, and didn't allow us to easily direct the users to a landing page. There was also some complications with Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got Alexa to speak! But more, we got her to save state and continue on for a fair few questions; and more, we are proud about hopefully inspiring the next generation to remember and continue to speak of the Passover story.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Alexa is fun to use, but at times, can be loud. And frustrating.
                </p>

                    What's next for The Hunger Games: Passover Style
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Can someone say "The Hunger Games: Sinai"?
