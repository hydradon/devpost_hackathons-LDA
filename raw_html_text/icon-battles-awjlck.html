                    Inspiration- we got our inspiration from Zach's 5 icon scissors paper rock game in which he made.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- icon battles is a game where each player chooses his or her icon and fights the other player.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it- we had 3 people in our group but Amanda helping us, so what we did was... Joseph designing the pictures, Zach wrote the JavaScript and i did the photos and CSS.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into- we had a few problems with our bugs but we fixed them with the help of Amanda.
