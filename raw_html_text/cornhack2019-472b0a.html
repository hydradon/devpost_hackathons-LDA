                        As a victim of bullying, I wish someone was there to stop it. The current problem with safety is that with a large student body on campus, it's impossible to help every individual who is in danger.

                    How we built it

                    <li>
                        We started tackling the problem by looking at our University of Nebraska students community.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Models were trained on a UCF Fighting dataset. We acquired images data of roughly 3000 violence images, which was then filtered into violence and non-violence.  We use Tensorflow as the backend to handle video frame predicting. The model is stacked with 4 interlacing layers of convolutional, Batchnorm and dropout. A front end framework using JS and HTML to deploy our deep learning application. We simulate live video feeds from security cameras by having a pre-labeled video by our model embedded into difference region of the map.

                    <li>
                        Our projects integrate with a camera system process video feeds frames by frame and predict if a violence scene happen. When a violence scene happens a notification is sent.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        However, using deep learning technology, we built a system that can detect violence as soon as it happens. This could integrate with surveillance security cameras to identify at-risk situations quickly and can be used to notify important persons to help

                    <li>
                        We had an issue training our deep-learning model. With our limitation of hardware, The validation process of hyperparameter tuning and training process consumes a large amount of times. Lacks of images data cause our model to fluctuate with an accuracy of 70% on trainset.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many of us do not have any background in javascript and front end design. The integration between the backend process and front-end is our biggest pull-back.
