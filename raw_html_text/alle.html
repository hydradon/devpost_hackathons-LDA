                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With previous experiences using Alexa dot at home, we were inspired to create a Google Chrome extension that can interact with Amazon Alexa using speech recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        speech recognition friendly
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        allows youtube to open up within the Google Chrome extension
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        multiple commands within Amazon Alexa for users to interact with.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Alle, a combination of Amazon and Google, using programming languages such as Javascript, Html, CSS, Photoshop CC, and multiple Alexa skill sets to customize the different interactions that use speech recognition for Amazon Alexa.
