                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most current plant trackers are expensive and hard to use.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracks your plants soil moisture content to tell you how well it is doing. Also tells you how the plants around it are doing so you can compete with your friends!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meteor stack for the web-app and an esp8266 arduino that tracks the soil moisture and sends it over websockets to the Meteor server.
