                    Who We Are?
Wi-Move Inc. is a collective of tech nerds, managers, marketers, and creators consistently innovating the way people use technology to connect with others through networks and interpersonal experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What We Do? 
Wi-Move Inc. created a wearable sensor (Wi-Move sensor) that extends the reach of existing Wi-Fi networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why We Do It?
Currently in Brooklyn, the Wi-Fi network provides free Wi-Fi in areas bordered by Schermerhorn Street, Cadman Plaza West, Flatbush Avenue, and Tillary Street, along with limited spaces in NYCHA Ingersoll and Whitman Houses. 
This usage congestion causes the Wi-Fi connection to be weak and slow. Also, Brooklynites who don&rsquo;t reside in these specified areas are unable to connect on to the Downtown Brooklyn Wi-Fi network. As a result, Brooklyn residents must use their mobile data to obtain Wi-Fi or pay for it.
The Wi-Move sensor will allow all Brooklynites to use free Wi-Fi. In addition, the sensor eliminates congestion on Wi-Fi networks so that the connection is stronger, faster and more accessible. 
With the Wi-Move sensor, Wi-Fi becomes powered by the people&hellip;literally. Walk, jog, skate, or even ride your bike&hellip;whatever you do, just move around Brooklyn! 
How It Works?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using Wi-Move mobile sensors, people can broaden the reach of existing Wi-Fi networks to provide their fellow Brooklynites with Wi-Fi connectivity. The Wi-move sensor repeats existing free Wi-Fi signals which helps expand the accessibility of free Wi-Fi networks while also reducing Wi-Fi network congestion. 
The sensor will connect individuals to the nearest free Wi-Fi network. As an individual keeps moving, the sensor will continuously connect that individual to the closet free Wi-Fi network. In this way, it tracks movement as individuals leave one free Wi-Fi network, and use another. 
No more worrying about lost Wi-Fi connectivity or slow Wi-Fi connection!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why Does It Benefit You?
&bull; Community interaction 
&bull; Promotions and discounts at local businesses through the Wi-Move platform
&bull; Increase in foot traffic for local businesses
&bull; Exercise
&bull; Less road congestion
&bull; Making a more sustainable Brooklyn
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Wi-Move sensor promotes community interaction by allowing people to help others maintain free and reliable Wi-Fi connection. Brooklynites can work together!
Individuals also get rewarded for being on the move! As individuals move through Brooklyn, they pass through Wi-Move checkpoints that unleash promotional offerings and discounts on items at local businesses within the area. As a result, businesses can increase consumer traffic as well.
Not only does Wi-Move encourage exercise, (walking, bicycling, roller-skating, etc.) it can reduce carbon foot print that cars and buses exude and alleviate road congestion!
The most amazing part? We&rsquo;re keeping Brooklyn alive! As the borough becomes the hotspot for more residents, tourists, and businesses, there&rsquo;s a need to keep people connected in Brooklyn! Wi-Move sensors make this possible!
