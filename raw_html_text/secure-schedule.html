                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's lots of scheduling apps out, but none offer the security that comes with the blockchain.  We wanted to be the first to throw our chips on the table with our project Safer Schedule.  Collaborative scheduling is a headache, and a schedule change by one collaborator can lead to disastrous miscommunication.  With the blockchain, you can keep track of any schedule changes with the added benefit of end-to-end encryption.
                    <strong>
                        Serverless, distributed, secure.
                    </strong>
                    <em>
                        Normal schedules are bland, Safer Schedule is Spicy.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A safer, more secure schedule for collaborating with others, or just keeping track of your day to day.  Safer schedule allows you and your friends to create and share calendar events.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our scheduling tool using React, and harmoniously married it with Blockstack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning React isn't easy, and getting our first ever React program to work with Blockstack (also our first experience) yielded a lot of head scratching.  However we are pleased to say that we have emerged from the other side relatively unscathed, and holding our own Excalibur.

                    React &amp; Blockstack.  A greater appreciation for the blockchain, and back-end programmers.
