                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In California, especially in the Bay Area, classrooms are often over filled, making it harder for teachers to pay attention to each students specific needs. This results in advanced students not learning and students who need help being left behind.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Algorithmetic is a machine learning based math practice website for students and teachers. Algorithmetic uses specialized algorithms to generate new and unique math problems that are tailored for each student based off of their weaknesses. Algorithmetic also gives advanced student performance statistics to teachers so they can improve their in class teaching experience.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the algorithm for generating problems tailored to the user's skill level using python, and used Hasura as a database to send information to the website. The website was made with html/css, javascript, and php.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into were using Hasura, which none of us were knowledgeable in, which proved challenging to make the code for. Also, it was challenging to develop the algorithm to generate math problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is proud of developing a working algorithm that generates math problems, and working with Hasura, which was difficult to work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that new technologies have many surprises that you don't expect, and we should dedicate more time to make sure that we understand it in full.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Algorithmetic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to add more concepts to the algorithm, including algebraic problems, and more complex problems.
