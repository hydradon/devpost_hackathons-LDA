                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over 1 million Americans get their prescription medication delivered using mail-order pharmacy services provided by Pharmacy Benefit Managers, such as OptumRx. That number is only expected to increase as more and more people gain internet access. Medications today are incredibly effective against a wide variety of diseases, however speed is vital. There are countless cases of patients across the country who are not able to start their medication regimens on time due to incorrect address information that is shared with the pharmacy processing the prescription. It can then take the pharmacy days to sort through and get the correct information, which can lead to reduced efficacy of the medication. Our team wanted to develop this tool to help standardize addresses provided to pharmacies, to ensure that patients get their medications on time, and have a better chance of fighting against all diseases.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a spreadsheet of addresses that are in an unstandardized format and standardizes each entry. Addresses that cannot be confidentially standardized are returned with an error message so that they can be manually checked for accuracy (sometimes additional information is required). All addresses are then validated through the USPS API.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The python library that we used (usaddress) does not always accurately tag each address component, so we had to write code to handle those cases by hand.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our code can handle a plethora of tough-to-standardize cases.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Standardizing addresses is harder than it sounds!
