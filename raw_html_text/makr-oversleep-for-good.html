                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let&rsquo;s face it, waking up is tough in the morning can be tough sometimes. This is why we have taken a spin on the classic alarm clock. We&rsquo;re proud to introduce Wakr, the alarm clock for the social good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wakr is an alarm clock that aims to help you wake up in the morning in a different way. First, you place a coin before going to sleep on it, go to sleep and wait for the next morning. If you don&rsquo;t wake up when the alarm sounds, an arm will reach to your money and keep it away from you until you complete a 21-day challenge without oversleeping. On the other hand, if you don&rsquo;t leave money on the tray, a fixed amount will be donated to your preferred NGO. 
Wakr has a built-in &ldquo;shame mode&rdquo; that donates the money you&rsquo;ve accumulated to your NGO if you open the case before reaching your goal.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build Wakr we haveused everything we had, hammers and saws, stepper engines, JavaScript + JQuery, Go Language and Python for the programming, Photoshop and Illustrator to design the UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several challenges while developing and deploying the project. First of all, hardware, hardware, hardware. Getting your hands dirty implies tackling different obstacles, from engines that don&rsquo;t turn to running around the city to fetch last-hour materials. We also faced design challenges while developing Wakr that had been solved on the go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, we are proud of submitting the project on time, developing a piece of hardware always adds a layer of complexity to the problem. Managing to setup everything has been a challenge. We are also proud of being able to work together under pressure without having any internal problems.
