                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My goal is to map all software development to a single platform. ONE, ONE+, and Trinity were the first steps in that mission, but now the platform requires a Turing complete language that can compete with Java and C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Force can replace and seamlessly integrate with any general purpose turing complete language by using a Trinity powered transpiler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, only documentation exists for Force. However, the syntax of Force is defined by ONE and ONE+, and the compiler will be implemented in Trinity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The specification is still incomplete and development on the compiler has yet to start.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Force
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Force may be the only language I use once it's complete.
