                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game where most of the map would be hidden from the player. We also wanted to have a player vs. player element in our game to create some intense moments. We found that a maze would work perfectly since being able to only see the walls directly around you creates a claustrophobic feeling and fear what might be around the corner. We also wanted to implement a game mechanic from a popular game mode called Gun Game. If you were able to exit the maze, you would advance to the next maze. First player to complete the last maze wins. However, if your character is destroyed, you will be demoted back down to the previous maze.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a web based game that is meant to be played by multiple players on different computers. The object of the game is to be the first player to complete all the mazes. When the game starts the player can only see what is directly around him. While trying to solve the maze the player can pick up pieces of light to increase their vision range. When the player completes the maze, they will progress to the next maze and their light will be reset. However, if another player kills them they will be demoted back to the previous maze.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using p5.js library.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we were trying to build the program in Phaser.io, but we found that it wasn't working well for creating the game we wanted. Our biggest challenge was creating a maze with collision detection.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of getting the the random maze generator to work with our maze box objects. We are also proud of checking for collision detection that doesn't require scanning every box object. Instead it only detects and checks the 8 boxes that surround the player. We are also proud of creating the mask that surrounds the player since its a pretty neat trick.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to randomly generate a maze. It is a very interesting algorithm. We also learned how to move a player around a maze without having to scan every single box.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for It's a-MAZE-ing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really want to bring our game onto a server and add player vs player elements. We also want to implement level progression as well as "special" light pickups. We also want to balance the players with more light with players with less light. Players with less light would have a shorter delay on a dodge mechanic since higher light level players will have the advantage of sight.
