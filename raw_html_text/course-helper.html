                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to have an easier time finding what courses I should sign up for so that I could complete all of my requirements.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It ranks classes that fulfill requirements based on how many other requirements it also fulfills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We parsed several text files off of Rutger's websites which we compiled into a database which eventually lead to a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The text files on rutgers were not very consistent and there were constant issues with our cloud9.io development environment.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finished this project despite spending 5 hours on one weird bug.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask is a very finicky framework - especially on cloud 9.
