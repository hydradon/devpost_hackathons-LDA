                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whether you're at your home town or in a new city, there's always somewhere to discover. Whether you're seeking an adventure or looking to relax at a new coffee shop, we want to make a convenient and curated solution by allowing you to connect to your community and share experiences. A social media app built around sharing experiences can allow you to immerse yourself into wherever you are.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can create or view "Stories". These are crafted itineraries that are shared for people to experience. Users can favorite or comment them to share their opinions and start conversations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built in React Native with Firebase for our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of time deciding on what technologies to use. We initially went with Java in Android Studio but ran into problems integrating Firebase. We then settled with React Native as it would be a faster solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never created an Android app before so being able to switch to React Native and complete the app despite spending a lot of time in Java is something we're proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a better foundation on building Android apps and learned a lot on front end development. Some technologies we learned: React Native, Android Studio, Firebase, node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Explore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to create a full experience app with many more features (such as sharing to Facebook, geo tagging, etc.) and a better user experience in Java with Android Studio.
