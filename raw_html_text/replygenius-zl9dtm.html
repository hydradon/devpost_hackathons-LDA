                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After struggling to do a simple, single task with Twilio, I decided it would be very helpful if there were an expanded version of the Twilio.org Rapid Response Kit available - A tool that allows users to use the Twilio API to accomplish simple tasks - no coding required.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ReplyGenius at it's core, is an entire easy-to-use framework for Twilio integrations. The integrations that have been implemented so far, are Echo, SMS Forwarding, Slack messaging, Google Spreadsheets (which can be used for gathering feedback, running a sweepstakes contest, survey answers, and Polls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When generating an integration, your phone number is integrated right from ReplyGenius, so you don't need to struggle with figuring out what to put where on the Twilio callbacks page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system will also generate simple usage stats, using data gathered from the Twilio API, and includes the ability to send announcements to all users who have messaged one/all of your integrations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ReplyGenius is built using PHP5.5, Doctrine2, Symfony Components (namely Routing and HTTPFoundation), and the Twilio API.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing the core of the application took much more time than anticipated - I would have liked to have added more integrations.
                </p>

                    It works!
