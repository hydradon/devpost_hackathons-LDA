                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to make this project according to the specifications (specs) described by Citadel Casing Solutions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pipe Out is a mobile app that runs on both iOS and Android that computes dimensions and strengths of steel pipe given limited user input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native and GraphQL to build the app, and PostgreSQL, Node.js, GraphQL, and Express.js for the database and server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into/Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't find a dropdown menu that we liked in React Native, so we coded our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained experience in writing software for a client with needs and use cases, as opposed to writing code for an academic assignment with a rubric.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pipe Out
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If chosen as the winner of the Citadel Casing Solutions, we will move to further development according to specs provided.
