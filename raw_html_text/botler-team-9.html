                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over 590,000 tonnes of food is wasted every year in London alone. Aside from that, the average Londoner spends &pound;1000 per year on takeaways. The obvious step is to cook, however, 1 in 4 Londoners can only cook 3 recipes! This is why we have created BOTler - your on-demand Butler chatbot available through GetRecipie's Facebook page!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BOTler allows you to upload ingredients by typing, taking a photo or selecting from the list of suggestions available. With this information, it will provide you with recipes that you can make with exactly what you have available. If you have some extra ingredients, BOTler will also recommend a side dish! Isn't that amazing? No more waste!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Long story short - as a team!
3 awesome developers + an amazing, creative UX designer.
We've decided to use Python mostly, as well as PyTorch and FB Chatbot functionality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A data scientist, who initially was with us, left the hackathon after and half a day, so we end up with as quickest bootcamp as possible in order to get into PyTorch area.
Nobody from the team had the necessary experience so it was an amazing challenge for all of us
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a solution that actually works! and there is a clear way what to do and how to do in case of continuing working on that bot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the first and the most important thing - TEAM rules! You can achieve everything working with excited, collaborative individuals who support each other and committed to the result! 
We need to understand what we need to do in order to make BOTler in a completed way
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BOTler [Team #9]
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sleepover it, and with fresh power continue working :) at least all of us are in the Slack channel. :)
