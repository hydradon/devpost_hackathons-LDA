                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dragonboards are provided by MLH at most hackathons. Are they good for anything?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It should light up the light strip, but the dragonboard has easy capabilities for wifi and bluetooth so a lot more mobile controls could be added.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    first I looked up the dragon board start guide, then how to SPI with the dragonboard. X
Then I found out SPI is v difficult set up because the guide doesn't work, it  references files that don't exist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dragon board is really  really slow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned more about how SPI works. Found out why people don't use dragonboards at other hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to learn more about different communication protocols, like I2C and SPI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dragon lights
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can't even.
I made a cute light game so there something to demo. 
The game is won by pressing and holding the button when the LED is lit. If you win there is a chime. If you press the button at the wrong time there is an obnoxious buzz.
                    <br>
                    try it out at the demo table!
