                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the availability of thousands of data elements for almost anything out there (demographic, property, weather, risk, social), applications can now leverage this data real-time and embed in any kind of system. Today, IDS, blends data for analytics in Business Intelligence tools; however, we believe that making the third party data available for operational systems can greatly enhance the richness of the processes and the ability for users to make better decisions in real-time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on an address, we pull data from several Data Enrichment APIs (powered by Pitney Bowes, an IDS partner) to showcase the ease of integration of third party data into a process model. In particular, for this exercise, we fetch points of interest data for restaurants that are nearby an address based on the driving distance from the selected address to each restaurant, and also, retrieve all the property (public information) related attributes related to the address (198 different attributes for each address).
                </p>
                <p>
                    An immediate use case we can think about is real-estate, loan approvals, or insurance, where these data elements can be part of the process to review the property characteristics (value, loans, mortgage amount, year purchased, etc.) and also to determine proximity to specific points of interest (shopping malls, restaurants, schools, universities, gas stations, etc.). In this case, we are only showing restaurants; however, there are several hundred different categories of types of points to choose from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using primarily the SAIL forms functionality, using integrations to retrieve the data, and grids to show the data. Then it was all put into a process model to store the information to then report on the process model variables (addresses reviewed) afterwards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting to understand the integrations and how to consume them in a process model was hard to do. Instead, we opted to use the SAIL forms and call the integrations directly from there. Very powerful components with a lot of functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the new Appian Low Code environment and how it works in a very short amount of time. Personally, I remember working entirely in the process model world, with the new Web Service Smart node. However, working with the interfaces and integrations added a tremendous amount of functionality. It was very easy to add the Web Component with the marker for the address we were reviewing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making it all work in a short amount of time; definitely a different application development paradigm. We loved it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot; from the grids, paging, the web component, the integrations, the rules, the process model report, and the report interface, all the way to the application creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When working with integrations and rules, we really liked the ability to perform unit tests right on the interface, without the need to have to get out of the integration of the rule into the interface. This is an extremely powerful feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for IDS - Data Enrichment Platform - Property Details
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to enhance it to include a larger workflow, from a retail, insurance, or loan approval perspective; enhance it with other kinds of data: demographic data, risk data, weather data, and social media data among some others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Data Enrichment Platform should be plug-n-play into existing processes that can benefit from having the extra data to improve the functionality of the process.
