                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were first inspired by the idea when we heard of the applications of the IBM bluemix platform and blockchain. After being exposed to the complexity and possibilities of the platform we were immediately hooked. We thought of our idea due to how we had to make a monthly budget of our expenses as college students and pay for our student loans along with basic necessities. It reminded us of a friend who had his credentials compromised due to a faulty third party software that dealt with EdFinancial Services. Students have enough to stress over in class so we hope this produce can be an asset for the future.

                <p>
                    The front-end is a demonstration of the possibilities that could come about from using this technology in a maintained environment

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I set up the backend server that was the main part of the project. It requires the creation of a blockchain platform instance and extensive configuration of of certificates.
