                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we were thinking about snapKit stories and location tags, and suddenly thought it would be a great idea to get googlemaps search results for a specific region drawn on the map versus searching the whole rectangular region of the phone screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You use your cursor and draw a closed loop on the map, and then enter a particular category of an establishment you are searching for (eg. restaurants) and all restaurants within the enclosed region will be shown.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using google maps api's (Places/map api. . . etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Trying to query too many times in too short a span of time, had to reduce the number of inputs in order to get responses
-Trying to devise a method to retrieve an array of points that comprised of the coordinates within the closed loop drawn. We ended up using a Raycasting algorithm

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we built a webapp that works and could be useful???
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with API's and got a better understanding of the many developer tools on google cloud platform and snapKit etc..

                <h2>
                    What's next for Google Maps Closed Loop Search
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of on web, we build it into a mobile app!!!!

                    INSTRUCTIONS::
When on the googlemaps interface after opening the .html file, hold shift and hover your mouse over a certain region in googlemaps. Preferably the region should not be too big. And you'll see "restaurants" pop up. (The code has been specified for "restaurant" category. You may change it accordingly to the establishment type you desire.
