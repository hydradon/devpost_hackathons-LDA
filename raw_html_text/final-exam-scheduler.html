                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all stressed for upcoming finals.  So instead of studying, Alec thought we should procrastinate and build a program to plan for finals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program takes lets you look through all of the exams and exam times for Missouri S&amp;T so you can display your exams in calendar view. Additionally, it will notify you if your exams are at the same time, and it will even recommend how much you should study for each exam based upon a difficulty rating you give the course.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have moderate experience designing windows applications with Microsoft Visual Studio, so we decided to use Visual Studio as our design platform. We brainstormed what our form needed, and then created a template.  Then we all started collaborating on the code segments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Troubleshooting and debugging usability errors was time consuming and tricky.  Making the form look stylish was the labor of love from Cooper.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us, and Abbie especially are proud of the code, Cooper is super proud of the beautiful face of our program, Kyle is proud of the custom icon he made, and Alec is proud of our team &lt;3
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned some tricks with C#. Especially with managing datagridviews and listviews.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Final Exam Scheduler
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to allow the user to export their exam schedule as a picture, and for the user to be able to save their schedule.  We would also like to implement a way for the user to block off study times on the calendar.
