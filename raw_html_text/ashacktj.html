                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From 2010 to 2017, the homelessness counts in Los Angeles County increased by a staggering 42%, ranking it 2nd in the list of cities with the highest homeless population. It also has the highest percentage of unsheltered homeless citizens then any other city in the United States at 75%. Although New York City has the highest population, its unsheltered percentage is only 5%. A common issue among homeless communities is the lack of awareness of the resources throughout major cities that are provided to ensure their safety and well-being.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This connects people with unstable living conditions to resources such as free clinics, food banks, or community shelters in their city. Once they find the appropriate resource ConnectLA will specify any requirements and provide the directions to the facility.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked on creating an interactive map with markers at a few facilities available throughout Los Angeles, and created a nice website to display this is information.

                <p>
                    There were difficulties with figuring out the Google Maps API.

                <p>
                    We are proud of the website's look as well as the map which is able to hold a lot of information about the specific facilities.
