                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    David and I thought of the idea when we were thinking of ways to make social media more of an intimate experience. The inspiration around the idea is that often times people gather in areas for large events like festivals and a platform like this could easily create an easy way for people to get more involved with other sharing similar experiences in that moment. It's not limited to special events however.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site works using a PHP, CSS, and a mySQL database. Although there's tons of different features that could be incorporated in the site, out tema decided to make a minimum viable product sort of site where we could see if the idea was feasible technically. As of right now, the site is simply a geolocational messaging platform which "unlocks" threads and allows you to participate in them as long as you are within the threads latitude and longitudinal tolerance range (ie involved n the area the thread refers to)
