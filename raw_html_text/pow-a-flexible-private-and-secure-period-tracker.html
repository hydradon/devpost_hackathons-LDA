                    I have always wondered why menstrual tracking apps were so cumbersome and so detailed. Lately, I have been thinking this must be because they want to use the data for something. In February a popular app was caught leaking cycle events to

                        Facebook through analytics
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    This got me thinking, what would I need to learn to be able to create a privacy-first menstrual tracker. This led to me submitting a talk proposal on this topic that was accepted by several conferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A couple of weeks ago when doing research for my talk I came over the Blockstack "Can't be evil" competition. In a major fit of talk procastination, I decided to start creating the tracker I want for myself and my friends.

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        A tracker that lets you take charge of your menstrual cycle.
                    </strong>

                    The user interface has been a challenge. I need it to be super simple, but also super flexible. I landed on using a free text field with support for hashtags. The tags will be used by POW! to predict what a user normally tags on any given day in their cycle. I want a user to quickly get an answer to "Am I feeling hopeless today because of my pesky hormones? Or do I need to figure out what's up?". In addition to being able to look what's in store for future dates to be able to prepare better and be in charge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, I would like to give the users knowledge about the latest research in addition to letting them analyze their tags to see for themselves if there are any important trends.
