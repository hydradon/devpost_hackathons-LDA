                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students who live in student housing, we realized there are a lot of things that needs to be organized around the house. Assigning chores, creating reminder notes and drafting an availability calendar can difficult to balance when accommodating the busy lives of university students. We decided to put all these processes together to create a central system that is easy to access at anytime!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You simply start by creating an account and a household. The rest of your housemates can then register and join that household using a unique invite code. From there you can create a list of tasks to be done around the house and assign housemates to each. You can also write to a messages board that is shared to the entire household.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of trouble with our database structure and accessing its related data, but once we spent enough time to understand how it interacted with our application, it ended up becoming our most notable feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest accomplishments as a team was overcoming the difficulties of the database. Once the structure was created in a way that the application could use it effectively, it simplified the process of creating messages, tasks, and houses. This allowed us to add more features than we were expecting. We are also proud of our ability to work as a team and motivate each other. We divided the work among our team to play off each other's strengths and continued to remain focus from beginning to end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about software development using django and dealing with a postgresql database. None of us had used these technologies in the past, and using them at DeltaHacks gave us a good understanding of how the framework works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Student House Manager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue to add a more efficient method to insert calendars. We have a few ideas on how to merge schedules and display different class times for each person in the house using google calendars. Other ideas included auto email notifications for chore deadlines, chore rotation for specified weekly tasks and a way to keep track of total house productivity. This would help develop the productivity side of our application to an even higher level
