                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a professor whose face we've always wanted to spray paint (not of it, but on it). While this would resolve many built up sentiments that have festered from a semester or two, it is rather impractical. So instead, we decided to create this site as the second best.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the former "Draw Your Professor" website, our site provides users with a clean canvas to explore all their artistic rage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are able to draw your professors on an HTML canvas element (which is also mobile friendly). Professors have to be identified via Rate My Professor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and Javascript for the frontend of the website and PHP as the backend. DrawProf was designed to be mobile friendly so additional support for mobile canvas interactions was needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty creating showcase-friendly drawings of our favorite professors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile friendliness was harder than expected due to additional event handlers needed to support touch events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how entertaining it could be to draw your professors online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DrawProf
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to implement a greater filtering system for searching your favorite professors by name and by their university. Additionally, we plan on supporting a wider range of colors so more stunning drawings can be achieved.
