                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to improve the way people in general find affordable housing such as apartments since there are so many apartment buildings that simply don't have their listings available in the more common websites like Craigslist, Zillow, etc. We wanted to create a website that was interactive and easy to navigate in order to better find housing.

                <p>
                    The data scraper and web crawler took a very long time to run as well as being fairly delicate and needing to cover a lot of cases.
