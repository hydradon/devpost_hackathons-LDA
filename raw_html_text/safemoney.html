                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to develop an application that fused together the Nessie API from Capital One with crime datasets of Booz Allen Hamilton. We developed an application that allows the public to search by zipcode to find the safest ATM in their region.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user visits this website:
                    <a href="https://buttcamp2015-ooshy.c9.io/" rel="nofollow">
                        https://buttcamp2015-ooshy.c9.io/
                    </a>
                    .  From here, they can enter in a zipcode (currently DC zipcodes are all that will work). After hitting enter, they are taken to a results page that displays the safest ATMs in the provided zipcode's area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult leading a team to deliver the final product. There were a mixed-bag of skills, and it was the first hackathon for all of us. We are really tired.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact we were able to build the website using only a few tools, including bootstrap, python w/ flask, javascript, and postgresql.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that working 36 hours straight is hard to do. Getting into a better sleep/work cycle may have given us an advantage. I learned how to decode JSON data, and how to send web api requests from a programming language.
                </p>

                    What's next for SafeMoney

                <p>
                    There is much to be implemented to have a modern and complete user experience. Currently the main feature that works successfully is the ability to enter in a zipcode (such as 20001), and be redirected to a page that shows an organized list (by safety) of atms within the area of that zipcode. Other features such as a better display of the data and a "directions to atm" are yet to be implemented.
