                    As students living on/near a college campus, we are very aware of how relevant the issue of sexual assault is to our community. A number of us have personal connections to this topic and we all have close relationships with someone who has been subjected to sexual misconduct or assault. The prevalence of this issue in our community got us thinking about how we can help support victims/survivors and create further preventative measures - and with our shared passion for technology and some serious brainstorming, we developed the idea for tool: SAVE, a web application that provides victims/survivors a reporting service for sexual harassment cases so that they can be made aware of repeat offenders and be connected to other resources.

                <p>
                    We spent our first several hours brainstorming ways to improve user experience and make sure our users felt comfortable using the tool. After mocking up the different pages for our web app, we created a Django project. We split up the work by front-end and back-end.

                <p>
                    Some challenges we faced included getting acclimated to the Django interface, as well as connecting our back-end to our front end.

                    Overall, it was a fantastic learning experience and we are excited to share our creation with you.
