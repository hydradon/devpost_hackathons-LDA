                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music brings people together. By creating this new way for people to share their own musical experiences with each other, we are bringing the world's peoples together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Vive controller plays musical notes reminiscent of the sound of a violin. The height of the controller determines the pitch, and the velocity determines the volume (similar to the way a violin's bow requires movement in order to create sound). The locations of the notes are clearly visible, allowing new learners of the Viveolin to pick up the basics quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTC Vive and Unity
None of our team members had significant experience with Unity, so we had to learn how to create the 3D environment from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented many features that real musical instruments have, such as a rich range of dynamics and the ability to play using multiple articulations, such as legato vs staccato. The left controller reaches a lower set of notes than the right controller, so the total range of the instrument is expanded. Also, using both controllers at the same time allows 2-note chords, harmonies, and even counterpoint (for the particularly skilled musician).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to repeatedly test and tweak our app in order to create a satisfying experience that the user will want to engage in again and again.
                </p>
