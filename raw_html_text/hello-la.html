                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a variety of travel sites, such as tripadvisor, airbnb as well as restaurant ranking systems such as Yelp. However, we wanted to create a personalized system that combined the two elements of each of these systems in a fun, playful, and aesthetically pleasing way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hello LA is a inside guide to Los Angeles. It is a guide to the best attractions, curated by locals. It is broken into five main categories: eat, explore, learn, party, and shop. It is designed to have a personalized feel, headlined by the question, "What do you want to do?"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided our team into three main sections: research, development, and design. We had 3 developers and two designers on the team, and split up the work between ourselves. While the developers structured the back end, the designers created graphic elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a surprisingly low amount of problems, even in this constrained time restrictions. Our main focus was keeping the lines of communication clear among designers and developers and double checking to make sure our wireframes and ideas were possible. We also had a few tech hiccups creating the website and getting everything to lay out correctly, however our developers were able to collaborate together and problem solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall we are very proud of the project as a whole. We all brought a unique skill to the table and we were able to work together and create a product that was responsive, unique, and well designed. Our unique combination of design and development is our achievement we are most proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to divide and conquer in a collaborative environment, and work together as a team to achieve a common goal. For most of us this was our first hackathon, as well as working on a project with this fast of a turnaround.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hello LA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we are hoping to expand to other cities, and create more curated guides for both tourists and locals.
