                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a fun game that inspires the user to get to understand a small town.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enters the user in a virtual reality world in which they journey through the map and find ducks. They must make sure to watch for buses!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to create this fun and intriguing game, we used unity to make the map. We coded scripts for our buses and ducks in C#. We modeled our classroom by inputting around 200 pictures into Autodesk ReMake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Where to start... We had trouble with mesh colliders because, whenever the object would collide the game would crash. Picking items up, they stuck to the controller, not allowing us to throw them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a pretty fun vr game that incorporates a lot of interesting scripting for collisions.
