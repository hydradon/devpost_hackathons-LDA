                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all in one of our most stressful semesters, flying in and out constantly in between school assignments and major cramming for technical interviews. One of the biggest pains was having to carry around heavy books or always have 50 tabs open for practicing our programming skills. What if we had a super simple and straightforward app for easy interview prep? So easy that you could practice your coding skills in line for coffee, waiting for your airplane, or even minutes before you step into that interview room. Thus HacklineBling was born.

                    HacklineBling will generate a programming question based on your preferences such as "Anything," "Arrays," "LinkedList," etc. Then, the user will type in their pseudocode and/or hardcode into the app. After the she's done, HacklineBling displays the answer next to your own answer, allowing her to easily compare and learn!
