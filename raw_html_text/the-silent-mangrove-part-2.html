                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by games like RainWorld and Turtle Tale, a 3DS homebrew game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, the character can move around and collisions are detected with other objects. The animations are partially working for the main character
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using a port of the Love2D framework for the 3DS, LovePotion
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This framework, especially the 3DS port, is largely undocumented and many things are missing from the regular Love2D framework. For example, there is no collision library so we had to determine an efficient way to handle collisions ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pixel art we've worked on as well as getting as far as we have with the game itself. Given that there aren't many titles like this, there is little documentation and a lot of experimentation had to be done to get a lot of things working. In addition, neither of us are game developers by nature, so learning game design concepts was also a first for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a continuation of our last project, we learned that making a game in uncharted territory takes a lot longer than a single hackathon or even probably a game jam allows for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Silent Mangrove (Part 2)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to continue working on the art, of course, but the majority of what we have left is the actual programming of the game. We need to finish working on the sprites and animations for the entities, as well as the AI for the enemies and the different scenes.
