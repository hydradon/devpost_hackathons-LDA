                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an artillery game based on trajectories, but we thought that current games did not focus on the topic of trajectories. Since it is nearing Thanksgiving, we decided to design the player, projectiles, and the powerups to fit around the theme of Thanksgiving.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a trajectory-based artillery game in which one player will battle another using a controller with ultrasonic and joystick detectors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Arduino to create a controller that accepts distance and angle parameters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing an LCD display.
Battling lag.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working together as a new team.
Trying new ideas such as calculating trajectories based on input values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about trig and how to deal with a window that is larger than fullscreen mode in pygame.
                </p>

                    What's next for Turkey Toss
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add an LCD display to the actual controller so that the user does not have to look at the computer screen to input values to the program and instead can look at the controller.
Get rid of lag.
