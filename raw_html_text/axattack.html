                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It detects when a person is having an Anxiety Attack through the built in heart sensor and motion sensor. Once detected the device feeds the user with breathing techniques, music, calm pictures, and the opption to text a friend for support.
