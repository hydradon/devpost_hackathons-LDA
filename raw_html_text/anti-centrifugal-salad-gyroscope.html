                    Inspiration Inspired by our various methods of mixing salad in our college dining hall, we seek to find the most effective way to spin your salad!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does All you need to do is to put your ingredients in a bowl! Once your food is safely secured, a mere push of a button will spin your ingredients through three different axes to put a new spin on your salad.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this device using a variety of different technologies, such as Autodesk Fusion 360, MakerBots, and laser cutting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several challenges to get all of the moving parts and concentric rings to fit into each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are super proud to present a functioning, 3-axis rotational system to spin your salad! We got the parts to fit together to make the rings move seamlessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about problem solving midway through a design and more about general fabrication techniques.

                    What's next for Anti-Centrifugal Salad Gyroscope
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Anti-Centrifugal Salad Gyroscope will be made more versatile! We envision adding a heat element to cook stir fry, a mode to peel garlic, or even a method to evenly mix your favorite granola!
