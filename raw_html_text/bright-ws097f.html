                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Although each of us are personally driven, we still have a difficult time locating opportunities within campus. A few who are unable to receive experience through internship sought out workshops, hackathons, and conferences, but it's been a very inconvenient process. We want to be able to create a platform, where students (especially the ones not familiar with the campus) can take advantage of all these "hidden opportunities" and grow as a professional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Bright++ is an application that calls geolocation data from Mapbox API and allows for real-time updating of the target's location. We also bring in the idea of mixed reality to gamify tasks in an engaging way. The quests will be generated at various "points of interest." For example, our app may direct you to GSU's EXLab to rent a Raspberry Pi and complete an AI project. These tasks are geared towards building technological skills, so as the user complete these quests, their experience bars will populate accordingly. Our system is designed as a resource for students to enforce what they've learnt in lecture, which will be backed up by concrete data that we can analyze to measure effectiveness.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                    <li>
                        The problem statement: There are many opportunities scattered throughout campus; however, students may not be aware. This often leads to a perceived negative college experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We considered the lengths at which students have to go through to locate these opportunities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We defined each component of the app, grouped them for script-writing, and designated tasks for efficiency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We built our entire app on Unity and referenced API data to build a location-based game.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We ran into a large learning curve. It was all of our first time at hackathon with very minimum experience, so essentially we learned each language and framework as we encountered many obstacles while developing the code and application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -It's not perfect, but we manage to create a rough prototype of our general goal for the app. Regardless, we learned a lot in the process, so with that mentality, we managed to stay optimistic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We learned the important of the planning process. Once we determine how the platforms communicate with one another, the code-writing aspect followed after we defined the sub-tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bright++
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -After testing and improving our app, we will release it to GSU students. The long-term goal is to deploy it to other campuses with a competitive aspect.
