                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After going to many music festivals and events, I grew tired of needing to download separate apps for each event. Therefore, RaveMom was created. In a group of friends, you would call the person who knows all the information about the event the "Rave Mom"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After signing into your social media account, you would be able to search for upcoming music festivals and events and RSVP to them. Once RSVP, you would be able to access the map of the event which showcases all the different amenities of the festival, such as where the different stages are and where the restrooms are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native in order to build a mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we wanted to use Snapchat's developer Snapkit. However, we found out that Snapkit only worked with Android and IOS developer tools, not React. Therefore, we had to switch gears and create our own login system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had barely any experience using React Native, so we were proud that we were able to get the app to be functional. We are also proud of the branding, theme and color scheme of the app. We are hoping that the retro dark theme would fit with the theme of music festivals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use React Native and React Native API. We also learned how to implement firebase in order for the mobile app to compile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RaveMom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we would like to have the app fully functional and we want people to be able to sign in through their social media accounts.
