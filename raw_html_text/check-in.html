                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from two sources - hackathon buses and t-shirt lines. Varun and Jay have been bus captains, and keeping track of people was a nightmare. What if there was a way to quickly validate riders and keep track of them?
T-Shirt giveaway lines can be long because hackathon organizers (rightfully so) confirm each attendee before handing out a shirt. Why does it have to be so cumbersome?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is simple and effective - if you are hosting an event that requires you to keep track of attendees, invite them to join Events. Each user has a QR Code generated that you can scan, quickly "checking in" the user to that event. Have users hopping onto a bus? Scan their code as they get on, you can quickly check who's there and who's not. Giving away free t-shirt? Keep track of how many times they have

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're writing an Android app and using a QR Code library for the scanning process. A web portal for users allows admins to create and monitor events. A PHP Laravel RESTful API on AWS / Ubuntu manages a MySQL database and securely serves data to clients. A Pebble Watch client also displays the QR Code for the scanning process.

                <p>
                    Pranav: facing specific challenges with interfacing Angular.js with our RESTful API, handling asynchronous calls and managing specific data as cookies, CORS issues when integrating with Laravel!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Varun: none - he's counting his blessings!

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really excited that we have multiple client-facing products that we were able to integrate, making for a really cool system. We feel that it flows really nicely and we were able to do so with relatively little friction, fast debugging and overall strong teamwork! Go team!
