                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the different FinTech companies at Technica to hack something to manage finances and investments in an interactive and engaging platform. I wanted to build something to help people with minimal financial literacy make good decisions and goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a social media and dashboard hub to see your savings, finance goals, and investments. You can explore your feed to see what your friends are investing in, or news they are sharing regarding finance related topics. You can build your dashboard with different widgets depending on your goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to prototype the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I initially had 2 other teammates to work with, but unfortunately they left the event early. I had some issues setting up the hosting on GCP and the domain, since this usually takes 24-48hrs to make changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about bootstrap, which is a front end tool I've been wanting to gain expereience with. I really like the creativity and applicability of the idea as well. Especially the social idea, since it generates discussion about thinking about your finance and investment goals, and you can follow people you are interested in to have guidance/inspiration.
