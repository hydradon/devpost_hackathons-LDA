                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was said that during the last election in the United States, over 50% of the political content consumed by the average person was considered to be fake news.  This misinformation often came in the form of eye-catching advertisement articles or videos posted on Facebook.  Youtube began an initiative to link to wikipedia articles on conspiracy-related YouTube videos, which is very surface level.  We wanted a more broad solution that can extend beyond conspiracies and even beyond politics to act as a generic fact source.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Block Fax takes in a video link, plays the video on the left half of your screen and pulls up relevant information on the right side of your screen.  Being presented with a video and accepted to be true articles, the user can then sign off on a video with their public key for the Algorand blockchain.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by creating a web app with node.js that utilizes youtube and wikipedia APIs for data presentation, and works with Microsoft Azure for text to main topic conversion.  The blockchain technology used is built on Algorand.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into accessibility issues with all of the different APIs.  Additionally, we had no prior blockchain knowledge so understanding it was difficult.
