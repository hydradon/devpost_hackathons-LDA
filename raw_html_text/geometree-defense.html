                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were discussing about what our project would be, and all of us quickly came to the agreement that making a game would be the most enjoyable for us. Since we all had enjoyed tower defense games when we were younger, we decided to make our own, and see what we could accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a tower defense game involving simple geometry shapes. There are two different types of towers, lasers and cannons, which have different costs and damage potential to allow for more strategy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The one language that we collectively all knew the best was Java. We used Processing to create visual graphics and game play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many syntax errors, and there were also little bugs that we had to constantly fix. Because we formulated our plans in pseudo-code before executing, the execution did not prove to be a big challenge. However, there were many unintended nuances of the code that we had to fix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of Java and Processing syntax, and we are very proud to have created a working tower defense game that we all could enjoy playing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more Java, Processing, and using coordinates of objects to manipulate animations and game play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Geometree Defense
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had more time, we would definitely have added more towers and different types of "minions". We would introduce mechanics such as area-of-effect damage, and improve our animations. Looking even further ahead, we would have even made a sequel.
