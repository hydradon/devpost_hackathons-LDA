                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Electronic devices have taken over all of humanity. No matter how miraculous and meticulous their applications can be, over-dosage of even humor makes you irritated, imagine what slavery to electronics can do to you. Moreover, the minimum average age-group to own mobile phones is falling down drastically. This doesn't just makes our kids addicted to technology, but even hampers their physical activeness, which can be very harmful in the longer run. This is high-time that we detoxify ourselves from all the over-dosage of mobile phones, computers, internet, games, or we call it, De-techxify
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    De-Techxify is a human-friendly android application which monitors your daily/weekly/monthly activities on the mobile phone, which involves monitoring all the social media applications, texting applications, and all other custom applications that tend to keep you busy, when you shouldn't actually be. This gives you a clearer picture of how to organize and utilize your time better. The data collected by the application is saved over the cloud, so that you can access it over the internet at any place you are and monitor yourself, or your loved ones, without exactly physically being present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to develop the front and backend of the android application. Rest-full service was developed using Spring Boot and Java. AWS' EC2 cloud service was used for hosting the web-service and database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting to EC2 virtual machine was a huge pain, even with the amount of documentation available related to the topic. Android studio, well known for anonymous and unjustified random error generation was the main villain in the whole pursuit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to develop a decent UI for the android app with the given shortage of time. Developing restful service successfully was another accomplishment that made us proud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though spreading the application across the platforms is a challenging enough task, it's advantages are way more than and worth taking the pain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for De-Techxify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the database as a restful service, it can be spread all over the available publishing platforms, be it web applications, Hardware devices, etc. We can monitor and deploy a controlled usage environment for the betterment of humanity
