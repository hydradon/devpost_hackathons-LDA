                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, there is so much access to data in the world. In past years, the problem for many researchers was that they didn't have easy access to data but nowadays it's the exact opposite. To help sort through the data in the world, we developed JMore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JMore takes in an audio input and a reading level, and depending on what is spoken on the audio file (for example a physics lecture which is converted using speech to text) and the given reading level, JMore will return a list of links that are relevant to the audio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it largely on python and flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have used flask before and it was really difficult to understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we got it all working in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that flask is a versatile tool and are more inclined to use it in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JMore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we are planning on improving the speech to text and the quality of the links that are shown to the user.
