                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The EPA estimates that standard shower heads use 2.5 gallons of water per minute. For a 20 minute shower, that could mean over 50 gallons of water wasted (ノ_・。)! Additionally, delivering, treating, and heating the hot water is also extremely energy intensive. Using less water will lower not only lower energy costs, but also keep it in the environment for natural geological and ecological cycles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shawā helps users become aware of how long they spend in showers, and help them adjust to incrementally shorter shower times. Users can choose their favorite playlists to play, and how long they would like to spend in a shower. After that amount is up, the music will stop. There is a short grace period for users to step into the shower, and audible warnings before time is up. Shawā compiles the user's shower data to create visuals for them to track their progress and encourage them to save water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built with Xcode and Swift. We used Firebase for data storage, as well as Gimp to create mockups and visuals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team struggled with finding consistent wifi. This led us to staying at a nearby grocery store for an entire day, where grocery shoppers could watch us code while they picked up bread and eggs as early as 5am.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three strangers from different high schools across the country were able to come together and tackle a real-world problem. Although we all felt intimidated at times, the fact that we were able to code a real app felt truly empowering. For one of our members, it was her first hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the hackathon, we had overly ambitious goals that were simply too much for 3 teenagers to make in 36 hours. We learned to scale our project down, and have a solid MVP before adding more features. One team member had to update XCode, which was a process that spanned around 5 hours. She learned to update all software

                    coming to a hackathon :-).

                <h2>
                    What's next for Shawā
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to expand beyond Apple Music to allow users to connect their Spotify playlists with the platform. Additionally, we're considering adding social leaderboards for users to compare their shower times with their friends' for friendly competition and further motivation (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧.
