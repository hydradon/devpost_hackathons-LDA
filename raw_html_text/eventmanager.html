                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt like Facebook and other event advertising sites made it difficult to put focus on the events themselves.  This allows club members to directly advertise events from their phone without the hassle of other sites.  More importantly students can see all of the events in one place and manage their schedule easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a platform that takes in events from club managers and automatically updates the app to include these events.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used firebase as a database and android studio.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the whole android development process and firebase in 36 hours.

                    What's next for EventManager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to add notifications and allow users to favourite which events they want to attend.
We can also connect their chosen events with their google calendar.
