                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are passionate about coding and enjoy solving puzzles. We wanted to practice our coding skills while still challenging ourselves to recreate difficult algorithms in an easy to use website format. Building different algorithms and learning about cryptology throughout this project helped us find a new love for coding.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cryptomania is a library of multiple different ciphers that are easy for anyone to use. It has the ability to encrypt and decrypt using tons of different methods.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After starting with a dry bootstrap format, we added the javascript functions for encrypting and decrypting the files to allow users to manipulate their text input. We implemented an Amazon Server and used node.js to deploy the website.

                <p>
                    We are hoping to finish up some UI formatting that allows the user to switch immediately back and forth between encrypting and decrypting. In the near future, we are looking to constantly be adding different ciphers and formats to the website. Long term, we are hoping to create a major decryption search that allows it to search for most likely deciphered solutions and what the encrypted phrase most likely is using the Merriam-Webster API as a word checker.
