                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A week before the Hackathon event, I was invited to attend an Asian Pacific Islanders &amp; Asian Americans conference where I learned a lot about the hidden narratives and experiences of Asian ancestry. A lot of individuals often cited having mental health struggles and even a lack of community when relating to personal experiences. At this Hackathon event, I decided to work on a front-end webpagethat could potentially be leveraged into an organization or program in the future that may positively impact community members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of right now, it is only a front-page display with contact information so that individuals on the webpage may contact for additional information. I intend for it to be used as a tool for others to reach out and new features could be added to it in the future in waves as updates where necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this webpage using the NameCheap promotion that was advertised by a sponsor at the event. Thanks to NameCheap, I was able to access their site building tool and secure hosting and domain name as well in the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not run into much challenges that could not be solved with a quick search for the documentation. Since I utilized different tools on a single platform, it was pretty easy to navigate through the same set of documentation and learn different sections of it to access what I needed. For example, while trying to figure out why my webpage would not load outside of the builder, I realized it needed an SSL certification so that it becomes a trusted website when others try to access it.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to build the entire page in a few short hours. This is a great feat for me personally as even businesses may take weeks to months with professional support to figure out how to set up a website. Additionally. I did not have to spend anything for the platform and development of this project. Rather, I figured out how to do it one step at a time and got it to a stage where it is observable and basic functions usable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that it is very possible to develop something that functions at a basic level very rapidly through just following the documentations and putting in the work. I learned about the features on the NameCheap platform that now I can use in the future for other projects as well.
