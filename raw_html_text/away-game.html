                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Travis wants to see his Sox on the road, and Justin takes at least one road trip a year to see the Dodgers in a new city.  We want to see more ballparks, reconnect with disparate friends, and watch baseball in real-life on our terms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Away Game pulls your team's schedule, lets you pick a date, and then
                    <em>
                        finds the airline flights and MLB game tickets
                    </em>
                    you need.   It links to the airline carriers found to buy flights and SeatGeek to buy game tickets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data sources:
                    <br>
                    QPX Express API (public flight data)
SeatGeek API (tickets, schedules, venues)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back End:
Rest API calls for data.  Python/Flask app to process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Front End:
Angular to display results, allow user to pick dates/flights/tickets.  Angular Material for aesthetics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rate-limiting on QPX API.  Calendar integration.  Time crunch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took a stab at real flight data, real games, and got a prototype up and running!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although flight data itself is easy to find, booking travel is more complicated than you'd expect.   Justin learned about flask/angular.  To do this seriously, it would make sense for an existing travel site (required infrastructure and data, private flight data, too)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Away-Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Live data sources.
Richer calendar integration for game selection/flight selection (place games on a calendar).
Full return trip booking.
Share itinerary with friends.   We want to encourage others to come with. 
Housing options, Tilt to consider sharing fees.
