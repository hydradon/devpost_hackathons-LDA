                    Our inspiration for creating this project was a need we saw in the local community. One of our group members is majoring in the healthcare field and noticed the lack of accessible spaces in the community for those with sensory processing disorders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app we've created seeks to ameliorate this problem. Unipen is Yelp meets a community site for people with these challenges. Users will be able to search locations in the local community and look at reviews written by both adults with sensory processing disorders and parents of children with these disorders. Users will also be able to enter a location and add their own reviews. Reviewers will be able to rate locations (restaurants, museums, theaters, etc.) based on noise level, crowding, lighting, and visual input. They will also be able to add an optional written description.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to create an Android app using Java and XML for the layout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some challenges that we ran into were deciding on a name for the app that would easily describe what we trying to do with the app. We also ran into problems creating the database connection. Most other challenges were small hiccups in making the design of the app that were fairly easy to solve with some effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having been able to create an app that can be used practically to help a group of people and create a community that is more accessible for everyone. It was very motivating to be able to try and approach a relevant problem in a unique way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how working as a multidisciplinary team can help when doing app development. We had a diverse group of people working on this project, and that really helped us improve what we were doing. We had two people with a good knowledge of programming, someone with knowledge of community healthcare needs, and a member who is an excellent graphic designer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are excited about future possibilities with UniPin. We would be very interested in adding to the design of the app to make it more versatile and user-friendly. We would like to integrate a map so that users can access more locations without having to manually enter them.
