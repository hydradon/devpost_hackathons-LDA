                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were walking outside the colliseum when the idea hit us, a community driven Lost and Found that could help people come together when it came to losing items regardless of where they lost it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After you log into our system, you either be looking for an item or posting  one to the community. Where you will put in such data as what it was, where, and a description to help retrieve said item.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this we started with what we knew, which we thought was web development. Using Bootstrap for initial design and CSS for formatting changes. For the Back End it began with SQL and later evolved to include PHP. This includes the reading of plenty of documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    .Long story short, we did not know how to use API's in the first place. Our biggest challenge was finding the correct documentation and tutorials to assist us in developing our application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge included the usage of Jquery for the first time in our projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the accomplishments in our project came from long hours of reading, learning, crying, and self pity. Although the obstacles were painful to overcome, both big and small, our team found our greatest accomplishments in our capability to work as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hackathon was a learning experience for all of us; from new languages to new implementations of a previously known language.
                </p>

                    What's next for FndIt!

                <p>
                    We plan on building on top of our current foundation and optimize it into a mobile app.
