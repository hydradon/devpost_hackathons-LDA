                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had been learning about chatbots in class and how people try to use them to win the Loebner prize by making them as human-like as possible.  We found this super cool and wanted to try building something of our own with them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes text based input and teaches the user the moves to the hokey pokey, you can go step by step repeating them if necessary if you didn't unnderstand something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node.js to create waterfall based dialogs and created and trained in LUIS one of Microsoft's language understanding frameworks to allow it to converse more naturally and take a range of inputs while employing machine learning to better interpret people's input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges connecting the online version because we were not sure how to format the keys.  We also wanted to put it on Hololens but were unable to get the robot to read the responses even though it was able to connect to our LUIS and interpret what we said.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing the project using Javascript and Node.js without and background.  And that we were able to change the project's goal without panicking when we learned that certain things we wanted to do were not possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to write in Javascript using Node.js, how to use LUIS's machine learning and the potential it has, a lot about implementing holograms for the hololens and about the Microsoft bot framework in general
                </p>

                <p>
                    Adding compatibility for hololens and adding multiple dances and commands.
