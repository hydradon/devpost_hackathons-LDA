                    A group of a first years, where three fourths of team only having less than a year of experience in c++, went on a journey to broaden their skills and horizons. The team met up at 5 the day of registration, instantly agreeing on an idea. The project will push the team to their edge using different coding languages with extensive object orientated architecture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team decided to use angular to create a web based queue system based on making the user experience easy and allow workers to easy pull from the list. The team ran into a lot of problems getting the project started that ended up with a three hour tutorial. From there on, we divided the project individually slowly building the project from ground up. When a member accomplished their goal. They instantly pushed their project to git and the entire team integrated their work into one.
                </p>

                    We are highly proud of the product we made with the our backgrounds. There was a lot of struggles, but from dedication and teamwork. The team pulled through, creating a piece of work that we'll cherish for life.
