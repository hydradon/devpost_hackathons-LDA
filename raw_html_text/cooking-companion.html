                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The want, the need, and the curiosity of doing this project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses a spy-cam to capture pictures of a receipt. Then using Matlab functions UPC(Universal Product Codes) are read off of the picture. After the UPC codes are cross referenced with a produce database a search is conducted to find recipes with the ingredients. This web page is then displayed to the user.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split into two groups at the start of the hack-athon. One group worked on the Matlab code while the other worked on the Dragonboard 410c interface with the Adafruit Camera.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to get the dragon board to connect to the camera was a challenge as well as accessing the advanced Matlab functions.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a working receipt scanner.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we can have fun and work as a team on in depth software projects as well as how to balance between work and play.

                    What's next for Cooking Companion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps stronger building material and further integration of the full computing power of the dragonboard.
