                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this app in an effort to provide an introduction to Web Development to 3 of our 4 team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows the user to Buy and Sell stocks and review a portfolio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a NodeJS REST API on a Google VM Machine (Linux/Debian) and backed it with a MongoDB database. We had a Python Flask framework that was making calls to our REST API and templates them into Bootstrap templates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with learning MongoDB as we were used to relational databases. Templating and frameworks were very new to most on our team, so understanding the concept surrounding it to execute was a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all definitely built an appreciation for Web Development:
