                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our time at UCLA, we have noticed that finding new people to study with in our classes is somewhat difficult. As a result, StudyUp is our solutions to this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StudyUp allows students to join groups for the class they are taking and collaborate with other students.  Within groups, students are able to set up times to meet and upload files to share.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The programming languages we used were JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. For the backend, we used Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our project, we frequently ran into problems with git merge conflicts, which considerably slowed our progress. We were over to able to overcome these git merge conflicts with the help of mentors and careful debugging.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, we gained huge insights into web development. We learned how various HTML/CSS linked together with JavaScript to form a comprehensive web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StudyUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving on, we would like to implement more features for groups. Some additional functionalities would include a discussion forum and chat system.
