                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do a VR pong game but didn't know which environment for it to be set in...Kent Hack Enough participants wanted a Space theme and we think we delivered!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a VR game that keeps track of your score based on the number of balls you get in a cup (also depends on which cups you make).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built objects in blender, sketchup, and Google Blocks VR and imported them to Unity to use for the game. The game is basically just a bunch of pre-positioned objects with gravity that we manipulate with c# scripts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Pairing the oculus touch controllers with Unity and being able to utilize them.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Getting the score to increment properly (since anytime you cloned an object it didn't associate the object with our score-incrementing script.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unity and Blender hate each other. (When importing objects from Blender to Unity, it would leave out the objects materials and we'd have to manually import them and re-link the materials)
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Making the VR game function properly, including the physics, collision detection, and logic for grabbing, throwing, dropping, and manipulating the objects in all ways. 
## What I learned
Learned a lot about how Unity interacts with the oculus touch controllers. 
Learned about game development design in general (make the game function, then make it pretty)
Learned how to effectively work with a team on a VR game and debug together. 
## What's next for SpacePongVR
We're planning on still including more in the game including music, aliens, other space objects, etc. Anything to make the feel that your in Space more realistic and anything to improve the fun of the game for the future.
