                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A 2016 report by RSA found that 27% of all electronic crime were suspected or known to be caused by insiders. Furthermore, 30% of the damage done by insiders were worse than damage done by outsiders. Our goal was to use behavioral biometrics to determine if an unauthorized user is accessing a computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Koios is tool which collects mouse movement and keyboard clicks. Information such as velocity, acceleration, curvature, and even the time you hold a mouse button down is collected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Koios IO monitor program is built using C. The graphical user interface is made with JavaFX, and the processing is handled through Python, Pandas, and Numpy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we tried to implement the IO monitor using Python, but this was too slow. We opted with C (using X11) and used a special software tool to attach the monitor to a CPU.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting enough user data in a 24 hour time period is hard and studies have shown that in order to reduce the false acceptance rate and false rejection rate to ~2% we would have needed around 12 hours of data from each participant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initial tests show that even though we do not have near enough data, a model is able to somewhat learn. The biggest hurdle was turning the raw data (x,y, timestamp etc) into usable data for our model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keras, Pandas, JavaFX, Numpy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Koios
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we need to gather enough data to confidently use the model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we would have liked to allow easy deployment and the ability to securely email a system admin when an anomaly is detected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like to combine this technology with One-Shot-Learning, which is commonly used in facial recognition.
