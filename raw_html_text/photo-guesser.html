                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something cool and neat!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the last working code we made in Android studio to show basic Android app functions.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Unclear deadlines/expectations as to what we were going to do/progress towards
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Realizing that Snapkit was not the augmented reality mobile solution we were looking for
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Understanding that Unity engine requires the skill of full on game development, and 4 hours of our time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Android studio is much harder than it seems.
