                    CampusCompass is a website that allows for users to share events to their college campus.  These posted events, along with pertinent information, appear on the website's map while they are ongoing, so that college students can be connected to what events are currently happening on campus.

                    The purpose of CampusCompassnis to provide a platform to crowd source information about events on campus happening in real time, so users may more easily connect with fundraisers, pick-up sports games, and other events on campus.

                    We divided the program into three subproblems.  One group worked on understanding the Google Maps API and implementing it with JavaScript and HTML.  Another group focused on creating a database with MongoDB and Flask on the back end.  The remaining member of our team focused on the webpage design and data entry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was the first hackathon for all five members of our team and when combining our subproblems, we ran into difficulties making the front end and back end meet.  We attempted our best to reconcile the work on the back end for the database, but ended up scrapping it and hardcoding a miniature database to pull data from for the demo.

                    The subgroup working on the Google Maps aspect of this hack had never used either JavaScript or any API before, so for them, successfully comprehending and implementing it in our program was a huge victory.  We managed to incorporate the webdesign with the Google Maps page to have the entire front end run together and look nice.  Overall, our team considered this a successful hack, ultimately being able to successfully produce a functioning demo in the limited time frame.
