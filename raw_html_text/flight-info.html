                    Everyone knows the feeling of sitting on a plane in the dark, wondering why they are going nowhere, have not taken off, have been taxiing for an hour, or maybe have landed but cannot get off. We created a program to avoid this problem, by allowing flight attendants to easily, electronically send this information to the passengers.
