                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You should be able to quickly tell what another team is doing. Using machine learning maybe you can.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A person would plug in 5 signals and find out what that sign might mean
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We generated a bunch of test data of signs to simulate recording previously done signals. Then trained a tensorflow model which can predict what a series of signals might mean.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew nothing about tensorflow or machine learning at the beginning of the day. But we powered through and learned a lot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have something that if we had real data could in theory... work
                </p>
