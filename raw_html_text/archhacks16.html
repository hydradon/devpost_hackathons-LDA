                </h1>
                <p>
                    This is our hackathon project for ArchHacks 2016. We were initially working on a hardware project that was scrapped after realizing that we didn't have a couple of pieces of important hardware. So we created Dr. AI in the last 10 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    So what is Dr. AI?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dr. AI aims to reduce the noise and clutter in YOUR visits to the Doctor. We are using state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques/APIs to help sick patients get diagnosed from the comfort of their home. Dr. AI is a chatbot that will take your particulars and symptoms and connect you with a real doctor that will use our pre-calculated diagnosis to quickly and accurately diagnose you. If necessary, the doctor might also recommend the patient to visit a doctor in-person or a pharmacy with a prescription. For this, we identify the users' location and suggest the 5 best doctors in the vicinity according to the diagnosis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, we have a bot that diagnoses a patient based on the personal details and symptoms.
