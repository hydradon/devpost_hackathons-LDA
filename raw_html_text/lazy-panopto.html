                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are students that don't like to go to class. Also, sometimes it is difficult to create notes for lectures when professors talk quickly or incoherently. We wanted to create a way to transcribe their lectures on Panopto and summarize them or be able to translate them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transcribes the speech of professors on Panopto and transcribes the images/slides of Panopto into text, with features available such as summarization and translation.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the issue of incorporating all of our features together(i.e. speech-to-text, translation, summarization, and image-to-text). Also, we ran into the issue of accessing our server through https.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the various google apis, namely Speech-to-Text and other Cloud Intelligence Apis. Also, we learned about using Flask as a framework for web development.
