                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Who among us has not paid $6.50 for a 5-minute Uber ride from the dorms to CVS? Transportation is a huge problem for college students because getting a car or other modes of transport takes a huge initial investment of money and space. Our habit of calling short Uber rides is unhealthy for the environment as well as our wallets. Velo aims to change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Velo, bike owners can easily rent out their bikes for an hourly rate. Bike seekers can look at all the available bikes on their campus and rent one out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Ruby on Rails framework, an SQLite database to store the data from all the bikes in rotation, as well as some HTML/CSS and VanillaJS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For all of us, this was our first time using Ruby on Rails or setting up a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully set up the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of good practices for using Ruby on Rails!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Velo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add other modes of transportation, including scooters, skateboards, rollerblades, etc. We also need to add a way to make payments within the website.
