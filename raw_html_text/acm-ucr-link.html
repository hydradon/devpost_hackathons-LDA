                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many orgs at UCR use links in their slides that are not easily copied or noted down. Our hope is that through acmucr.link, at least the ACM@UCR chapter will have user-friendly links.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end allows for a user to add short links and map them to long links. He/she can also add multiple links in one go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by building the server to handle getting a mapping between a short/long url. Then we build a way to add a new mapping.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Concurrently, we were building the React front-end, which allows a user to make new links, and "hosts" the short links.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first experience with web development for 3/4 of the team, and we learned a lot!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ACM@UCR Link
                </h2>
                <p>
                    acmucr.link is going to be used by the ACM@UCR chapter starting Monday at our next general meeting! We also have plans to abstract the interface out to the rest of the Bourns College of Engineering (bcoe.link, eventually), allowing other orgs to do the same with their linking functionality.
