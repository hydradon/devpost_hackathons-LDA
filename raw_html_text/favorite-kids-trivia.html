                    My biggest challenge was to find the right content or theme for my skill, because, at least in my opinion, the Content Is Everything. I didn&rsquo;t want to create a skill that only a few computer nerds could appreciate. 
First, I went to the library and asked the librarian what are the most popular books that kids under 13.
                    <br>
                    Second, I interviewed a number of kids under 13, asking what their most favorite book is. 
Third, I checked on Amazon.com for the most popular books is for kids under 13.
                    <br>
                    Everything was pointing to the same book &ndash; The Diary of a Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney.
Forth, I checked the SEO keyword search report and learned that there are over 10 million monthly searches for the keywords &ldquo;Diaries of the Wimpy Kid&rdquo;.
                    <br>
                    Finally, I checked if somebody already created a similar skill, because I wanted to avoid duplication.
The book &ldquo;Diaries of the Wimpy Kid&rdquo; was clearly the winner.
Then, I got to work. I found the most favorite moments in the book and wrote questions about them. The correct answer I got from the book, but the incorrect answers I wrote myself and I knew that they had to be in the same humorous style and as entertaining as the book itself. That took a lot of Internet research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used Amazon Alexa Trivia template as a basis for the skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I &ldquo;tested&rdquo; my trivia content on my friends and got their feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I created this Wimpy Kid Trivia skill and I created another trivia skill base on the book Dork Diaries.
Goals for the future? To created many funny and entertaining trivia skills for kids.
