                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In big buildings like the Tech-Base the delivery-man often has to wait a long time for people picking up their parcels.
And if nobody has time at the moment the delivery-man arrives, he takes the parcel with him again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why not leave the parcels at an indoor parcel station and send an message to the receiver?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an interface for the delivery-man where he can tell that he left a parcel. Also at the same interface the receivers can pick up their parcels by inserting their personal token. 
The receiver gets notified with an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The delivery/pick-up interface was built with Angular. The backend with NodeJS, TypeScript and MongoDB.
The app was implemented with Flutter.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To deal with the new tools and the new scripting languages etc.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked together as a team and so we gained a lot of knowledge about Typescript, HTML, CSS/SASS and Flutter.
The most of us had to learn all these things in the first place.
