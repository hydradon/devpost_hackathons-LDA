                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that only a certain few news stories grab the attention of the general population. Natural disasters are only one example of those stories that go unheard. With temperatures on the rise and a rapidly changing climate, we should be paying more attention to natural disasters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JJETrelief focuses on underrepresented communities affected by natural disasters all over the world. The website updates the status of these communities in real-time and gives you the option to donate money if you wish. You may also customize what you wish to see based on the date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off learning the basics: setting up the repository, learning the basic commands/syntax of different languages, navigating the documentation of those languages, and having a long brainstorming session. Once we had our idea, we put together a site map and component map to help guide us through the project. Joyce and Jody focused on the front-end portion, while Tania and Elaine worked on the back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first time doing a hackathon for most of our team. It was also most of our first time using Github and the command prompt.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We improved our coding skills, and got a taste of Bootstrap and SQLite. Though many of us had difficulties with the programming aspect, we all found our own way to contribute to the final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Github and how to set up a virtual environment. We went through the process of creating a dynamic website. Under the time pressure, we learned to efficiently collaborate with each other and make use of each individual's strengths.
                </p>

                    All of us are looking forwards to participating in future hackathons!
