                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My cats have been eating my plants, even the spiky ones. I was super excited to get a new succulent here at Technica, and I wanted to find a way to protect it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a robot that spins (plastic) knives when a button is pressed in order to protect the small plant that fits in a special container in the back of the chassis.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used various pieces of hardware supplied by MLH, in addition to an ArduinoUno which we programmed using the Arduino web editor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unfamiliar with the coding language, the knife kept popping off (luckily nobody was hurt), the original DC motor used was unable to rotate, the ultrasonic senors kept malfunctioning which led us to switch to a button, the many wires used kept coming unplugged from the breadboard, it was difficult to attach the knife, we had to produce the chassis without knowing the exact dimensions of the plant that it was going to hold, and the char variable kept causing errors, we had to switch to a servo from a DC motor, and we had to use a resistor because the excess voltage kept causing interference.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we finished, the servo is functioning, nobody got hurt, and it was fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned some C++, we used our chutzpah to try new and ambitious and demo it.
                </p>

                    What's next for Edward Knifey Robot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the original Edward Knifey Robot's hardware is returned to MLH, a new generation of EKRs will continue to protect Emma's new succulent courageously.
