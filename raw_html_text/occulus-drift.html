                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever woke up in the morning, and wanted to be Superman? But also slightly tipsy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Leap Motion and Occulus Rift along with the latest and greatest innovations in procedurally generated 3D drunk flying technology, we bring the projectile vomiting and vertigo of drunk flying to the comfort of your living room!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hills, staying awake and not vomiting during testing. These were fixed with practice, tesco's finest energy drinks along with long walks and constant naps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Procedurally generated islands allowing unlimited simulation of drunk superman physics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Superman has a very, very, very strong stomach. It's like it's made of steel.
                </p>

                    What's next for Occulus Drift
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lying down in a darkened room that doesn't move in any way shape or form.
