                <p>
                    As victims, bystanders and perpetrators of cyberbullying, we felt it was necessary to focus our efforts this weekend on combating an issue that impacts 1 in 5 Canadian teens. As technology continues to advance, children are being exposed to vulgarities online at a much younger age than before.

                    searches through any webpage a child may access, censors black-listed words and replaces them with an appropriate emoji. This easy to install chrome extension is accessible for all institutional settings or even applicable home devices.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a Google chrome extension using JavaScript (JQuery), HTML, and CSS. We also used regular expressions to detect and replace profanities on webpages. The UI was developed with Sketch.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Every member of our team was a first-time hacker, with little web development experience. We learned how to use JavaScript and Sketch on the fly. We&rsquo;re incredibly grateful for the mentors who supported us and guided us while we developed these new skills (shout out to Kush from Hootsuite)!

                    Expand the size of our black-list.
Increase robustness so it parses pop-up messages as well, such as live-stream comments.
