                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyday I left my dorm around 8:30 for my 8:40, I'd just know I was late. I'd wait to check the bus schedules to see how fast I'd have to run in order to catch the next bus. But it was a real hassle to open the app, let the data load, and check the routes and stops. It seemed more complicated than it should be, despite its attempt at making it easier for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted at building an iOS and Android application which allows a user to log in and access their personal course schedules. With these course schedules, the app would know when the user's class is, where it takes place, and based on where the user currently is, a route which took into account the time needed to get to the nearest bus stop, catch the next bus, and be able make it to class right on time. Also, as a convenience feature, we built widgets on iOS and a notification system for Android which displays the nearest bus stop and it's routes right for easy access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used XCode to build the iOS widget, Android-Studio for the App, and Windows Azure for data management services. We used Yale and Rutger's buses and courses API in order to retrieve content for our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with both the Yale Developer API and Windows Azure in our development of this hack. As first time users, it took longer than it should have to set up simple tasks such as user log in, and database access through the application.
We also ran into the problem of getting the course schedules to load. This especially pushed back our plans for the app as we weren't able to create the system of course prediction that we were looking to.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our achievements this weekend in learning how to develop apps for both the iOS and Android platform and being able to set up a mobile service backend.
