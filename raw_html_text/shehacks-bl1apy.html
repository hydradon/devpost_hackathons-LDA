                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SwipeRight is the perfect solution for banks to engage millennials early. With almost 80% of millennials claiming to have their mobile phone with them at all times. Many say (ourselves included) that they are more likely to open a new bank account with their phone versus in person and so, we wanted to create a digital solution for them to manage their money in a smart and easy manner. Further, the majority of the millennial population face massive student loans and are making conscious lifestyle changes in order to save.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By rewarding users with Scene points for staying within budget or inviting friends to the application, we can add a gamification component to managing finances. Seeing as how users who manage their budgets effectively each month will be rewarded with Scene points, we wanted to also explore how this application would benefit companies partnered with Scene. Cineplex affiliated restaurants and companies can personally target users based on their spending habits to advertise how Scene points should be spent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a few months, when the user saves enough money, the bank is able to suggest ways in which the customer can invest their money with them, or when they become ready to use other bank products and services such as wealth management. By the end of this interaction, the bank will have obtained a lifelong customer.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end was built on HTML and jquery. We then used stdLib to connect the python analytics to node.js and then to the front end.
                </p>

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team consisted of members from diverse and varying disciplines; we ranged from medicine to math, engineering, and design. Due to the fact that we were each so specialized in our own distinctive fields, we had to figure out the best ways to weave our skills together to create the most holistic solution. In the end, we were able to offer our own unique contribution to the product while simultaneously dynamically learning from one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Next steps for SwipeRight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SwipeRight currently functions as a budget generator that rewards users with Scene points. Although it exists as a platform for the bank to collect lifelong millennial users, in the future we see it as a scaffold for learning. Our next goals for SwipeRight are educational in nature; we want SwipeRight to be able to both suggest ways for the customer to invest their money and also to teach users how and why to invest.
