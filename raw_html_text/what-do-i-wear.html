                    We built this using a deep learning model implemented in Tensorflow along with some machine learning in Python.

                <p>
                    Collecting the data was a big challenges we ran into and this took up a lot of time.
We are proud to have completed such a ambitious project in the limited time of the hackathon. We learned to run a complete machine learning pipeline from data collection to final test results. We would like to improve on this project by adding accessories for both men and women. We would also like to suggest new clothes you can add to your wardrobe in your budget.
