                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all feel the need to donate, but don't always have the time or opportunity to do so. We thought we could solve the problem by letting a very minute part of one's daily purchases get a meal for a person in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We allow the user to set goals (per week, bi-week, month) that reflect the amount he/she wants to donate. We then try to round his/her purchases to round figures (under considerable limits) and contribute the money collected at the end of the day to an organization/NGO in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python-Flask to implement the backend of the system. Firebase was used as a database. The frontend was covered by Foundation. All of these revolved around the use of Capital One Nessie APIs to access account detail, get merchants, make transfers and purchases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us are new to web development, so this was our very first project handling full-stack, working with REST APIs, and integrating databases. We also had a hard time testing our datasets since we had a limited set of user accounts on Nessie.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ended up having a user friendly front-end, and a reliable backend. The data reacts freely with Python-Flask and we have a good set of tests to display our work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything to do with web apps.

                    What's next for PennySum
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If a little more flexibility is given with the APIs, we could categorize merchants and only deduct amounts from purchases made in a restaurant, notify users of deductions, and have a friendly leader-board to promote charity.
