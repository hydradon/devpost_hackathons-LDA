                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an employer, it's really costly to hire people, up to $5000 for one person. Recruiting companies also have lots of tedious and time-consuming administrative tasks. Even after we select an applicant, employees may sometimes back out of the deal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an employee, it's really hard to find the right fit for a job. As a student, it is very difficult and time-consuming to fill out endless applications for jobs, only to secure a job that is often not the right match. Even after the acceptance offer, there are still lengthy background checks that must be completed.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Smart Recruiting offers benefits to both employers and employees by connecting them directly to each other and eliminating the middleman, the recruiting agency. Smart Recruiting will simplify the tedious administrative work throughout the entire recruitment process by leveraging blockchain technologies. Employees will be able to refer friends and families to jobs that best fit their unique skillsets.

                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To Build the Business Model, we researched costs, competitors, and the current blockchain environment to see what would best fit our solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran In to
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The blockchain does not have many precedents as it is a very new landscape. Information was difficult to find or estimate at times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was exciting to achieve so much during our first hackathon, including developing a practical business model, mockups, and learning about the technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the cost structures and revenue streams of token models, the risks involved, the market strategy to bring the community together and what makes blockchain communities successful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smart Recruiting
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we hope to implement Smart Recruiting in real life, once the blockchain technology is mature enough. If it is implemented successfully, we hope to expand our idea to use AI algorithms to match employers and employees to the perfect job fit.
