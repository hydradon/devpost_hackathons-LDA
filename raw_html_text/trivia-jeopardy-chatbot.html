                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to utilize the Cisco Webex teams software and Botkit API. A Chatbot was something new to all of us and was far different from any of the class projects we have ever gotten.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ChatBot can be deployed into a conversation. Then, multiple users can interact with the ChatBot in real-time. A user can start a new trivia game; this triggers the ChatBot to start asking questions to all of the users playing the game at the same time. The user then sends in input, which the ChatBot uses to determine and update scores of the current players accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a Webex Bot App and used a botkit starter template(deployed on Glitch.com) to connect to the Webex Bot via the access token and studio API token. Therefore, any changes made to the code in Glitch will automatically be reflected in the bot's behavior.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inexperience with Javascript and resulting errors and lack of syntactical knowledge (callback functions, dynamically typed variables, asynchronous functions, etc). Using Javascript required a vastly different mindset compared to using object oriented programming languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are prideful of new understanding of Cisco Webex Teams and Botkit API, and how they relate towards each other. 
We are also proud of the fact that we have some exposure and experience with Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned how to create and implement a ChatBot into a conversation. We also were able to know how to link multiple software together for multiple processes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trivia/Jeopardy ChatBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future ChatBot is implementing other games to entertain users.
