                    Doodle Sounds: A Tool to Sonify your Drawings

                    What it is
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This drawing applet allows its user to doodle with four different colors, each corresponding to a different instrument. Once the user has completed a drawing, a play button is clicked and the score is played back. The directionality of the line or shape drawn triggers the pitch to increase or decrease. The drawing can be cleared to start a new piece.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java to run an applet. We created a recording class to save the recording data as a hashmap of timestamps and speeds/locations. We saved each musical note as a discreet audio file and played them back in the recording class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we wanted to create a website to make the app more accessible, however we did not have the knowledge to host it. We ran into some aesthetic challenges, such as the difficulty of creating a visually pleasing interface because we did not use a scripting language. The main challenge was getting the audio to play in the applet and having it play at the speed we hoped. Additionally, we did not have enough time to implement the ability to play the various recordings concurrently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to finally get the sound to function despite it not working as smoothly as we would like. We also are proud of our teamwork in a team of two with only one experienced in computer science!
