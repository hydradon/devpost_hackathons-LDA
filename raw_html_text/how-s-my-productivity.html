                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have wondered for a while where my time has gone. When i have been aimlessly wondering the internet during study breaks. Even some times during my research itself.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracks different domains that you visit.  (I.E. reddit.com basically just the main site not individual pages.) Every time that you switch tabs in google it logs the domain and takes the start time of when you access the tab.  When you switch tabs again it logs that time and subtracts it from the first time and saves the time in seconds that you remained on the page.  Correlating all the domains and times spent into a MSSQL database then through MicroStrategy's API so that you can get visualizations of where you have spent your time.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being that it is a chrome extension the backbone are JavaScript calls pulling information from the websites that you visit. A Python 3 script collects the data and dumps the data into a MSSQL database and finaly with all data gathered i use MicroStrategy's analytics API to preform operations on the data so that it can be viewed easily

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Little to no knowledge of JavaScript.  How the language stored data to where how to get data from the program into a form that i could run analytics on it.  Finding the right JavaScript APIs so that i wouldn't have redundancy. How to populate a MSSQL database with a python script.
