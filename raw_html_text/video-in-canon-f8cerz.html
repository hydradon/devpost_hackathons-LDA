                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A now defunct site a friend once showed me
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The page takes a video ID from the user for a Youtube video. Then, several Youtube players are displayed, filling the page, and presenting the video with itself. However, each player is slightly delayed from the previous one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apache hosts the page. Javascript to interact with the Youtube iframe player API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking advantage of Javascript's asynchronous features
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That what I have (approximately) does what I intended
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got more familiar with Javascript, and gleaned a little knowledge of Apache
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Video in Canon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To properly take a single video stream from Youtube instead of opening several at once. It's a more elegant solution.
