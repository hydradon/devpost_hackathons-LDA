                <p>
                    In general, people are
                    <strong>
                        statistically insignificant
                    </strong>
                    . Billions of lives are nothing but
                    <strong>
                        empty puppets
                    </strong>
                    , buffeted by the torrential winds of chaos as major events are generated by the decisions of mother nature and the powerful few. As the years pass, the struggle to maintain the delusion of control becomes both exhausting and, after some soul-seeking, decidedly pointless. You spend an hour too long
                    <strong>
                        wallowing in psychophilosophical self-pity
                    </strong>
                    and now you're late for work.
