                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to build AvatarRESCUE for a number of reasons. Our strongest reason to developing this application is to mitigate human lost in disaster relief scenarios and emergency medical interventions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have seen natural disasters worsening every year by creating greater damage to communities and more harm to human lives. This frequency of recorded natural disasters has increased nearly five-fold in the last 50 years. Recent events that have inspired this effort have been, but not limited to, the California Fires of 2018, such as the Woolsey Fire (LA) and Camp Fire (NorCal). For scope and context, The Camp Fire burned 153,336 acres of land and destroyed 18,804 structures with most of the damage occurring within the first four hours. In April 2015, Nepal was experience a 8.1 magnitude earthquake which killed nearly 9,000 people and injured nearly 22,000 more. It is these events and stories that inspired our work with AvatarRESCUE.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    AvatarRESCUE Mobile App integrates 5G Networks, IBM Watson, and Magic Leap to train non-medical persons and assist medical professional to administer intervention in Disaster Relief Scenarios in Remote and Realtime&hellip; Increase the probability of success within the golden hour. &ldquo;&hellip;realtime, remote, relief&hellip;&rdquo;

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, our team created a chatbot interface leveraging IBM Watson&rsquo;s Speech-to-text, Assistant, and text-to-speech integration via API calls with Unity. Second, we integrated our chatbot into a 3D Environment - leveraging Magic Leap as the interface  unit - to simulate and train 2 rescue scenarios and 3 applications in CPR, fracture stabilization, bleeding out and applying tourniquet for both non-medical/medical persons to administer intervention.

                <p>
                    We ran into a number of challenges. Here are some from the team.

                <p>
                    Jay
Keeping time and prioritizing what our team should be focusing on within the 48 hours given to build a MVP.

                    Ksenia
Setting up entities vs intents when using IBM Watson Assistant, that was blocking the chatbot responses. Second, when setting up nodes, there was a challenge going deep into several levels of child nodes.

                    John
Getting models and informational panels to spatially locate in reference to a patient body reliably. Achieving interaction between android chatbot and magic leap without relying on networking stack, due to time constraints.

                <p>
                    Joe
A challenge I faced was integrating the IBM Watson API into Unity3D. As IBM is currently undergoing updates, the documentation is varied and conflicting depending on when it was written.

                    Ksenia
&ndash; It is easier to get intents working, however, as I have more time, I would like to work more with entities.
&ndash; Building visuals for Magic Leap.

&ndash; How to get magic leap image tracking api to function as a boolean trigger for placing objects in reference to spatially located points, rather than directly located on the tracked image itself. Learned a fast trick for making a controller object manipulation script.
&ndash; For future, reference learned a high level explainer of magic leap persistent coordinate frames which enable shared anchor points between multiple devices&rsquo; maps.
