                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This projects helps and guides visually impaired individuals to write numbers by tracing along.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. We also implemented a few text to speech modules.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although both of us had a little experience in web development. None of us had made anything similar to this before, hence we had to learn a few technologies and implement them simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing a working prototype within our 36-hr hackathon time-frame
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More than gaining technical knowledge we learnt how to effectively manage time, ask help, manage project such that the project is developed in an organized and productive way between you and your team-mate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blindfold
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our time when we were developing blindfold we had several ideas which could potentially make the project easier to use for people and also be more effective in its purpose but we could not implement those ideas as we did not have enough time or knowledge but later on we are planning on spending some more time to develop this prototype into a fully functioning project.
