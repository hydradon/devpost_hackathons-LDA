                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team member and I run into the problem of "where we should eat" almost every single time we go out to eat. Because we are very indecisive, it often takes us a long time to choose which restaurant we should go to. We created this application in order to save the time and agony of deciding where to go and letting the app choose for us. We hope this app will help save the time of other UNC students as well!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Android app randomly selects a restaurant on and surrounding Franklin Street that is within walking distance of UNC. It displays the randomly chosen restaurant name and the location of the restaurant on a map (powered by Google Maps).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because my team member and I have never used Android Studio before, we spent the majority of the day reading documentation and getting used to the different aspects and features of Android Studio. Other specific problems we ran into were getting the map to show up and correcting the zoom on the map and allowing text box expansion so the text does not get cut off on the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are both proud that we were able to learn how to use Android Studio and create an app in a day!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is possible to learn how to use a new IDE and create an app in a short amount of time if both members put the effort into it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Where to Eat on Franklin Street
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add features that allow the user to input their budget, whether they are vegetarian/vegan, seperate the restaurants based on the cuisine that offer, and create a more streamlined design among other features.
