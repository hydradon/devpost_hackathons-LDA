                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for Bluetooth LED came from wanting to find a simpler way to communicate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a photoresistor is touched on one Arduino board, an LED lights up on the other, letting the owner of the second board know that the first board's owner is present and there to communicate if needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used two Arduino Uno boards, and one breadboard as our main project platform. On one board, we have a Bluetooth master module and a photoresistor. The master module transmits the information from the photoresistor when it is touched to the slave Bluetooth module on the second board. Once the slave module receives the information, an LED on the same board lights up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was in respect to hardware; figuring out how to convert one of the Bluetooth modules into a master module, then attempting to connect both modules. At one point throughout the project, we had a very hard time attempting to set the serial monitors to the proper baud rate for the modules. Another challenge would be writing the code for the slave module's serial monitor in order to have an LED light up once the photoresistor on the other Arduino was touched.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of ourselves for taking on such an ambitious project seeing as all of us had very limited experience with Arduino and hardware in general. We were able to achieve a well-working project with only our drive and self-motivation to learn new concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to keep working on something despite feeling as though we would never finish or have a project working to our satisfaction. We also learned various amounts of information in relation to hardware, such as how to wire an Arduino and incorporate Bluetooth modules onto a board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bluetooth LED
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to elevate our project by possibly incorporating an Android app to control the LED light instead of a photoresistor, including several more LEDs or even an LCD monitor to convey a message whenever the photoresistor is touched.
