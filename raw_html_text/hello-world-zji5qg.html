                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hello World was an app inspired by the idea of understanding the world around us more efficiently. Based off of the Pok&eacute;dex idea, Hello World tries to emulate the feel of a simple but useful everyday app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can take photos of their content of interest, and that information will be recognized with Wolfram technologies in image and text recognition. Using wikipedia API, a short summary of the content will be returned so that users can learn more about the content, with the option to further explore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react to emulate a mobile app. Wolfram solved a lot of our problems since we could make APIs ourselves and also return incredibly detailed text corresponding to a single image because of their image identification language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first time any of us really used react, so setting it up took a long time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we actually got it working!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wolfram is amazing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hello World
                </h2>
                <p>
                    hopefully connection to social media can be established, and machine learning can be implemented so that there is a possibility of predictive image identification that caters towards each person (so someone who likes flowers can get more accurate returns of flower types)
