                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that most of the time contracts are based on the trust between the two parties, can be a huge problem in our daily lifes and even in the businesslife. Therefore we are using Smart Contracts that are deployed on the Ethereumblockchain, which asure through the decentralized Blockchaineconomy that this third party can be omitted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The App provides different Categories and Templates for different contracts. The user can choose one of these and can customize them the way he prefers to. It is even possible to upload a picture of the ID onto the blockchain to be on the safe site if one of the contract guidelines are not waterproof (help of lawyers will be used to make them waterproof in the future)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was built on the Ethereum Blockchain and the materialize framework was used for the frontenddesign.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a Testnet based on the Ethereum Blockchain is very difficult since the whole technology is very young and therefore there isn't a bulletproof tutorial to create it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a Smart Contract on the blockchain worked after hours of work and seeing incoming transactions on the Contract and recognizing the huge possibility of the technology made us proud that we dared making this step to this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very lucky to have met someone on the event that gave us the contact for someone who has already worked with the Ethereum Blockchain and even Smart Contracts. Without the one hour Skype-Call during the Hackathon, we wouldn't have been able to finish this very complicated project. That is why we have learned that networking on such events like hackathons is also a very important part and must not be missed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smart Contracts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more and more Templates and Guidelines for Contracts to the app.
Our Vision is a world where there isn't any case anymore where trust is a must to create any contract. Whichever contract it would be.
Since the research of Blockchain Technology and especially Smart Contracts we can be sure that problems will be able to be solved, that we can't event think of right now.
We are incredible excited.
