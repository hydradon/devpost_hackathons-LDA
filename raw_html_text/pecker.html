                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of people who need access to contraceptives, and there's a surplus of #4 and #5 plastics that cant be re-used. This is a solution that addresses both.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses recycled
                    <strong>
                        number 4 plastics
                    </strong>
                    to make polyethylene condoms, which are stronger, and thinner than latex condoms. These condoms are hypoallergenic because they are not made of latex. The packaging is also made of recycled
                    <strong>
                        number 5 plastic
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used various household objects to heat and mold the plastic over our 3D printed condom mold.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overmelting the plastic and losing it's flexibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having made an MVP from plastic materials we found in our workspace and using materials we had in our homes to create it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the world's sex habits, condom usage, and a lot about the problems people in other communities face, and the organizations that help these communities. We also learned a lot about recycling and the materials that are difficult to recycle.

                    What's next for PECker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to branch out to making other sexual health products such as dental wrap. Dental wrap helps prevent the spread of disease through oral sex.
