                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GroupMe isn't like the worst chat app ever made, but it's pretty close. Read receipts don't sync, sometimes the official clients forget certain chats exist (especially direct messages!), and there's so many inconsistencies and bugs between the different official clients. Oh, and how many times have users asked for a search function?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm sick of it. I'm sick of everybody on campus using GroupMe instead of something like Slack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if everybody used Slack?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What if they did without even knowing it?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SlackMe is a disgusting amalgamation of GroupMe's and Slack's APIs that allows me to see GroupMe messages inside Slack. Slack's superior message management and search ability, combined with SlackMe, will hopefully make for a better GroupMe experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After all, it's not like they set the bar very high.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started by experimenting with
                    <a href="https://dev.groupme.com/tutorials/push" rel="nofollow">
                        GroupMe's push tutorial
                    </a>
                    inside of
                    <a href="https://insomnia.rest/" rel="nofollow">
                        Insomnia
                    </a>
                    , my preferred web requests client. I began with HTTP long polling, then moved on to connecting to GroupMe's Faye instance over WebSockets. To test out working with their WebSockets API I used
                    <a href="http://www.websocket.org/echo.html" rel="nofollow">
                        websocket.org's Echo Test
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there I tried to smush that into Node.js. I chose Node because it's something I've always wanted to learn, and this was a pretty decent excuse to learn it. Additionally I was thinking of deploying SlackMe on Zeit's
                    <a href="https://zeit.co/now" rel="nofollow">
                        now
                    </a>
                    , which [used to] prefer Node. After mucking about with Axios and ws, I had a basic read-only client that let me see different GroupMe events such as incoming messages, new logins, and likes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next I had to get that into Slack somehow, since that was the whole point of SlackMe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slack has an incoming webhooks function, but I soon discovered that it would be tedious to maintain different webhooks for different channels. So I mucked about with their REST API and was eventually able to get text and pictures sent to GroupMe sent in Slack as well.
