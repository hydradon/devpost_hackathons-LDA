                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a huge coffee fans, we really like the idea of Paulig Muki. However, the application for the cup was really underdeveloped and did not provide proper UX. Therefore we decided to do research and implement neccessary features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a significant iprovement of the current UI on a theoretical basis. We believe that introducing new features, when UI prevents its adoption, is a waste of time, so that we have implemented our own vision of how the redesigned application should look like. It provides extra functionality based on simple built-in features in order to increase user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, our project will solve current UI problems and open a way for iplementing new technologies. Qualitive development should not be managed before the introduction of solid and usable basis.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prototypes were build according to the users feedback on Play Market and our own research. We kindly interviewed 20 people in order to find out problems in application. The android studio was user for application development, but we did not manage to acomplish it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges was time management, which was hard due to the fact that the environment in which original Muki application had been built is unfamiliar for us.

                <p>
                    Development of the product, so that it matches UI prototypes designed after the research. Additionally, we propose some hardwar modifications that we would like to apply in the future.
