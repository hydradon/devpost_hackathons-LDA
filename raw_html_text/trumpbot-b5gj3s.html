                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to make AI great again. To do this we decided to use the inspirational wisdom of the presidential candidate Donald j. Trump.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to communicate wit either text or an image (using Clarifai's api) and respond back. It uses Facebook's messenger platform to communicate with

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a website to show our project with links and video using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Jquery while the chatbot/AI was built using node.js and clarifai's image and video recognition api on the Facebook messenger platform.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of difficulty with an api called api text razor which ultimately failed and we then switched to clarifai's api platform.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This entire project which consisted of a 2,000 + line website, a chatbot with photo/video recognition, and a marketing video in 12 hours is probably one of my greatest projects, not to mention the humorous topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding is hard work and advice from others is recommended.

                    What's next for TrumpBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will work to make the recognition library bigger and with different people maybe.
