                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that there is no easy way to connect guests a Disney parks with park resources, emergency alerts, and more. This is why we decided to make an app that does this all for you
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a mobile app that features attractions at your current park.
It has 3 different interfaces for users:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        For Guests at Disney parks
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An interface for seeing attractions and wait times for attractions (which are most popular etc)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An interface for live updates
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Receives emergency notifications if an emergency event takes place in the user's given area
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For Park faculty
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They can report suspicious guests, baggages, and threats to administrators. Recieve instructions on how to respond from park administrators
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For park administrators
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Receive updates of threats from park employees. Sends notifications to park guests on what to do / how to respond in emergency situations 
The three types of users work together to help make the park a safer, more fun, and more efficient experience. 
## How we built it
We used Swift and Xcode to build the iOS app. Plans to expand to Android.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had alot of challenges getting the data from Disney parks, We eventually gave up since we would have to manually input all the data -- we are using fake location data for now -- with the hope that disney could give us more data. We also learned how to make different user interfaces for different types of users. The server was also a big challenge -- sending targeted push notications through the server.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a sick logo :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned alot of Xcode and swift throughout the process. Learned how to use push notifications, tableviews and more
                </p>
