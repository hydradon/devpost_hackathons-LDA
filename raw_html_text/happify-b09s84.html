                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I was a child, I went through a lot of bullying and found looking at some very depressing websites on the internet that had graphic and grotesque images on them. Looking back on it, I wouldn't want any other child to go through the same experience I did. To solve this problem, I created Happify.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Happify is a chrome extension that analyzes the images you see on your screen and replaces the sad ones with an image of a happy cat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Happify scrapes all the images from the html of a page and computes a sentimental score between 0 and 1 for each using a combination of a dictionary api, an image tag api, and a sentimental analysis api. If the computed score is less than epsilon (0.10), then we replace that image reference with one on the internet of a happy cat.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looking for APIs to use was pretty darn hard. There weren't very many APIs I could use at HTN. Also some minor JavaScript timing issues.

                    Building our sentimental analysis algorithm from scratch instead of relying on external APIs.
