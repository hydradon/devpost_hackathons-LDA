                    A web application based on the idea of Airbnb, where users can rent out space in their driveway or parking garage to people looking for a place to park their car. 
In many large cities such as San Francisco or Los Angeles, parking spots are hard to find and can be quite expensive. However, there is a plethora of untapped parking estate in commuters, private garages, and apartment complexes which the occasional vacationer or frequent commuter could offer to vehicles from mopeds to large SUVs. Large surges in parking activity during concerts, games, and other large venues is where People's Parking shines; peak surges w/more demand for spaces raise in-app prices, incentivizing more people to open up parking, allowing venue-goers more much sought-after parking and parking providers more monetary gain for their service. People's Parking is a

                    , unlike other

                    Our service aims to assign each user of the service a unique ID, put on display when either utilizing or offering parking. Proper government identification is registered securely with each account to establish the trust associated with providing a long-term relationship. With a better ui and a more specialized market focus than auction sites and guaranteed publicity and occupancy for preexisting corporate parking garages, it fills a niche unlike any other in its current market. The intended implementation features a heatmap of registered spaces, distance tracking and suggestions, as well as a thorough schedule and availability pricing.

                    We ran into time constraints due to the nature of the hackathon and working with entirely new APIs and unfamiliar languages, but our live site contains many of the core ideas of the People's Parking service.
