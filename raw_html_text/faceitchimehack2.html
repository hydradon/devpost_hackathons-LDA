                    Rape happens. But the universal response to this on campus is to sweep it under the rug with victim blaming, protecting the reputations of the assailants and universities and treating survivors like a &ldquo;public relations management problem&rdquo;. Our goal is to shine a light on this issue by providing a safe, comfortable tool for survivors to tell their story and seek help in a way that best suits them. Survivors can anonymously give a truthful account of their experience with as much or as little detail as they like. All without the fear, pressure or intimidation of filing a formal claim. Survivors can also look to other experiences, discussions and resources to find peace of mind and make an informed decision about their next step.
