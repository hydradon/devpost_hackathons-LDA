                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from learning to deal with the immense workload and stress that come from studying engineering. Unfortunately most of the resources available ruin the immersive experience of Virtual Reality. We want to change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project utilizes the Oculus Rift and Leap to create a meditative experience like no other. We've tried other apps on mobile and VR, but both platforms alone provide a very limited experience that makes it much more difficult for the user to relax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity, we were able to make each of the devices work together, the scripting was done in C#. Some models were made in Blender, while others came from Unity store. All of the assets we utilized from the store, however, were free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We wanted to incorporate the Muse and Pebble Time into our setup but the link to the SDK is no longer supported in Unity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We encountered many broken links and poor documentation for the hardware.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only did we make an awesome application using the Leap Motion, Myo, and Oculus but we also contributed some much-needed innovation in the market for meditation applications. More than anything we are most proud of working for the first time, on all of these devices and making something cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with unfamiliar hardware is equally daunting and rewarding. It was incredibly difficult to get everything working correctly, but it was one of the most rewarding experiences we've had yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for sereni.tech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue to develop our project in our free time. Unfortunately, none of us own an Oculus so we will need to seek funds from our university in order to continue development or pool our money together to purchase one.
