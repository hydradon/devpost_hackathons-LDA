                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New ways to learn is something we could always use, and VR is a good way as it gives you a new environment as well as helps you learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides different scenarios with objects in them, which you can click on to get its terminology in English and Spanish. It also quizzes you on what you had learnt before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of us designed the rooms using the Asset Store and arranged it based on what we needed. The other two of us used C# and Unity to write the scripts to be able to select the objects and give different outputs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of us did not have prior experience in Unity, the app started glitching different on the HMD than on the computer, but we managed to fix the bug.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we actually got three scenes with transitions in less than 24 hours and learnt so much.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Start small, and then keep building when it's a small Hackathon. A lot of our ideas had to be scrapped back due to timing.
                </p>

                    What's next for Talk Espanol To Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing the bugs, and then making it a full-fledged app with other words/scenarios.
