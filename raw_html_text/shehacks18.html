                    Are you tired of hearing people citing inaccurate and extremely biased sources? Now you can accurately call someone out for their Fake News with our bias detector. Simply input a website address and then we will scrape the article and tell you how it leans. If it is in the middle it is considered to be a valid source, but if it leans too far left or right it will be labeled as extreme and a biased news source.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you can check the bias of your family, random strangers on the internet, and even your own news.
