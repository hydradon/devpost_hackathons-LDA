                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking to combine multiple SDKs &amp; APIs to have a feeling of the beginning of a large scale project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a robust gesture controller that handles media control and lighting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We banged our head against the keyboard and eventually produced good Python code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing dependency issues was our main concern. We found this to be expected especially when working with new SDKs and APIs. We also struggled with fixing our Leap Motion controller to handle one vs more than one finger circles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting all the dependencies working correctly really shouldn't be something we're proud of, but since it was such a pain, we are. Also the fact that we have implemented both the Leap Motion controller and the LIFX bulb together to produce a working product is something we're proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We confirmed integration is still the most difficult thing. We also learned to start small and then scale up. Also with minimal Python background using a new language was an engaging experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for KSU Hack 2016 - Gesture Media Controls
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to fix current implementations of fast-forward and reverse, then we can follow up with adding more features including but not limited to: chapter skips/seeking, multiple platform integration, and mood lights for music.
