                    I wanted to make this because I thought about the theme and a recent fact i had heard. I researched it and it was true and started designing my project. It is intended to keep students on task and help them not get distracted while studying. I made the design using Sketch. I am not a good coder so i only made a design. I am proud of the aesthetic aspect of my work. I learned that app design is not easy as everything is based on the other and it can't be complex. Next I would hope to be able to have the help of someone to make this idea reality and also to implement a task manager that students who want to up their game can lock themselves for the time this app only not allowing them to get off task other than breaks.
