                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Plaid's challenge to "help people make more sense of their financial lives." We wanted to create a way for people to easily view where they are spending their money so that they can better understand how to conserve it. Plaid's API allows us to see financial transactions, and Google Maps API serves as a great medium to display the flow of money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GeoCash starts by prompting the user to login through the Plaid API. Once the user is authorized, we are able to send requests for transactions, given the public_token of the user. We then displayed the locations of these transactions on the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using JavaScript, including Meteor, React, and Express frameworks. We also utilized the Plaid API for the transaction data and the Google Maps API to display the data.
                </p>

                    Data extraction/responses from Plaid API, InfoWindow displays in Google Maps

                <p>
                    Successfully implemented meteor webapp, integrated two different APIs into our product
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meteor (Node.js and React.js), Plaid API, Google Maps API, Express framework
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GeoCash
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on integrating real user information into our webapp; we currently only using the sandbox user, which has a very limited scope of transactions. We would like to implement differently size displays on the Maps API to represent the amount of money spent at the location. We would like to display different color displays based on the time of day, which was not included in the sandbox user. We would also like to implement multiple different user displays at the same time, so that we can better describe the market based on the different categories of transactions.
