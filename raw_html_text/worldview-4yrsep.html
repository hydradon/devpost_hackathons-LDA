                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the AstraZeneca challenge, we chose the words Mobile, Gamification, and Recycling. Mobile phones are now universal, and provide an easy way for people to track their actions on the go. We used gamification
to encourage employees to recycle and subsequently track their recycling, by presenting an instant visualisation of their impact through a virtual city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Employees use the 'My Impact' page to see their current scores and to log entries for paper, food, and other recycling. We ask them to reflect on the items they have recycled, and on how much more they could have recycled, and use these to change a score. This score determines the growth of different areas of the city. Paper recycling grows the trees, Food grows crops, Other destroys factories, and your overall total builds skyscrapers. Previous logs can be scrolled though in the My Journey page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one of us had Unity experience, but we split up the different parts of the app and developed these in Unity individually, before coming together at the end to combine all the pieces.
