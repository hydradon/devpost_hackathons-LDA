                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Games are fun, gaming with friends is even more fun, bring those games as close to real life as possible is the best and that's want we wanted to achieve when we set out to create Snap Survival.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snap Survival is a Battle Royale Game where you and your friends are required to attempt to eliminate each other by stealthily capturing pictures of their faces all while the playing field shrinks to a closer and closer center point. Last person standing is the champion!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A 2 step facial integration/identification process is the beating heart of the project, and this interfaces with our web server to allow players to upload their "shots" or pictures in an attempt to oust the competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With such a wide variety of libraries, platforms, and compute resources (Phones, Servers, Desktops
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Self-trained neural networks provide the ability to recognize player's faces which is something none of us had really worked with before. Learning and accomplishing this task was not only a relief, but is a great building block for future projects to come.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of proper interfaces, all data can be moved with the proper setup and care put into the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snap Survival
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expansion, scaling the project to allow more players/more simultaneous games and of course more fun!
