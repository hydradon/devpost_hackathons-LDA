                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The field of bio-engineering is growing rapidly. Using a brain computer interface to analyze biological functions and direct habits proves a effective way to maximize your efficiency.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While wearing the Muse headset, your brainwaves are constantly analyzed and sent to a server for mathematical processing and modeling. We can classify ceritain frequencies of brain waves into different groups and use running averages of these groups to determine if you are tried, concentrated, or tired.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The company behind Muse no longer supports their developer SDK. We found old code examples across the internet and pieced together a working OSC server.

                <p>
                    Not much becuase no one owns the hardware to continue development.
