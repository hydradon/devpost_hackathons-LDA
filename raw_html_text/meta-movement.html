                    We developed our ideas through talking of personal everyday experiences. One of us discussed their concern with back pain and lack of sleep due to an irregular posture. Another teammate felt their incorrect running form was causing daily physical pain. The overall idea is to tackle health and wellness issues for the entire community. This means understanding proper form in physical activity, opportunities to correct spinal discrepancies and help people adjust their motion to prevent injury and pain. Our product focuses on creating personalized experiences for each person, understanding for example that women have different bodies and different needs in regards to support, motion etc. With using common materials and 3D printing technologies, we aim to develop an entire integrated line of clothing that is both affordable and accessible across social classes.

                    We found further inspiration in knit wear from Stoll where the interwoven conductive yarn provides a heating element for activewear geared to increase performance. With an interest in sustainability, our entire group worked to use as much recycled material and produce the least amount of waste as possible. In an ideal world, we would use more sustainable, environmentally conscious materials but we hope the thought process and concept are enough to provide us and other designers inspiration to further develop this into a common health and wellness choice.

                    Though it may not seem like it on the surface, we believe that we are targeting just one of a plethora of social injustices happening in our immediate environment. Health and wellness was a main topic that linked all of us together in the brainstorming process as it effects so many aspects in everyday life. We know that as designers, we have not only the knowledge but the opportunity to solve these kinds of issues in our environment, hoping that improving health and wellness would be just one step in providing a better quality of life across communities.
