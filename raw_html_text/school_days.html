                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the times when we as students were all wondering if we had a snow day the next day. Conditions like low temperatures, snow fall, sleet, salt on the roads, or power outages could predict the outcome the next morning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our code calculates the likelihood that a school day would be canceled. It takes in the various data such as: if there is snow, the snow fall, the temperature, if there was salt present on the roads, and if there were any power outages in the area. Based on these inputs, the web program gives an accurate prediction of whether or not there will be a snow day/classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed our code using css, html, and javascript on different compilers and text editors including atom, brackets etc. We also used our command prompts and terminals to push, commit, and add changes onto our GitHub repository.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used various API, such as a weather API, that can pull data from various geographical locations and use data such as temperatures, humidity, windspeed, to allow the user to enter their zipcode instead. We also used Twilio API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our troubleshooting and testing of our JavaScript code, our overall webpage design, the collaboration of the team, and being able to experiment with different API. Most importantly, the output was correct.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code more in JavaScript and use git commands.

                    We would like to turn it into a mobile application.
