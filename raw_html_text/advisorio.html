                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many Clemson students would love to get involved with CI's but there's so many that it's hard to navigate which ones are a good fit or even recruiting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using responses to Alexa's questions, our application compares the response text to descriptions of each CI at Clemson, to see which one's are a closer match.  The closest matching CI's are returned to you so you can reach out and possibly get involved!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa skill connects to a Django Backend hosted on Google Cloud.  This backend provides an api and an abstraction to an Amazon marketplace service for comparing documents.  CI descriptions were scraped from the Clemson CI page.
