                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this app was the numerous uwpd email we receive about attackers getting away. We wanted people to get help as fast as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a person is suspicious that they are being followed or going to be attacked, they can call for help with a simple tap of a button via our application. This will then alert everyone within 0.5 mile radius with the app that a peer is in need of immediate assistance. Once a good samaritan opens the application it drops a pin on the location of the person in need. The responders can then go assist the individual.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this android application using android studio which requires knowledge on java and xml. We also used firebase as our real time database to store the locations of users who require help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble integrating firebase with our android application. We were able to overcome this speed-bump by reading various documentation, video tutorials, and mentor-ship.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplishment we are proud of is being able to successfully use firebase and use android studio to develop our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As most of use have never used android studio before we were able to learn android studio and devlop an application
                </p>

                    What's next for Dawg Pack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing for Dawg Pack is to add the ability to call 911 or UWPD with a click of a button. We would also like to market our application to university to raise awareness and create a community of students and faculty dedicated to ensure the safety of their peers.
