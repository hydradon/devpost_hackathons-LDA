                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all know that there have been many awful things happening around the world, however, sometimes we do not realize that these situations can inspire us to become better and strengthen our communities. This is how we came up with the idea of Neighborly, a platform where you can help people in your community in situations of crisis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neighborly enables communication between community members that have been displaced from their homes after natural disasters and community members that can offer their homes as a shelter for those in need of a place to stay. By matching "shelter offers" with "shelter request" based on user data such as location, space available, length of stay, disability access and even if you can bring your pets!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift to develop the user interface, we used firebase and swift to develop the backend and managing the user input and saving it into the database. We developed our own matching algorithm based on the relevant user input and providing a "match score" for each shelter offer/request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first time users of XCode and Firebase, it was very difficult to get the environment set up and learn how to run queries on the database, as well as collecting the user input needed in order to run the matching algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very excited to have a complete product and to have been able to develop both the back end and the front end of this project. Even though integrating the two was definitely a challenge, we are proud to have been able to develop both sides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the developing process of an application. Asides from learning new technologies and programming languages, we learned that there is more to developing an application than just writing code. From UX / UI design to algorithm design we discovered many new parts of software developing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Neighborly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are excited to keep working on this project and making it more user friendly, as well as improving the matching algorithm and the security features.
