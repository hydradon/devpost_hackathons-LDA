                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college freshmen we spend a lot of time waiting in line for coffee at our local coffee shops near campus.  However, we wait WAY to long, often the line will take 20 and even sometimes 30 minutes.  We wanted to solve a problem that we experience everyday and know others face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One app allows for a platform for coffee shops to add their shops and menus.  The other app allows for users to order coffee and then be notified when his or her order is completed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made two iOS apps, one for cafes the other for general users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing apple pay and capital one banking was very difficult and we were not able to implement fully.
