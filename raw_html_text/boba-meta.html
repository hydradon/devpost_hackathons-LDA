                <p>
                    Boba's been trending. With people from all sorts of places craving boba milk tea, there have been attempts to decide on the best boba franchise out there. However, such a feat is infeasible, especially since the quality of boba drink usually depends on the management of an individual boba shop, rather than the chain as a whole. Thus, people should instead be comparing boba shops to other nearby boba shops. And Boba Meta was born.
