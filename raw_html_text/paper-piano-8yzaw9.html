                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all grew up playing many various musical instruments. We thought it would be a cheap way for people who aren't as fortunate to learn to play instrumental skills such as learning the piano and drums.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to draw out their instrument board and connect their shapes to various sounds (piano sounds, drum sounds, etc). The board is supposed to be drawn on a piece of paper, allowing all users to be able to afford learning and playing this instrument.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a front end with React.js and OpenCV with Python was used for backend, used with Numpy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble with building the website with React.js because it was our first time working with it. We also learned Figma which we weren't used to, and also other design techniques on our group member's iPad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that our project is able to detect your fingers pressing the shapes drawn on the board, and we can play different sounds from different shapes. Also, we learned to use Figma and was able to create some amazing designs for our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of webdev skills using React, JavaScript, Figma, OpenCV with Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Paper Piano
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the UI from the front end to the backend. We hope that many users who like learning instruments at a very low cost would use our project on a daily basis!
