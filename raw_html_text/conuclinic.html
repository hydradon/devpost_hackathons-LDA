                    This web app uses Nuance.mix API for voice recognition to help people with typing difficulties or people who are not tech savvy book appointments easily by voice.

                    This Web app is more of a proof of concept (example of a clinic) for a bigger web app that would integrate many different businesses that work on an appointment based schedule. For example the user could sign-in to a main platform and ask for an appointment with a lawyer and the app would process that request in the database and give the user different lawyers to choose from based on their need, and all of this with voice recognition for ease of use by all.

                    This project has been created by four 1st year software engineering students with close to no knowledge in html, javascript, API, and many more topics that we generally learnt from various mentors on the Nuance team, especially Vincent.
