                    What if you could Control+F a video?

                    Imagine if you were able to find exactly where in a video you want to go just with a simple voice command. That's what we have set out to do. Our project is essentially implementing Control+F functionality for a video, meaning we can search and jump to exactly to where we want quickly and efficiently.

                    As many of you know, Computer Science is largely a self taught subject. You won't be able to learn everything you need to succeed in a University Classroom, and taking to the internet for online lectures is sometimes a necessity. This would be a perfect scenario when our project could be used.

                    This software uses keywords you say to jump to a part of a given video.

                    Lecture videos often are full of content that we're not interested in. We wanted to make it easier for students to easily find what a professor had to say about a specific topic.
