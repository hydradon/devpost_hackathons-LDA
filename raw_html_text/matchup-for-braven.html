                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As aspiring engineers, we understand the difficulty of finding jobs right out of college. Braven's mission statement to help close the education-to-employment gap is something that we all felt strongly about. We felt like we could help contribute a change by helping Braven solve some of its problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MatchUp at its core is essentially a matching app dedicated to pairing students with interviewers in the most efficient and simple way possible. The process is optimized to make sure every student meets a certain quota of interviews, in addition to finding the best match career-wise. Along with the pairing, it will also allow students to receive feedback right after their interview, promoting improvement during the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way Matchup works is that the staff members and the students at Braven are able to check-in through a web browser. Through the implementation of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, we were able to design a website that would not be over complicated but instead straight to the point. One of the main focuses of our project was to design an algorithm that did not bring up many issues but was efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were two main problems we ran into which were: transferring information between different file types and structuring our matching algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the development of the website. We introduce the consumer on a page that welcomes them warmly, inviting them to a straight forward user-friendly interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement our coding skills into making the website, and storing information into the database. It took a significant amount of time to implement the data with our matching algorithm but eventually got it to become functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MatchUp for Braven
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that the future for MatchUp will continue to grow with the right support we need. For students to have the opportunity to be able to receive feedback after each interview is powerful. Thus, we think that MatchUp is a platform that will encourage students to attend to these events and to relieve significant stress on the user.
