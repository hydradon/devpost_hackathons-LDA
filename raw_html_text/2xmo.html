                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this program comes from our passion for space industrial companies as Physicist. Today we can see that we have more than 1500 satellite around the earth and our nowadays lifestyle is dependent on them. Also, with the private companies like SpaceX leading the space industries this beautiful an elegant part of Physics ( Orbital Mechanics ) is getting more important shows the world one of the most beautiful and peaceful applications of science in our life. Knowing this and the fact that it is very expensive to get a satellite into earth orbit we want to make sure about their safety to get to use the most of them. So we wrote this program to make sure about the safety of satellites from space accidents to happen between satellites and other objects in the space.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program simulates a conscious evasion from a collision by a satellite in an optimised way using random data collection methods developed by us and inspired form numerical Monte Carlo method in Mathematics. From our program, we can see a simulation that the satellite dodges an accidental celestial collision and after a significant change in momentum finds, autonomously, an optimised path of getting back into its orbit. Most satellites function using the solar power, and so, have a limited energy stored. Furthermore, the companies operating the satellites would like to decrease the down-time as much as possible to minimise the financial damage. So the optimisation aims to minimise the down-time whilst keeping the used energy below the stored value.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm is completely built in Java. It uses Newton's law of gravitation, his second law and a numerical integral calculus to find the position vector of the satellite at each given time.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    in order to visualise the best manoeuvre, we ran into some challenges to extract the best-analysed data from the program. Particularly the problem with multiple threads and the difficulties with keeping chronical track of each one's tasks.
