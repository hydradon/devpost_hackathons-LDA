                <p>
                    During Emergencies, first responders often don&rsquo;t know how to locate survivors and have to resort to exhaustively clearing locations and going to SOS signals.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Azure Notification Hub to ask users(survivors) if they are OK. We then built an Android app as the user(survivors) facing application that allows users to indicate whether they are OK or not OK. If they aren't OK, then we store their data in a Firebase Database. We then built a web application that takes the Firebase data and shows it on a map and displays a heatmap. This was all done via Google Cloud and Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally didn't plan on an Android app but wanted it all done via a notification alert (similar to AMBER alert). However it ended up being infeasible as notifications have limited customization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of bringing together different technologies in order to advance an idea that we truly think will positively impact the world and emergencies as we know it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Android programming and Firebase since we came in with almost zero knowledge about these two technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EASy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pitch it to the government as getting everyone to install an application on their smartphone for this express purpose is extremely difficult and borders on impossible. As the government is behind the AMBER alert, we believe that they will see the use in having this application and such an EASy way to find survivors.
