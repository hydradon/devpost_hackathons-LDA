                <p>
                    They say that what you say is not as important as how you say it. This seems to ring true especially when it comes to dating, where unconscious subtleties such as fidgeting, tone of voice, or using too many filler words, can mean the difference between a failed date and securing a second one. We noticed there are many speech and facial analyzers but no dating websites that incorporate them to help their clients asses their areas of weakness.

                <p>
                    In terms of front-end design, one of the challenges that we ran into was adding CSS PreProcessors into the documentation. Using an atomic design structure we tried to organize the code with SASS tools to streamline development process.

                    It would be quite interesting to allow the user to give us feedback after his/her date. This would allow us to tweak our algorithm to prioritize certain characteristics over others and look for new ones. As well, improving upon the user learning experience through progress checks, historical analysis, etc, would position us as a major provider of dating service. We truly believe that ultimately this company would either be acquired by eHarmony (the largest dating service that currently uses the most scientific method of matching individuals) or we would be a large competitor of theirs and a leader in dating preparation using vocal and body language analysis.
