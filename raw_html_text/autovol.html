                    Inspiration: When sitting on the bus or on the metro, the noise around us made it hard for us to listen to music without having to control the volume manually.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Takes measurements of the amplitudes of surrounding noises, and increases or decreases volume according to the amplitudes. The changes in volume are directly proportional to change in amplitude of surrounding sounds.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used Java in Android Studio, with API 19, suited for Android 4.4 and above.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Not able to fulfill every single goal we had planned. For example, we were not able to make the app a background-only service.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We were able to get the recording to work within our first few tries. We were also able to test the amplitude-measuring part of our app in different environments, including a silent environment (the auditorium where everyone slept), as well as the gym, where everyone worked on their hacks.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We were able to familiarize ourselves with Android Studio and Mobile Application Development, especially since most of us were more proficient in Web Application Development. Also, we learned how to debug our application throughout our journey of building the app, as well as troubleshooting the app whenever it was "dead."
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AutoVol: AutoVol could be made to function as a background service, as well as automatically start up when a headphone is plugged into the headphone jack. This would require more time and could also include the use of hardware as well.
