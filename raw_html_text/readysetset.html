                        "SET, the family game of visual perception"
                    </em>
                    is a game that rewards quick pattern matching and methodical analysis. The rules of the game are simple to understand, but hard to master: your job is to find sets of 3 cards that for which each of the 4 features that describe each card are either all the same or different. We decided that by applying AR, we could quickly teach new players the rules of the game and help them play competitively against their more experienced friends.

                    ReadySetSet is an Android phone application that overlays helpful prompts over the phone camera input to provide an augmented reality game experience. By scanning the playing area with your phone, you can use ReadySetSet to identify the presence or absence of potential sets in the playing area and reveal hidden sets if you are stuck.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the OpenCV library as the backbone for our computer vision system to recognize and classify playing cards. There were prototyped in python and then ported to an Android app. To classify playing cards, we used tools such as Histograms of Oriented Gradients, Support Vector Machines, and (Michael).

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The OpenCV library for Android is lackluster compared to its Python counterpart, so a large part of our development time was spent porting our computer vision code. In addition, our classifier for detecting patterns on playing cards suffered due to lighting issues, which meant spending a lot of time retraining our classifier to improve accuracy. Also, a significant hurdle was (Michael's stuff)

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project had a large computer vision aspect. Being able to synthesize multiple computer vision techniques into a seamless AR experience was a large undertaking unto itself, and so for us to be able to deliver a great product is enough cause for celebration!
