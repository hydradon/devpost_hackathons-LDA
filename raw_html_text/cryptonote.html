                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The internet is becoming more treacherous every year as hackers develop new ways to steal our information. Just recently, hackers found a way to break into phones protected by fingerprint recognition using a picture of a person's finger. For those who require a more secure way of saving information, a more creative encryption solution is necessary
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CryptoNote is a hub of features and storage protected by a musical encryption algorithm. Even if hackers gain access to your phone, this app will protect your most important information. The app uses an audio manipulation framework to generate new music that serves as the "password" for the system. Only the user knows exactly how to replicate the sound, and due to the human mind's natural inclination toward remembering sounds, this password will be significantly easier to memorize than equivalently secure text passwords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this IOS app in XCode using Swift, Objective-C, and C++. I used the SuperPowered SDK's mobile audio engine to perform the song manipulation. After the security check, the app contains a hub of features that I built using the Button framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the Superpowered SDK required the use of three different languages in the same project, which was hard to work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first project in Swift and I learned how to use a huge number of features of IOS development that I had previously avoided. I look forward to working on more Swift projects in the near future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Swift and C++. I really utilized the interface builder in XCode for the first time, which makes prototyping views significantly faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CryptoNote
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was more of a fun project than a viable project. Although I believe this encryption is as secure as any other password system, I don't presume to know more than the security experts who designed the systems we use today. I and many others would rather place the security of our data in their hands, so I don't foresee future development of this project past some polishing.
