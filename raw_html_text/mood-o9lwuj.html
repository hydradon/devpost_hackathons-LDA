                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create moOd because we've all been in the situation where we needed to take a quick break from work but ended up going online and falling into the endless depths of social media or tv streaming. We wanted to create an application that would help people destress and take the break they need without running the risk of no longer being productive. moOd is designed to be engaging, yet not something that would keep someone occupied for a long period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    moOd helps people relax by providing a collection of soothing and calming animations. The animations are a mix of ones that the user can participate in (i.e. moving the mouse around) and ones that are meant for spectating. Using a series of repeating actions, the animations help calm people down and allow them to focus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create our web application. We also utilized the Processing.js framework for the code for the different animations. Going through iterations of the project - from paper wireframes to different versions of the final product, we considered the implications of our choices on the user's experience. Keeping the overall design in mind, we chose to make it clean and minimalistic in order to keep the primary focus on the animations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Reflecting on the process (challenges, lessons learned, and things I'm proud of)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All in all, I'm proud of our project and that we were able to finish it in the time allotted. Throughout the course of the hackathon we went through a lot of different ideas and tried learning a bunch of new languages (Django, PHP, Ruby on Rails) mainly because we weren't sure which one would be the best to implement what we wanted to do. Originally we wanted to build a web app with database / backend features, but we struggled through putting it together with the  front-end part. This project idea seemed more feasible and gave us a chance to play around with Processing, which is something that we'd always wanted to learn but hadn't had the chance to. For me personally, this project allowed me to learn the foundations of Processing, which is something I'll definitely use in more advanced &amp; creative web development projects. Overall, we actually had a lot of fun making moOd and it's something that we would all use and enjoy using in real life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for moOd
                </h2>
                <p>
                    moOd is an application that could have benefited with the use of soothing sound / music in the background, which definitely would have augmented the calming effect. Other next steps would include tracking user engagement - potentially keeping metrics of how long users stay on each tab to see which animations or which types of animations keep users engaged the longest. With this data, we would be able to design more effective animations and improve our overall program.
