                    Our team wanted to simplify the process of scheduling any service. We decided to make a web application that keeps the experience of scheduling a service simple and consistent
                </p>
                <p>
                    Business' have the opportunity to create portfolios to demonstrate their skill set/service. On the portfolio the users can write reviews and schedule an appointment with this business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built the application using the standard web languages including jQuery and boostrap to simply the development process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Integrating different team member's code was by far the most difficult challenge for us. Designing the user interface was a challenge as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of every feature developed, but we believe each has room for improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned to integrate our code early and to integrate it often, especially in a hackathon enviornment.
