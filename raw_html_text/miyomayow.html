                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Empathy with inanimate objects

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It encourages you to exercise and take care of your phone, because not only is your and your phone's health at stake--your oniongarlic's is as well!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put together Google Fit data to find out when you reach an hour of exercise a day--a healthy, feasible goal that Google already sets as a baseline. When you exercise, your oniongarlic's health will grow. However, if your phone falls, it will tell you OW (via Text To Speech, a built-in Google feature), and your oniongarlic will lose health. We used data from your phone's built-in gyroscope and accelerometer to figure out when your phone is falling (or, if you're lucky, when you spin it)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of issues with Google Fit. Its API was not easy to use. We also aren't the best at physics, so using gyroscopes and accelerometers wasn't easy either!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a fun app, but it has serious possibilities for the future of how people and technology interact! (we are also pretty proud of this video)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to put so many different kinds of technology together (and in an Android app!), in a way that worked together really well
                </p>

                    Other habits to reinforce! Nutrition and sleep are some of our top priorities.
