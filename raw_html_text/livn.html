                        Our Design Principles
                    </strong>
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Social over financial
                        </strong>
                        . We want people to be able to understand and control their finances within their natural context consisting of social activities with friends and the people around them. We also want to focus on the human element of social currency rather than financial currency to give people a sense of purpose.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Elegant over vibrant
                        </strong>
                        . We want people to feel like they&rsquo;re important and in control of the system as if it&rsquo;s their assistant. We want to give people that feeling that everyone around them, including them, has money and are working towards their own goals. Vibrancy has the chance to break people into social groups, which could be detrimental to our system and what we believe in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Shareable over intuitive
                        </strong>
                        . We want people to learn about and how to use the application through engaging with other users. Therefore, we do not want the user to immediately &ldquo;get&rdquo; everything about the system, but to learn more over time from individuals that have invested and mastered the system, creating opportunity for social learning moments. This principles encompasses our belief that humans working together move the world forward.

                        <strong>
                            Short term memory over long term memory
                        </strong>
                        . We want people to interact with a system that resembles how the human mind works. This allows people to focus on creating constant memories and to focus on enjoying life. But this also allows us to create a system that allows the short term helps us learn about the future more quickly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Journey over moment
                        </strong>
                        . We understand that achieving financial independence is a journey and does not occur by chance and after one moment. So we want to help the user understand where they are along their journey, creating a radiance of confidence and improving their financial/social well being along the way.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                            Future over past
                        </strong>
                        . We want to help people use their imaginations to see the future they want and help them get there. Rather than focusing on the past memories, we help users find joy in creating and imagining memories that have yet to come. Allowing us to provide a solution that helps our users direct their lives in the direction they want it to go.

                    The problem we want to solve is enabling people to find financial balance. Our hypothesis is that by automating the bugeting process and encouraging users to focus on the things in their lives, we can help users save 10% more of their income on a monthly basis, while increasing their financial well-being.
