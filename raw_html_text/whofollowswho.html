                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Earlier this year, I web scraped the Twitter API to obtain a list of all of the follower IDs of each professional sports team for a project. However, I realized that such a database would best be served as an interactive tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows a user to see the shared followers between any professional sports teams. This is important as it allows one to study the idea of multi-fandom, in that a user from a particular city may support teams from that city. However, in markets where there is only one team, we can compare the followers of a particular team to see what other teams they most support. For example, do Utah Jazz fans support the Arizona Diamondbacks or the Colorado Rockies, in the sport of basebll.

                    D3.js, Javascript, and a whole lot of help from Ben.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    D3 being annoying, not knowing Javascript, nothing working, staying up for 36 hours straight
                </p>

                    Getting that first interactive visualization was an awesome feeling.

                    Asking for help is a good thing!
