                    So, I started out thinking about a possible social networking site that I could solve a problem for and I realized that among the people I know, Reddit is probably one of the most popular websites discussed. As a result, I decided to solve a problem that I noticed constantly on the website-- Scam. I decided to create a bot, using python, that would automatically sort through the numerous data and posts on Reddit and reconfigure that data to point out the users that constantly post Scam. Then, the bot automatically chooses one of the scam users and comments on the post to warns people not to upvote the post (due to the fact that it can be a scam). Although this concept was only performed on Reddit, the concept itself is viable for all sources of social media, making it a strong approach to ridding the world of scams.
