                <p>
                    Farmer&rsquo;s market&rsquo;s are all around us, but we don&rsquo;t know how many there are until you hear about it. All of us knew about local farmer&rsquo;s markets, but never knew how many there were. We wanted to extend the scope of farmer&rsquo;s markets, help promote the growth of local businesses, and support local goods. If the solution were to be implemented, users will be able to easily find farmer&rsquo;s markets in their area, support local businesses and connect with the community.

                <p>
                    Our solution is sustainable because it&rsquo;s easy to use and Meteor, the framework in which it was built on, has a dedicated community. The software and its components are kept up to date and there are detailed support pages. The software product satisfies today&rsquo;s needs and can be easily adapted to any changes that are required in the future. This can be run on a dedicated server or hosted on
