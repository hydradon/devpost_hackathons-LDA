                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine you can share this picture with an interlocutor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such opportunity will give you a lot of fun and will provide an absolutely new way of communication.

                            An application for VR-glasses, rendering a scene from voice description and allowing to share this scene online with your friends

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the hackathon we've chosen to create a prototype of the first product since it's more likely to be developed in 36 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've used pymorphy to pick out nouns and adjectives related to them, some stl-models that could be found in free access, react for the interface and threejs for rendering.
