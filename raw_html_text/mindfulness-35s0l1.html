                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love going to the mindfulness to see the dogs and just be able to separate ourselves from the stress of each day. However, it isn&rsquo;t always accessible, especially at night when we are doing homework cram sessions. So we decided to make a virtual representation of the mindfulness room
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have broken up our website into four distinct parts. 
The first part is our landing page, which has a relaxing ambience complete with a music player at the upper right corner. Next step is our relaxation virtual exercises:
1) The first one is the water therapy simulation. 
2) The next one we have is a personal canvas where you can draw to your heart&rsquo;s content. 
Thirds, we have the Wall of Happiness, and here we can write about anything that we are grateful. Right now, we are grateful to be at Hack CMU to see all of these fantastic projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The penultimate section of our website is a collection of  videos to aid in meditation, yoga, or breathing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we all know, you can never really relax without memes, so without further to do, introducing Doges and Pepes. So grab a friend and play along

                    How we built it

                    Coding a project in 24 hours sucks but was fun
