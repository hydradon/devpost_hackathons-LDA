                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to figure out how likely it would be that KU would cancel classes on a given day
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It calculates how likely KU would be to cancel class on a given day
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drake used Processing to take a large data sample from a weather data repository and narrow it down to 208 entries in the Jan, Feb, March interval we wanted
Jonathan used Python to implement a machine learning model with the data Drake had parsed, and he developed the overall interface as well
Jacob played Assassin's Creed Origins and was a role model for our sleeping habits
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drake had problems parsing the data, and finding a complete set of data for our 208 samples.
Jonathan had problems making the ML model for the weathermodel.py, and also managed to sleep for 12.
Jacob had challenges with the Hippodrome races in Assassin's Creed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire program. Just, the program, and the fact that it can actually kinda be used to a reasonable degree. Just take a above 40 percent chance as a pretty decent chance that school is going to cancel.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drake learned how to parse big data
I learned how to make a multiple regression model and parse csv files
Jacob learned probably something in Assassin's Creed Origins
He also learned how to hallucinate with great frequency (in Assassin's Creed Origins, of course)
