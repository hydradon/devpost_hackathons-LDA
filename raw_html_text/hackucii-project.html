                    A majority of the people in our group have little to no coding experience, with some only being exposed to coding this year. Being able to make a project with the little knowledge we have on coding was a massive achievement for us as a whole. This project required us to use the limited knowledge we had and expand it in a way that fit our needs for this project. Time management and teamwork were also crucial parts of completing this assignment. Although it is not the most elaborate assignment, it was a great feat for all of us.
