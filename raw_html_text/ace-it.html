                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meeting at the University of Washington Hackathon (Dubhacks) in 2019, our group was formed by chance. After twenty scrapped ideas, too many dabs, and a ton of laughter, Ace-It was proposed. We came up with Ace-It because we wanted to solve an issue we could all relate with. As we discussed common student issues, we all found out how frustrated we were about preparing for exams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users upload 2 files - a question set and an answer set. Ace-It (AI) reads the contents to randomly select a complete set of practice exams students or exams for professors. Databases will store all the questions for future use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split our team into three groups - front-end, back-end, design. We used some sample pdf as our database. The front-end and back-end teams used Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Visual Studio Code, and Google Cloud for the UI web design and the backend algorithms. The design team uses Canva as their main design tool, with the ideation and organization process done on procreate.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our input pdf files, there were superscripts which were hard to scrape through. 
We had a challenge with using the domain.com&rsquo;s access code and set up.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about collaboration in a diverse dynamic environment and technical knowledge.

                        Saves time for professors in creating quizzes and exams, allowing more time for more valuable tasks such as researching and assisting students
In the future, we could add a separate log-in for professors, who can create fair quizzes and exams with more ease.
