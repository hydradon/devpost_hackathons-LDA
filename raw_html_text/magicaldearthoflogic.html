                    Inspiration: I wanted to make an rpg akin to Mario &amp; Luigig: Partners in Time / Bowser's inside story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does: This is a very barebones comb at simulation for my future game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How I built it: I built it in java, using Java 2D.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges: Just about everything. Biggest challenge was probably reading my code and understanding it at 3 AM for the combat menu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments: I'm proud of just getting it so far. I didn't know I could make a game with a working combat menu, target select and rudimentary animations for taking damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I Learned: How to use bits and pieces of Java2D, and that menus are really complicated and need a lot of prethought to be streamlined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next Step for MagicalDearthOfLogitc: Rewrite some parts of the code to be more legible and more understandable, and then streamline the way that the menus work.
