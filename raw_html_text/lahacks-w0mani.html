                    We wanted to create an app that motivated people to improve their ecological footprint through a ranking system. We saw that people are motivated to improve something when they are ranked amongst other users. We used this motivation to create an app that took a user's ecological footprint and ranked them with other users. This creates an environment that motivates people to improve their ecological footprint and help the environment.
