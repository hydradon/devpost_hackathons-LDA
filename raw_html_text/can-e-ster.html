                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all live in apartments with multiple people (10 people in mine) and we struggle with keeping track of who consumes how many beverages from a shared amount of cans. This tends  to bring up problems when splitting costs for beverages. We also are not unfamiliar with overconnsumption and wanted to create something that would set a limit for how much one can drink in a certian period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Can-e-sther helps you by storing cans and assigning numerical codes for each user. This way when a person tries to take a drink and introduces their specific code Can-e-sther adds it to the amount of cans taken and by that user and displays the updated intake from all users.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed an arduino to receive input from a keypad. Depending on the command introduced our device adds an user, resets drinks or tries to dispense drinks for the user. After programming the keypad command and communication with the Arduino we programmed the LCD screen to display the resultant message from our system and a stepper motor connected to a motor driver to rotate the required angle to drop a single can and hold the next one in queue. After finishing the circuitri and programming we 3D printed a stepper coupler to work as a wall to dispense and lock cans when required.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Measurements and mechanical concepts became complicated when implementing and putting together all of the final pieces, as certain situations where hard to predict without real testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The final device is customizable for multiple situations and works reliably. Working with all the new components  after just 36 hours was also a big accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To use new components and how important real testing is to achieve a good enough implementation of any idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Can-E-Ster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refrigeration and bluetooth connection  to communicate to all the users with an app instead. This would make it a better, more user friendly experience. Also its design is open to many more perks (i.e. finger print sensor, pressure).
