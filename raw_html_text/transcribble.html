                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a student journalist and Editor in Chief of my high school newspaper and I wanted to create an app that would help my fellow journalists easily transcribe the long interviews they often record for the stories they wrote.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transcribble allows users to convert any voice memo into text. Using powerful Speech Recognition technologies, Transcribble is able to provide readable, quality transcriptions almost instantly. Once transcribed, users can listen back to the recording as well as edit, save and share any transcriptions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Transcribble using Swift, Apple's Speech Recognition Framework, and Firebase as well as Apple's Action Extension capabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into many challenges working with the app extension as I've never worked with one before and it is quite difficult as its almost like an extra app attached to the original! I also encountered challenges trying to store and retrieve the audio files I wanted to upload to Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm very proud of being able to learn to use an app extension and using the speech to text framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to work with Firebase, Apple's Speech Framework, and how to code an app extension!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Transcribble
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, I want to implement in-app recording and add sharing capabilities that allow you to share the recording (currently, it can only share the text with others).
