                    When we travel to a new city, there are some points of interests (POI) that we all want to visit. However, most of us may just spend several minutes taking some photos and leave. We think this kind of travel experience is NOT OPTIMUM! We do think the tourists would like to know more about the history background and the fun story behind these famous points of interests.

                    As a result, we developed this Tour++ app, which can provide self-triggered audio guide when the user is approaching a POI. It can provide the user with the historic events, fun stories happened at the POI like a real tour guide. Moreover, it can accompany you to anywhere in the world, working 24/7, and it is

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used nodeJS at the backend and pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript at the front end. We also used Google Map API, Google Place Search API, Wikipedia API and Text-to-Speech API from ResponsiveVoice TM.
