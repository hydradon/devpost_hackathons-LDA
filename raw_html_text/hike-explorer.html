                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a game to enjoy the challenge of hiking with a bit of a funny twist
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a PC game which puts you in the hands of a hiker trying to climb mountains from all around the world
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity for the Game Engine and C# for the scripting and I used Krita to create the images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A large challenge was ensuring the build for Unity reflected the editor build since there was a lot of problems due to the 
program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of putting a very small idea (having stretchy limbs) and running with it to create a fully working app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned quite a bit of Unity systems, how to debug C# code and learn the ins and out of Game Development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hike Explorer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add more levels and in the end, create a full game to be released to the masses.
