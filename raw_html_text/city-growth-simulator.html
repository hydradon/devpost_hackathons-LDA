                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be interesting to try and simulate a number of cities to find the optimal food supply to population ratio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses formula to calculate and update population constantly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Processing software and API to render our project and we used Java to write it.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to restart since our first model was too complicated
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have a working model...
