                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    every time I go out with friends we always want to do something but never know where to go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    once you open the app its a map that has pins of areas and if you click on the pin you can see pictures of that pinned area and you can make pins yourself if you create an account!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the app in Xcode using the language swift and importing geofire and firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a hard time being able to retrieve pins from firebase and deleting pins if the user didn't mean to create a pin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of this app even though it is not completely finished because it is a extremely ambition app that has many features but I started at Make School with no experience in swift and I believe I have come a long way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I became very familiar with the MKMapView and all of its features and I learned the basic fundamental steps it takes to create an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Discover
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are still so many features I plan on adding and after doing user testing I got more feedback which I will implement into Discover.
