                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our love of video games and meeting new people inspired us to create BuddyCade. BuddyCade allows you to connect with your surrounding peers through a mobile multiplayer arcade experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on your proximity, your mobile device can connect to an arcade room where you can play a real-time multiplayer mini-game with nearby people. The games are simple, intuitive and fun for everyone to enjoy together. The purpose of the app is to allow you to meet new people by sharing these short, but fun times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BuddyCade is an iOS application created with Swift, developed in Xcode. It implements Sprite-kit, Gameplay kit, and Multipeer Connectivity in order to create a seamless experience. The graphics and U/I were designed using Adobe Photoshop and Gimp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have enough time to implement more than one game for our arcade. However, we plan to scale this up in the future. Another challenge we faced was setting up the real-time multiplayer connection. We solved this by implementing the Multipeer Connectivity API provided by Apple. A lot of the time we spent during the Hackathon was researching this area of focus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the ability to connect multiple mobile devices to a single game room in which the game was synched up for all users in real-time. The user interface is another area we are proud of because we incorporated friendly sprites, which are inviting to new users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team gained more experience with developing for iOS apps, particularly using Swift, the Gameplay kit, and the Multipeer Connectivity API. Communication and teamwork are essential to creating and reaching an end goal in the limited time provided for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BuddyCade
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step is to add more games to our arcade, as well as improving the games we already have. A feature we plan to incorporate is a chatroom for app users to have a conversation with the people they share the game experience with. This way, more people have an incentive to meet and bond over a fun app. Other features we will add includes linking up to the Apple Game Center, setting up leaderboards, and giving users the choice to customize their profiles.
