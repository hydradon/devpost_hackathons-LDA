                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Procrastination is every college student's worst uncontrollable lifestyle nightmare. Every single college student can admit to procrastinating instead of studying whether its through cleaning, eating, sleeping, working out, or worse through social media, game, sports, or any other applications or webpages. It's time to take control of the amount of time we spend on social media by collecting data of our social media application usage and make goals to minimize the time we procrastinate! There is only one way to do this..... available soon through Google Play on your Android... Distracker!!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Distracker is an application that measures how much time an individual spends on distracting social media applications!
It runs securely in the background on an individuals mobile device, measuring and reporting the time an individual spends on social media applications on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.
                    <strong>
                        bold
                    </strong>
                    Features:
-Notifies an individual how much time they have spent on social media applications
-Logs the individuals daily, weekly, and monthly usage
_ italics _ See our attached pictures for mockups of our proposed application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We develop Distracker on the Android Studio and used the UsageStatsManager to pull app usage analytic from our android devices. With this information, we are able to create visuals for users to identify the amount of time they've spent on certain social media apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -3/4 of us were unable to successfully compile the project within Android Studio
-Due to the problem above, we fell behind schedule and was unable to implement all the features of Distracker
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of working cooperatively in a team. Despite technical difficulties, we were able work collaboratively. With our strong team bond, we were able to have fun time at Hack Western 2 and continued with our project with optimism and hope.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to download the proper software for development before hand because that is where we lost the most time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Distracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Expand the distraction tracker to all applications, including: all social media, game, sports, and any other applications
-Add a blocking application feature which allows the user to block usage on an application for a certain period of time or to block them completely
-Add notifications to inform users of how much time they are spending on certain applications
-Set goals in order to reduce the time an individual spends on their mobile device
-Set alarms when an individual spends more than x amount of hours on a certain application
-Send weekly emails summarizing the users activities and productivity for that week
-Expand to businesses and allow them to use our data log of all of the users to identify how much time users spend on each application
