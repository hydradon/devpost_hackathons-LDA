                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really like Mario Kart, and I thought it would be cool to make it. It's 2D because we don't know enough programming knowledge or have enough time to make it 3D.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a 2 player game. You both race to see who can finish the track the fastest (no cheating allowed).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html, javascript, and css. We used repl.it. First we got the player and track sprites. Then, we put the players on the track. Then, we got the players to move. Then, we got the players to turn. Then, we made the game detect who won.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were unexpected problems at every step. Things like getting the player sprites actually on top of the track, getting jQuery, and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of all of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned many things, like how to get arrow keys to work, how object collision works, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mario Kart 2D
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more collision detection so it's harder for you to cheat. After that, more customization (unlocking new characters/tracks).
