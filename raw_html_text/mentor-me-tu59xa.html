                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were particularly inspired by the opening speakers' talks about how important mentorship is for young female girls, so we created this WebApp to help with mentees match with mentors directly from the workplace. MentorMe is meant for middle school students to find an inspiration in the workplace so they can have more successful careers after school.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MentorME is a web platform that allows female middle and high school female students to have access to a pool of talented career women who can coach girls and act as a role model in their personal lives to inspire the next generation of girls to strive for their dreams. In essence, it connects girls in traditionally low-performing school districts with women willing to be mentors to exchange ideas and have a source of outside support.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the landing page functionalities using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. For the backend, we used Python and JSON.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried implementing the Gmail API to automate sending a confirmation email to the mentee for signing up and matching them to their mentor, but this turned out to be extremely difficult. We solved this challenge by creating a page at the end that contained all the info that we planned to email out. Additionally, we also had a lot of problems using GitHub, but after spending 3 hours with a mentor, we were able to set it up and push our code.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon, and our group collectively only had the experience of going to one cs class. We are proud of how much we learned regarding front end development and the relationship between the two, as well as how to use github
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to build some parts of a product that has the potential to be client-facing. We learned a lot about CSS and html, and how to use bootstrap to make websites more aesthetic. We also learned the basics about object oriented programming, and it was fascinating to learn about companies integrate CS into their overall business model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mentor-Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to create another version that allows for mentor registration as well. We want to add in a few more pages, as well as a general info page about the organization. In addition, we would like to see a place for multiple students to be assigned to a mentor, and to build the mentor-facing dashboard portal as well. We would also like to add a calendar capability for students to be able to request sessions with a mentor and schedule it on their calendar.
