                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea came about when two of our peers could even get a proper push-up during the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It almost replicates the push-up machine found during IPPT sessions. It ensures that the proper form and posture is executed so that it would be counted as a successful repetition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the KinectSDK, OpenCV and other Python Libraries during this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the hardware was a challenge. We did not manage to the XBox One's Sensor so we had to settle with the XBox 360's Sensor. Another challenge was the setup. There are a limited number of resources available online and it did not help that Kinect was discontinued a few years back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get the Kinect working without many available online resources. It is also our first attempt working with Kinect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt to embrace challenges and discuss difficulties, solve problems together, be really interested to create, enjoy ourselves, and be cheerful. We also learnt that time management is very important in Hackathon.
