                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most task lists (or to-do lists or reminders) don't allow nesting items, which is sometimes a desired feature, and is a useful one to have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to create nested task lists. You can make them private, share them with your friends, or allow the whole world to see and/or collaborate on your task lists.
It also provides auto-correction (with the aid of the Bing Spell Check API).

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end is mostly built with Vue.js, while the back-end is written in Python. It is hosted on a Microsoft Azure server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My main challenge with the front-end was with complexity of allowing nested entries (let's use recursion), while maintaining a simple user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've attempted to create something that is, in theory a fairly simple idea, but in practice, a very challenging prospect. I do, however, like that the user interface remains fairly clean and intuitive throughout the nesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, the trade-offs of simplifying the database design may complicate other things.

                <p>
                    Improved social/sharing features.
