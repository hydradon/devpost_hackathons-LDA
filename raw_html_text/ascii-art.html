                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I saw some ASCII online it looks really interesting to me so I tried to make a converter that could do the same thing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope it could convert most of the .jpg, .png, and .gif to an ASCII art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used python and the 2 library imageio to make the .gif ASCII file and pillow to process the normal .jpg and .png image files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had some difficulties on how to convert the text files into the ASCII gif because it hard to find the correct ratio when converting the txt files back into the gif file.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did what I wanted to do, and give my friends and I some fun time messing around with it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learn how to use 2 new libraries for python and become more familiar with python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ASCII Art
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will try to make the GUI looks better and give the user more customization of the output file, because so far the size of the output is hard coded
                </p>
