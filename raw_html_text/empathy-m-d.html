                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members is an oncologist with 18 years under her belt. She learned through experience that empathy is essential for establishing trust in a patient-physician relationship. Current methods of training include participating in optional workshops which are found to be too time consuming and costly for doctors and medical students. This is why we came up an app for users to learn empathy through simulations and practice at their own time, only taking 5-15 minutes out of their day for each lesson.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app, Empathy M.D., is built to train doctors how to properly communicate with patients in various situations. The simulations vary from a simple diagnosis to disclosing bad news. By using the app, doctors and students can learn in a step-by-step process by watching short videos and taking lessons supported by AI technology.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built through Swift language and API to implement AI into the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we don&rsquo;t have many software engineers on our team, extensive research was needed on how to utilize AI in enhancing the app&rsquo;s functions. We also needed to view from a physician perspective when accounting for the average length of time required to connect with a patient while fulfilling the main objective of an appointment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with the solution which matched the needs of doctors and also successfully differentiated it from existing solutions by implementing an app and AI technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We overcame how difficult it was to make an app aimed at busy doctors and students when software expertise is lacking. To enhance the quality of the app, artificial intelligence and other technologies were learned and implemented.
