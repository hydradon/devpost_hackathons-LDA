                <p>
                    From the ground up this repo will be built around the VRP problem applied to
pickup and deliveries, where pickups and deliveries are both fellow ride-share
participants and identified public litter to be disposed.

                <h2>
                    The Vision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally the functionality developed will be exposed to users through both mobile
and browser-based interfaces. Geographic location functionality should be
computed and managed under the hood. All the users should do is say they are
looking for a driver or a ride. Once the ride is established the team will both
complete the objective of bringing both the driver (optional) and the rider to
their respective destinations and rack up points by hitting either hotspots for
litter or identified items to be disposed. A more advanced direction for this
software would be to integrate with various peer-to-peer social media platforms
to allow for seamless participation.

                <p>
                    My goal is to learn how to use Google OR Tools. In the spirit of the competition
and it's theme (see
                    <a href="https://2019-philly-codefest.devpost.com/" rel="nofollow">
                        philly codefest
                    </a>
                    ),
this technology will be leveraged to initiate a
                    <em>
                        clean up program
                    </em>
                    to alleviate
the city and all its citizens of the growing pollution concern.

                <p>
                    The theme of the hackathon is economic inequality. Performing some brain
gymnastics, this idea will bring together all levels of economic class for a
common goal. But gynastics aside, the competition lists that environmental
saftey is in fact a category of focus. So this falls under there.

                <p>
                    This could be broken down into participants (seeking rides) and destinations.
Destinations can be further broken down into requested drop-offs and litter
pickups. Litter pickup
                    <em>
                        destinations
                    </em>
                    can be associated with either known
litter hotspots or geo-tagged items.
                    <em>
                        "Wait! If you're going to go out of
your way to tag litter, why not just pick it up?"
                    </em>
                    Well A. the
                    <em>

                    </em>
                    is
extremely scalable. So while at the start of this software's development the
                    <em>
                        tagging
                    </em>
                    is very rudimentary and requires manual data entry, ideally this will
evolve into more passive
                    <em>
                        tagging
                    </em>
                    , making the argument that "it takes time to
                    <em>
                        tag
                    </em>
                    so why not just clean up" less effective. B. some people just won't do
anything, and that's their nature. You're more likely to get them involved by
providing this alternative than changing their personality and such.

                    While this program is pickup and delivery oriented, in the sense that
a rider is picked up and delivered, the way to model this problem is to solve
it as a

Note that wherever the model is described as

                        pickups and deliveries
                    </em>
                    , that is
incomplete and outdated in this software's documentation. The way to solve this
is more likely a combination of a capacity problem, penalties, and pickups and
deliveries.

rider.

                    There are several phases identified for the program's development. In order to
compete in Philly Codefest 2019 I'll need to tackle simplified sprints. In
an order of simple to complex:
                </p>
                <p>
                    A. Python Package: from the perspective of social network platforms, this
software in its simplest form can be a package that developers can integrate
with their users. Every social network platform can allow for their users to
register with the software and its environment. Then each user can utilize the
low-level capabilities and ranking system.
A.1. Install the package and its dependancies.
A.2. Integrate the main wrapper with your user models.
A.3. Surface resulting data and visuals, along with this software's data
models representing ranking and user analytics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    B. Python Package and Website: A with public-facing website to house ranking,
independent participation, etc.
TODO:

                <p>
                    C. Stand alone software: Mobile web app used similarly to Uber and Lyft but
as a social platform. The most advanced version of this software could provide
monetary dimensions.
