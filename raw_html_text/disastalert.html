                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Disaster relief is rough on all parties, and first responders are often faced with a very tough task of locating and assisting those in immediate medical need. People not being able to be located in case of emergency assistance, or in the case that someone is unsafe and needs immediate emergency response is never a good situation and may result in severe life threatening consequences. Disastalert wishes to relieve some of the pressure from first responders by making their job a little easier.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the background of the app, the users location will be tracked, and the location data will be passed to Here.com's Severe-Weather-Alert-API. This API will check for severe weather conditions in the users area and notifiy the user, prompting the user to identify as Safe or Not Safe and in need of emergency services. 
First responders jobs will be made easier by the emergency signals our app broadcasts. People will be able to broadcast if they're safe or unsafe and need immediate medical attention or evacuation via emergency signal that is sent to our back-end services and then forwarded to first responders. This forwarded signal is also able to be picked up by our Qualcomm backed Locater. Locater's are given to first responders to track emergency broadcasts on-the-go.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using android studio, AQuery libraries, here.com's severe-weather-alert-api, mongodb, google-maps-api, react.js, and Qualcomm's 410c board. The software is primarily for phone/tablet devices via app, and in the future wish to produce hardware specific distress equipment disguised as jewelry, [bracelets, necklaces,rings]. Our website is primarily for user sign up/registration/account information.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new libraries such as AQuery, which is a JQuery library for Android apps. Android studio does not play well as usual so that was also really fun. Learning new frameworks with React.JS presented it's own issues.

                    We all learned a lot in such a short amount of time and really taking the time to enjoy this experience.

                <p>
                    In the future wish to produce hardware specific distress equipment disguised as jewelry, [bracelets, necklaces,rings]. Using devices accelerometer sensor to help those with physical injuries not related to weather or natural disaster.
