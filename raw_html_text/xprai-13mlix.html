                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Depression is a major part of society, and our program can hopefully diagnose depression, by using your facial features, and your words
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Primarily uses facial features to determine emotions, and asks you a series of questions to determine your emotional state (happiness, sadness, depression)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used OpenCV to determine the facial features, and the other libraries were used after OpenCV to determine emotional state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't load the data that we needed to use for this specific project, so that we could create our lexicon. This took a while to figure out, because the text file with the lexicon was incredibly laggy, but eventually we were able to import the lexicon into our program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using haarcascades to determine facial features
Incorporating nltk, and openCV together to create something possibly helpful for society
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about nltk, and how it can be used in a variety of problems and situations, and it isn't necessarily just linguistics.
                </p>

                    What's next for XprAI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing our own TensorFlow ML model to increase accuracy.
