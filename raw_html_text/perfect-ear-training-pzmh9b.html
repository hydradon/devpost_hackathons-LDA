                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I (Bobby) have always wanted to learn to hear a note and recognize its pitch. It's an invaluable skill to music performers, composers, and theorists, and as all three, I wanted to make this for myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa gives you a random chromatic note and asks you to identify it. If you get it right, she tells you good job. If not, she asks you to try again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, you can change difficulty level and instrument depending on your preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used an Amazon Lambda Function for the back end (with JS), S3 for the database of notes requested.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into problems with persistence. I'll fix this in a future version.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really like the way I did the audio tags for the notes Alexa plays. Instead of having a different tag for each note, I build the tag dynamically based on the chosen instrument and note, assuming that the .mp3 file will be at the other end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about JavaScript, SSML, and the AWS services.
