                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the growing trend of readily available augmented reality and virtual reality applications and tools on the market, as well as wanting to find a way to help connect people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apparition allows people to create art in any form at any time and any place. Apparition gets your GPS coordinate and your camera to allow you to post art at a location, that anyone else who has Apparition can see even in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apparition was primarily build on Unity for our front end, and Google's Firebase was our backend. Through Unity, we used googles experimental AR kit the render our in house drawing interface, and track GPS coordinates. All drawings and their locations are stored on Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While AR tools and applications are really popular right now, it was actually quite challenging to find a sturdy AR tool that worked for our specific environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the depth of our idea and our willingness to complete it. We are also very proud of how this platform can expand upon the current accessibility to art and creative outlets in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Unity, C#, and Firebase. We also learned how to work better as a team and do extensive debugging in a limited amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Apparition
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we would like to add features that more social such as "liking" pictures, endorsing and donating to specific art pieces to allow creators to not only stay on the platform but to also have incentive to make more of their art.
