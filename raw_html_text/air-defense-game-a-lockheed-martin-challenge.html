                    Inspiration: Wanted to work on a simple yet innovative project this hackathon and Lockheed Martin gave me the perfect challenge
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It's an arcade game of a fighter jet flying and destroying other aircrafts
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I built it using Python language and Pygame library (Ps. Pygame is the worst library to make a game.)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Trying to figure out the algorithms.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: Finally I am proud of how aesthetically good looking this game is. I tried my best to make it look good.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: The extremes of staying awake for 36 hours and sustaining own self with total 3 hours of sleep for two days.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Air Defense Game (A Lockheed Martin Challenge): It's just a demo for now, It's quite impossible for one man to create an entire game completely single handedly, But I would definitely like to further develop this game if I see any opportunity.
