                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the world becomes more digitally connected between customers, enterprises and devices, a customer&rsquo;s digital identity is the core of our digital interactions. We envision companies and governments can issue a digital identity that is interoperable and accepted by any type of requesting party&rsquo;s technology through a new enterprise platform product.  Moreover, customer profile attributes are shared with consideration of privacy by design as an attestation (i.e. binary yes/no response for over 21) without sharing the data itself.

                        An application that allows a service provider to scan QR codes from users in order to verify any requirements they might have (ex. a bar checking if someone entering is of legal drinking age)

                        Made two frontends, one for the user with their unique QR code, one for the service provider to verify the qr code/user token and pull the specific information needed from the API.

                    <li>
                        Developed HDQL ("HDQL Data Query Language") and a parser for it to make a simple secure language for developers to create their own specific queries (like to check if someone is either above age x or below age y, or any other possibly more specific query)
