                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of students with both computer science and medical science backgrounds. We wanted to build an app that would improve the efficiency of treatment in hospitals, especially since long wait times have become a major challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Medical residents are assigned with patients within the hospital. However, before they are able to execute their diagnostic decisions, they must receive approval from the attending physician. Currently, this is done via pen, paper and chasing the attending physician around the hospital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Med Manage is a platform that allows the attending physician to easily manage and communicate with their medical residents on matters related to the resident's patients. Both residents and the attending physician can view patient information, and chat about each individual patient's treatment plan.
                </p>

                        Azure took a long time before it was activated and could be of use.

                    <li>
                        Challenges with the Moxtra API (however thanks to the Moxtra team we were able to overcome them!)

                        Rome wasn't built in a day. A polished application takes a lot of planning, teamwork and development.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also learned a lot about web development and database management, which was all mostly new to us.
