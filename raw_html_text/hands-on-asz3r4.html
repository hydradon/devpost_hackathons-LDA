                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are in 2016 and still we don't have a standard and user friendly solution to TV remote controllers.
We then decided to conceive a new user control experience for smart TV, desktop apps, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a prototype of a remote controller that uses MEMS, in our particular case a smartphone Accellerometer. 
The idea would be to integrate the needed sensors in a small portable device, possibly wearable, like a bracelet or a ring.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build a simple android application that is sending data via UDP to our Desktop application. 
We implemented also an example of a SmartTV application that communicates with an android app, but the prototype was not completed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate the multiscreen functionality into a native android application. The set-up of the project took quite a long time just to get everything running.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that our idea is new, easy to understand and to implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned something about the samsung smart tv app implementation. We also reinforced our android dev skills.
