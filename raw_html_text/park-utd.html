                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked at a common problem that occurs here at UTD, and that is finding parking.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app that we developed looks to see where vacant spots are on campus for the students.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In terms of building the project we used python and OpenCV along with javascript and Amazon Alexa. One of the main challenges we faced was how to detect where vacant spaces were in the parking lots. Utilizing OpenCV we can detect these spaces that are vacant and non-vacant and return it back to the App and Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We followed an misguided outline for implementing our own Alexa lambda function. The correct version of the platform is written in javascript while we built our initial version in python.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to be able to detect with high accuracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    However, we learned there are limitations to what we can accomplish. OpenCV is not compatible with all versions of Python, and some parking structures have different angles of light that can misclassify what type of parking is their.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next goal would be to make a full implementation of the system for testing and gather analytical data.
