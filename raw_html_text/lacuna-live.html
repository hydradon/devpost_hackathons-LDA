                    we asked tenants and management to understand the current pain points of the space. Turns out there are a handful. But nonetheless, people love the artsy and open building and the amazing people and businesses it houses.

                    We want to show the exciting "inside" of lacuna to the world to attract visitors (and potential tenants) as well as foster and enable its community, which will then lead to more "outside" interest. It's a reinforcing cycle!!
