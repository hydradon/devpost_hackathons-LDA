Canadian Problems: A Game For Canadians By Canadians

                    Name of the project:
Canadian Problems
                </p>
                <p>
                    Program Used: 
Game Maker Studio 2
                </p>
                <p>
                    Format:
Desktop Game
                </p>
                <p>
                    Targeted Audience:
Canadians who love maple syrup and who want to protect their home from bears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Purpose:
Be entertained in a humourous Canadian way as well as a simple exhibit a sense of patriotism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Description of the project: 
In this game, the player throws snowballs at bears and collects bottles of maple syrup falling from the sky. The player has to hit the bears three times for them to disappear, all while avoiding shooting the bottle of maple syrup. If a bear touches the player, or a bottle of maple syrup gets hit with a snowball, the game is over. By killing the bear or collecting the falling bottles of maple syrup, players accumulate points which is used to gauge their aptitude.

                    Creative Process:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenging as it proved, it was very important to us that our entire game be made from scratch. All the sounds including voice lines, the background song, the programming, and the art are completely made by us (for our background song we were certainly inspired by the Canadian anthem though!).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technical Aspects:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Game Maker Studio 2 to create the game. We used various online tutorials to explain certain fundamental aspects of the program, however no tutorial existed for exactly the kind of game we wished to make; therefore, in our game, we combined many mechanics explained in various websites. The programming of the game was our greatest challenge: none of us had any experience programming or coding before this morning.
