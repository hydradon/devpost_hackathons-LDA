                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide a solution for people who can't afford musical instruments, and a new music development experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It translates finger motion and gesture into musical notes and is extensible to any audio file. We realized that as a new HCI device with 10 analog inputs and any number of gestures, this can be used to wirelessly interact with many other applications.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We focused on areas we were individually strong at, and used spark core for the center of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Harvard made it very difficult to connect anything wirelessly due to their network authentication, so we had to set up our own ad-hoc network. This caused much instability and made us question the source of error. Additionally, the circuitry surrounding 10 fingers provided for much confusion and mistakes.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have any experience with embedded systems, but were able to pick it up and as a team produce something that is cool, and somewhat works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how difficult dealing with such low level systems is.
                </p>

                    What's next for hand simulator 2015
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should probably make it work before going into large scale production!
