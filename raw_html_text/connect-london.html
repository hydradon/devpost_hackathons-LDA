                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two years ago, an especially eventful "fake homecoming" left an 89-year-old Broughdale avenue resident with a front yard garden planted by her late husband completely destroyed by a portion of the 11,000 students who attended the event. A GoFundMe campaign was set up by a group of students and funds were raised to support the replanting of the garden. Even with widespread support online, only a handful of students showed up to help, most only because they had passed by on their way to class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Problem:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the past 20 years, massive leaps in technological innovation have revolutionized the way work, play, and interact with each other. The prevalence of technology in our everyday lives has created a number of challenges for younger generations, most of whom haven&rsquo;t known a life without computers. Media consumption is at an all-time high with most adolescents spending nearly 8 hours a day consuming media, with 95% of teens and young adults owning a smartphone. Along with an increased dependency on electronic devices and social media comes a notable rise in mental health issues alongside a decrease in social and community involvement, especially with the high-school and college-aged population.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connect London is a mobile app that connects London youth with their community, with a focus on social responsibility, community participation, and active lifestyle events. Anything from volunteering opportunities to last-minute pickup soccer games around the city will be made available with a proximity-based map and list. Connect London will also support a voice-activated search, offering a turn by turn navigation tool for hands-free use when on the road.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using Java, The London Open Data API and Google Cloud Speech to text
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge we faced was pinpointing the right solution to address the lack of community involvement in today&rsquo;s youth. We also faced challenges in implementing the mapping and navigation in our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have a functional application with all the main features that we had envisioned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project helped us with further developing our app development skills and helped us realize the challenges that come with it.

                    What's next for Connect London
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our Connect London app, we plan on implementing authentication and user login, safety and security measures as well as showing the number of people attending events.
