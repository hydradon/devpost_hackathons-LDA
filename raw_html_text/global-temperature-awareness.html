                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Natural disasters are on the rise and are becoming more frequent around the world. In particular the number of citizens dying from heat strokes is rising in the US and the rest of the world. As well as heat strokes, hurricanes and storms are becoming more prevalent and deadlier than ever. We are inspired to create a tool than can help people make long term decision based on the risk associated with living in regions that are expected to become increasing difficult to inhabit as a result of global temperate rise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this web application is to spread the awareness and the increase of temperatures in regions around the world. Global warming is a real problem that needs to be prevented and the only ones that can make the changes are the people around the world. The predicted time(years) to live at an inhabitable temperature is purposely done to send a shocking message and show global warming is real.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built with JavaScript on React framework. We used Google Maps API and Meteostat API (Historical weather data).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The meteostat API was unstable at the end of our day 2 and had to rely on waiting on it's API calls for hour limit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our ability to continue seeking new knowledge and challenges in all areas related to programming and web design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned some API providers are unreliable and issue arise that are unforeseeable could occur in times least expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Global Temperature Awareness
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is projecting the awareness of global warming and encourage preventative actions to stop global warming, e.g. decreasing pollution.
