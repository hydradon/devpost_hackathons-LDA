                    Problem with Yelp:
    * Lots of irrelevant material when it comes to deciding what to order
Solution:
* DOOR - Deep Object-Oriented Recognition
* A quick way to process information and decide what to order and what to avoid
Method:
* Long Short-term Memory Embedded Neural Network that really understands the concept of food
* Essentially insert text (one sentence or 10 million reviews) and we will extract all of the food words
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>* The network doesn't use explicit dictionary (or else we won't be able to discover food terms not in list)
* Network learns to categorize each food based on context, term freuquency, linguistic relationship to 
search concept and neighboring words. The actual word is the least important aspect)

* In many ways this is how we learn about concepts. If I gave you a sentence with a foreign foodand told you 
to find the word, most of you will be able to do. The algorithm works the same way.
