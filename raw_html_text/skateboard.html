                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build an app to save money together for road trips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users have profiles and can create piggy banks with their friends. Users have personal balances, which can be drawn from a credit card. Personal balances can be added to piggy banks, and money can be withdrawn from piggy banks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used firebase to store information. We attempted to use Authorize.net to manage transactions, but it was slow to return money to users and we didn't use it. The money in the application, then, is purely virtual.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't find a feasible API to handle money, and there was no time to create our own. We struggled with and learned a lot from Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an application that communicates with a Firebase database in a way that resembles adding and removing funds from a piggy bank.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Android's development environment.
