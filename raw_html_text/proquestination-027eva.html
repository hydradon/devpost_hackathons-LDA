                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't have anything to do, it was just the first good idea to come into my head.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proquestination keeps track of tasks which you put in, and calculates how much you procrastinate compared to other people through how early or late you decided to do assignments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used lots and lots of Javascript and Jquery, Lots of HTML, and some CSS. I also used shiftedit.net as a text editor to code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For one thing, I didn't have a team. This made me have to do a lot more work as well as slowing down progress and making progress come to a complete halt while I was sleeping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The equations which measure how many days you have left to complete an assignment. I can't believe I finished them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always back up your work. ALWAYS. I lost most of my work twice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Proquestination.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bug fixes, lots of bug fixes. Increased complexity of time left equations to include hours. A more refined point system. Possibly other things as well.
                </p>
