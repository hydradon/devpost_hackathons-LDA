                    Through our research, we thought that the impact of accessibility in public transportation was the most meaningful to us. The way that we decided to approach this problem was by creating an interface...TAVI! The Transportation Assistant for the Visually Impaired. The idea was to create something where the user could simply speak into their microphone for information about the transit that they need to take since they are not able to check bus stop numbers and arrival times.
