                            My sister Amily is a middle school student. She is a good student, but she hates reading books. "Game is more charming than studying", she sometimes complains, "I hope to get high scores, so I have to work hard. But...How great it would be if I can play video games with classmates, while still getting a high score on my test!" 
Why not? -- Last week, when she was complaining again, that idea hit my head: Why not! Why not make an educational mobile game? My first thought was similar to Habitatics - more like a todo list, that children's avatars and weapons would get upgraded when they finished their tasks.
After talking with Jump and Tony in a Friday party, we got a more exciting idea: Still make it an educational mobile game, while we should add element of "online battle" to it. Online battle system and reputation system, if well designed, can considerably encourage K-12 children, like Amily, to use it for an interesting way to learn, and to practice exam questions. Jump, Tony and I were all enthusiastic about the idea. We formed a team quickly and started to contribute to this project. A+ Fighter was born in this context.  - Min Chen

                            I recently read an article: some kids, while playing a game, were able to solve a protein folding problem that had been puzzling scientists for years. That research shows that gaming is one way for children to concentrate, and improve problem-solving skills. When I heard about this hackathon, I knew I wanted to do something similar to the protein folding game. One of our team member, Min, proposed to make an app to keep track of personal goals such as losing weight or getting a good grade.  I thought about her idea and it came to me what if people could challenge each other to improve. A game-education app might create a chance for students who did not study well, to restart, and keep interested in learning. That is how A+Fighter was born. - Tony Trieu

                    A+ Fighter is an educational mobile application that helps students in three aspects:

                    <li>
                        Provides a lot of practice exams. And we made it a game, so, students can have fun while they study.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tracks student's progress. We provide summarized information for parents and schools. We want this to help in planning both for individual and group study.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Comes with career path advice. The more the student uses the app, the more effective it is. This app will records all practice test scores in 5 areas: Mathematics, Science, Art, Social Study and English. With this information, we can suggest career path for student.
