                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Did you know that you could save money on a Lyft ride by just walking one block? Well, with Lyft$aver, we find the lowest price in a 3 block radius to you and help you save on that Lyft. All you have to do is input where you are and where you want to go and we will do the rest. Start saving money now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lyft$aver reccomends the cheapest pick up location based on your current location and destination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Google Polymer to build the front end. Our backend was done with the Lyft API to figure out what is the pickup location that save you the most money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time doing a hackathon. There is a learning curve for Google Polymer and connecting the front end to the back end is not as straightforward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made it! We get every part of the web app to work together and we built something that is useful for almost everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Google Polymer which is a great front end library. In addition, we have gained a much deeper understanding of RESTful APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lyft$aver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking into scaling up the project. Our potential exit is to be acquired by either Lyft or Uber to improve their service and algorithm. The idea of recommending cheap pick-up location for users creates a win-win situation for the companies, drivers, and passengers. Passengers save more money, drivers save on gas, and the companies can better coordinate their resources to provide better services.
