                    It is very clear that the people who lead us are either grossly incompetent or negligent in the climate genocide they are shepherding us towards.

                    ```&ldquo;Riot&rdquo; is an unfinished grave that was dug to deposit undepleted anger /

And to make your resistance into an overreaction
