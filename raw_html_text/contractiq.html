                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are more than 2-3 million deployed smart contracts on the Ethereum network but there isn't an easy &amp; consistent way to get real-time traffic insights for these smart contracts. Developers often have to implement their own analytics dashboards and alerting systems to monitor the smart contract execution. We have built a generic way to take care of this pain point for the smart contract developers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ContractIQ consists of -
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        UI Dashboards for contract execution analytics
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        APIs to subscribe to contract events and get notified
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We can slice and dice to get real-time information about all functions and events for any deployed smart contract and look at all this in dashboards. With ContractIQ it is possible to answer questions like below easily -
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        What was the maximum sale price of the crypto kitty sold in the last hour?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How many loans were originated from Compound smart contract in the last 7 days?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How many SiringAuctionSale events occurred yesterday?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We monitor each and every confirmed block on the network and record contract transactions. We match these with the smart contract interface definition (abi) and record the values in a generic way in the datastore. We then provide APIs and UI dashboards to slice and dice this data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Parsing and decoding input and data blocks from transactions and transaction receipts wasn't as easy as we thought it would be. Libraries like ethereumj &amp; web3j came in handy for this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developing this to be a generic framework so that this platform could work for any smart contract given its abi json was certainly challenging
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designing this in a way that it can scale horizontally when Ethereum scales from 1 Million transactions per day to 10 Million per day or more took longer than expected time
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>

                    <li>
                        We have our UI and APIs ready and deployed which we think can be production ready in around a month to 2 months worth of time.
