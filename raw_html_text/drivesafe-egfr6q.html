                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every year in America there are 1.6 million car crashes. 1 out of 4 of those are related to texting while driving. People nowadays can't resist the urge to know who texted them, what they texted them, and the reply back. Well, we have created a mobile app that can do just that and also keep you safe!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DriveSafe is an app that will reply to all texts and phone calls with a customizable automated text message an will read out loud the sender and the message, so there is no need to look at your phone while driving.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MIT App Inventor to create this Android app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into were that MIT App Inventor ran slow, decreasing our programming efficiency, along with a lot of debugging. A LOT of debugging.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have helped to create a solution to a major problem that claims so many lives every year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the creation of DriveSafe, we learned block-based programming, which was foreign to many of us in the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DriveSafe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our plans for DriveSafe include opening it up to the Google Play Store, along with porting it over to iOS.
