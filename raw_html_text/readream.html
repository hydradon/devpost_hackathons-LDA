                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nightmares sparked our initial interest in attempting to understand the underlying causes of dreams. To make a long story short, we could not come up with a clear-cut definition. However, we did learn that when we share dreams with our friends (or vice versa), our dreams (or theirs) became an open-ended story with multiple insights, analyses, and meanings.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    It allows you to share your dreams as well as give insights to other users' dreams.
