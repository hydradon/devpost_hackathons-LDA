                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of five female coders, we have often been faced with the reality that we are an underrerepresented minority in the field of Computer Science. Thus, we came up with this idea to connect women to other women who want to learn the same skills as them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows users to create profiles and in this process, choose what skill(s) they want to learn. Our app then connects them to other women who have the same interests, and it allows them to chat on a secure platform as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to develop an Android application using Java, which implements Firebase. We also used a cloud-based chat API called scaledrone to enable users to chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating Firebase into the app, designing the user interface, and making the different parts cohesive are challenges we ran into and overcame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud for coming up with this complete product with less than ten hours of time spent actually coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Firebase and implement it in an application for the first time, use the scaledrone API, and implement design thinking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FemGeek
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to create a more comprehensive rewarding system, where users will receive discount coupons. Additionally, we would like to add an option for recruiters to look for potential hires on this app.
