Right from the get-go, we had the roadblock of setting up our virtual environment to be compatible with all four of our APIs, which included installing the GCloud SDK, editing our System Path variables, and ensuring proper definition of key/token access. The Google Cloud Platform is powerful but maintains a steep learning curve that takes no shame in punishing those new to the craft of software engineering. The use of different IDEs and unstable Internet access only added to the pressure and stress as debugging became increasingly more difficult and time slipped away.

                    In all honesty, there's a lot our team is proud about here at LAHacks! One of our mates was a first-time hacker and did an

                    job integrating the intimidating Google Cloud APIs, while for another three of us it was the first completed project at a hackathon! We are all still apprentices in this craft, with so much to learn and explore, but we traversed astounding ground over the past few days and take great pride in sticking with our project until completion. At first, our

                    was an evasive mystery with so many confounding components, but we constantly built on and built up each other, sharing our knowledge and making up for each other's weaknesses. We stepped way out of our comfort zones and implemented tools we had never seen nor used before, like Flask, GCP, and Django. Solis was a pretty big team, but we fit together like pieces of a puzzle.

                    Perseverance. Grit. Patience. Teamwork. All are clique, but beautiful descriptions of what Solis cultivated working on

                    as we powered through 3 days of blood, sweat, and lots of Chipotle burritos. We became more confident as the knowledge we gained strengthened our foundation, and we realized the capacity to apply in
                    <em>
                        Jotes!

                    what we gained in workshops. Quite a rush, I must say! One of the most potent lessons we learned was how to properly balance our work and our sleep (I say as I write this at 5 am lol) as it gave us an edge as the days grew dim, the shadows grew long, and the sweet embrace of slumber began to claim our fellow hackers.

                    Interestingly enough, the future of
                    <em>

                    is already very clearly defined. One of our mates spent a huge chunk of time working on a fully featured, functionally rich upgrade of the current build, but wasn't able to complete the re-integration in time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second build would have added user authentication and blog functionality, so that users could publicly post and share lecture transcripts for others to enrich their studying with, as well as privately save their own personal
                    <em>
                        jotes
                    </em>
                    . The public posts would allow for users to provide their own
                    <em>
                        jotes
                    </em>
                    to help inform others. Current functionality is the aforementioned user authentication, secure registration, ability to modify, update, and delete posts, static data stored in a SQL database, profile images, restriction of edit privileges to only the logged in user's own posts, conglomerated posts by the original poster, tabbing, and a powerful admin tool to modify all settings and data associated with the SQL database.

                    definitely has a promising future, with an already growing feature set, and the passion from Solis brightening any study session. It is deployment ready, and development will always be driven by a determination to correct the inequities that pervade our societies and institutions so completely; to provide more equal opportunity where there may not be. Just take a look!
