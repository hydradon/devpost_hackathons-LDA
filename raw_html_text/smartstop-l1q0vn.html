                    Sixt challenge inspired us to think about consequences of fully-automated driving.

                    What if an open source and open hardware nonprofit crowdfunding project was started for building cars that drive people around as a taxi, have cryptocurrencies at their disposal and buy new cars by themselves?
There is no head organization owning the cars. The cars own themselves according to the rules of blockchain with smart contracts. They save money for themselves for smart-maintenance repairs and buying new "smart nodes" meaning new cars, loading their cloud-based software on them. So the "free cars" would grow exponentially without any owner.

                    We discussed if its possible or not and how this could work in the bigger picture, and we came to some very frightening results.

                    This is an philosophical matter, and we spend much time on discussing it. But the main message is: "Be careful with buzzwords and artificial intelligence".
