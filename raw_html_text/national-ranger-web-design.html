                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We researched and dug deep into the daily lives of National Forest Rangers, evaluating their day to day jobs as well as rare requirements. This inspired us to create an aesthetically pleasing, easy and quick to use and wholesome website and mobile app for the Rangers to be able to conduct their responsibilities on an interface which reflects their love for nature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interface has a live and interactive map which displays the latest emergencies and activities occurring within the national park. In addition, it provides a wholesome and easy to use scheduling system for rangers to not only schedule in their work but also book any equipment that may be required during the event. Furthermore, the interface has a running inventory of the animals, plants and the environment, providing latest data about the park as well as any general information a Ranger might find helpful to know for themselves or Additionally, the website has an exclusive eLearning center with training videos for new rangers and knowledgeable videos for all rangers.  Finally, as it is an employee website, there are also personal performance reviews for a ranger to view and assess.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first drafted the specification for the design, based upon which we sketched out various ideas for each page relating to content. We displayed this in technical drawing through our wireframes, which further allowed us to build a logical and comprehensive user flow. Incorporating all of this work we finally built mockups to bring our idea to life and represent the aesthetics we wish to incorporate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was not only difficult to find information on Nature Rangers and their managerial activies, but It also proved difficult to find the best softwares to create our mockups and wireframs. Thus time was our greatest challenge.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite all the hurdles we went through, we have created a user interface we are proud of with detailed wireframes, logical user flow and aesthetic mockups.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is important to prioritize the work and spend less time on low risk parts of the project.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make them user friendly, modern, comprehensive (filled with information) and most importantly live updates and interactive maps.
