                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Previous members from my team have partaken in the State Farm challenge previously at different hackathons and really liked and appreciated the way they do their challenges and so we wanted to do it again because we had such a good experience last time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It builds onto the already existing State Farm app to help speed up and optimize the process along with analyzing the system of filing claims with insurance in a shorter period of time. In adition, we are creating a rewards system in which the environmentally aware State Farm customers are, we will in return donate to a charity of their choosing since they are using either less electricity, gas, or producing less waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created a mock up prototype of the app that shows how our design can be implemented and work in theory.

                    Creating a functional prototype of our app. Coming up with new, creative ideas that we believe have real potentional to be implemented in the real life.
