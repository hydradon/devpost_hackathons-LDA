                    Main Pitch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is made for volunteers who want to action in their community by allowing certain agencies to access our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Objective
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In using their information for agencies, the agencies will assign volunteer assignments. Each assignment is identified by a company id. This allows agencies to access the social volunteer network while using our Google Maps API to pair them up with assignments close to the volunteer&rsquo;s location or hometown. Assigning tasks to volunteers will help with time efficiency and urgency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Processing the Data
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keywords identify the objective on each volunteer assignment. Agencies are assigned to industries. Agencies pitch their goals and objectives to the project creators, on how volunteers can help their community.
