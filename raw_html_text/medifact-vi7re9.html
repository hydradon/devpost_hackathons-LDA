                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polypharmacy is the study of the effects of consuming multiple medications and drugs. At this time, 45.1% of all Americans are taking one or more medications.  With each new medication, the possibility of negative interactions between the drugs increases.  Current clinical trials does not take into account all the medications a person can consume.  Medifact aims to remedy this by giving the power to the user to check if their combination of medications is statistically safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Medifact takes into consideration the statistical probability of having an untoward reaction to a single medication and takes the statistical probability of the combination of medications and checks if the prescribed medication combination can make you ill. If it does, Medifact recommends you see your doctor and consider switching prescriptions.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we came up with an algorithm for deciding how dangerous each combination of drugs will be based on the  reported untoward occurrences. After we finished the front-end with Jade, we worked on implementing the algorithm onto the Node.js server with MongoDB. We then deployed it to Amazon Web Service EC2 and linked it to our domain sponsored by domain.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data of untoward effects of medications on a population, interactions of medications that do not affect the same pathway, and the ratio of medications prescribed is not public.  We had to extrapolate data from the information provided on the Internet about the untoward effects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact we are able to segment and analyze the effects of the medication on the population and we wrote a simple, well-defined algorithm that should be flexible enough to implement with real data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm needs to be fine-tuned a bit to take into account that these medication reactions are not happening on the same pathway. Along with developing the application for statistical analysis, we learned how to utilize a server and launch the application on the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Medifact
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to integrate real medication data, fine tune the algorithm, take into account medication ratios, analyze known drug interactions and extrapolate possible medication interactions, and continue to improve the user experience.
