                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When Pokemon Go came out, I wanted to create an app using the public PokeApe to give people more information about pokemon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to input the PokeDex ID number of the Pokemon whose information you want. Then, you press a PokeBall button, and the name of the pokemon, it's height, and its weight show up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Swift, Xcode, the PokeApi, and PokemonKit to build the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was my first time using an API. My challenges included learning how to decipher information provided by the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I was able to access data from a database online and successfully add it to my project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use a RESTful API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PokeSearch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, I would like for the app to display a picture of the Pokemon. Also, I would like it to provide even more information. The API provides a lot of information.
