                    Allows a user to sign up and log in and go to a dashboard. Here they can choose employment, community, or resources to view related data. There is a drop down select for which language you would want.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by discussing what the base of the application would need.  From there we immediately got started on building what we have discussed.  We each took our individual roles and started in, one on building the api, one on starting the front end and the other to set up accounts and work as a middle man. While we build the base app we took moments in between to discuss the overall direction of the application.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with project setup and basic debugging issues. Trying to come up with an original idea that's not already been done is also not easy.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Not giving up when faced with such a short time span.
