                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to be able to create something that would actually be useful to the people we live with as well as the wider community. One of the problems the council tackled was ensuring residents and students could find a street-lit route home, but was only able to create a static map of the centre of Durham City. Aiming to improve on this idea, we took it upon ourselves to create an app that would provide an interactive map and route finder, preferring safer, lit routes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app will find the safest route, as dictated by whether or not it has street lamps on it, and directs the user along it. If you go away from the path, it will redirect you towards the path. If two people, who have similar starting points and the same destination, send them a question to see if they would like to return together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use Typescript in order to create the app; Google Android API is used in order to get the map data in order to display Google Maps onto the app. Node.js and Firebase are used in order to create a functioning server to deal with multiple users and to communicate between users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially had server problems, being unable to emulate how the Google Maps API works in browser on a server. The number of street-lights in County Durham, around 83,000, meant using the dataset took a significant amount of time at first, in order to optimise.

                    <li>
                        We learnt how poorly we function as individuals on low sleep
