                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges described at the early stage of the event were a great inspiration for helping us build something important at this Hackathon. The base idea behind the creation of IRVA (Image Recognition and Vocal Aid) which is helping challenged people made it something more than just a computer science project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I.R.V.A is a simple yet powerful Image to Text AI. It can detect images and carefully analyze important data to provide an accurate representation of the image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built IRVA using the Node.js framework to build the majority of the front end. Electron and React were used to build and build the back end. We used CloudSpit API to integrate the image recognition AI to the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had adversities in integrating the image detection and processing from the server to the index file. Other than that some of the JavaScript and CSS did not correctly appear the way we wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally had in mind to only have an image recognition type application. Our teammates pushed the boundaries to achieve something spectacular, Image to recognition and to speak out the image that was recognized by the AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All team members got a chance to work with React and JavaScript. We were able to see how powerful react was and understand to use how to use CloudSpits API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for IRVA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, IRVA is only a desktop application. We believe we can reach a greater amount individuals on the mobile platforms and plan to expand IRVA towards iOS and Android.
