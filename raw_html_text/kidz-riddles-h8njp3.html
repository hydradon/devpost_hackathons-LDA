                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My kids love riddles, we sit at the dinner table most nights asking each other riddles to see who can guess the answer. It's one of the categories my 6, 10 and 13 year old kids can all discuss and solve
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill asks you easy, medium or hard riddles, and then you can give your answer and get 1,2 or 3 points. You can have multiple people in your family each answer the riddles.
You ask it things like:
Me: Open Kidz Riddles
Me: Tell me a riddle (you can quit and return to the riddle)
Me: The answer is 5 elephants
Me: My name is Jamie (you can pick any name which is valid until someone changes it)
Me: How many points do I have?
Me: Tell me an easy, medium or hard riddle
Me: Remove all my data (purges all data on the database)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was originally built on AWS, but due to costs, it was moved to private VPS hosting.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voice was new to me, so the testing was a challenge. At present I only have Postman API automated testing
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just having a skill submitted on my own, after my team members pulled out is something I have enjoyed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voice design is critical, and with the help of my kids, I've made it more kid-friendly (though there's more to do!) using their "lingo" and logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for kidz riddles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've almost finished building a player-by-turn game, but that wasn't ready. So now it only supports individual riddles for one player at a time.
