                    Our Simple but Great Idea: Eliminating time searching for available tables/cubicles at libraries.
                </h1>

                    The Problem
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Being students our team can relate to the struggles of having to find a quiet and available study space. Many students on campus prefer to go to libraries where there are quiet zones provided, however when exams kick in people spend days at the library. Tables become crowded and people start to search every floor to find one available seat, but this takes time. Especially, when students study at libraries for days the amount of time is accumulated and could have been used for studying and further preparing for exams. Usually, there isn&rsquo;t a lot of time to study for multiples consecutive finals so any extra time a student could gain is very beneficial.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Execution Plan
                </h1>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Our program is an availability tracker and a room booking app. We plan to create a system in libraries where students can login their student ID whenever they are seated at a table. Making this program in real time, it continually takes those logins to signal that a specific seat in the library is occupied. When an individual leaves, they must sign out so that the program can know when to record that the seat is now available. 
There is no time limit as to how long a person can spend at this space, but the program is also able to book these study spaces. This concept of booking cubicles will create an incentive for students to use our program because it would prevent them from being kicked out of their space. Our program is similar to an availability tracker/booking system, but instead implemented at tables and cubicles. We want to effectively minimize the time wasted searching for study spaces.

                        Side Note
                    </strong>
                    Unfortunately, as beginner programmers with little to none experience we were unable to create a working and complete program for our idea. We played around with some programs and googled some codes that would be helpful in creating our system and this is as far as we got.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Program
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Below is a sample code on R from
                    <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/simple-user-interface-in-r-to-get-login-details/" rel="nofollow">
                        https://www.r-bloggers.com/simple-user-interface-in-r-to-get-login-details/
                    </a>
                    where we hope to have a login prompt the user for their student ID and password. This will be what the user will see initially when seating at an empty table. You can plug this code into R.
