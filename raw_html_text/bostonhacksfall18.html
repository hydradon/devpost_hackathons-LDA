                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from personal experiences. One of our members had a family member suffering from Alzheimer's and understands personally the traumatizing effects it has on a family.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a virtual reminder system which provides a personalized experience. We provide a personalized experience for the user by having voices of their loved ones. It has been proven that familial voices help dementia patients maintain communication with their family. It slows the aging process of dementia.

                <h2>
                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We built it using the Bose SoundTouch Audio Notification API and Google Calendar API. We built the website using HTML and CSS.
