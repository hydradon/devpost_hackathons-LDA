                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us have been trying to start working out more as a new-year resolution and found that we needed a way to keep track of what we have been doing during a gym session. This need, as well as a desire to dip our toes into Android app development, spurred us to make our own Gymspiration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gymspiration is an Android application that keeps records of all the different exercises you can do at the gym. This information includes the number of sets / reps and the last recorded weight you performed the exercise at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app through Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us were unfamiliar with Android Studio and how to code an application in general, so there was a significant amount of overhead for both of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It runs!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That app development is a lot harder than we initially anticipated, but at the same time just as rewarding as we thought when something compiled correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gymspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving forward, we plan to implement adding new exercises as workout plans change and also grouping exercises together into 'days' for easier checking in the gym.
