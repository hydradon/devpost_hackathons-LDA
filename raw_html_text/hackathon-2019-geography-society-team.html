                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using GIS, our team wanted to visualize available public data in a spatial format. With background processing ran on Feature Manipulation Engine (FME) and an online platform called ArcGIS Online (an enterprise solution by ESRI), we created 2 web map applications to better citizen's experience in College Station and surrounding region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first web application:
                    <strong>
                        The Charities Web Application
                    </strong>
                    :
                </p>
                <p>
                    This application shows all available charities in College Station (as recorded by the Bryan Chamber of Commerce). This map also includes layers for visualizing the food deserts of College Station using the grocery store data. With this, the buffers show areas where feasibly traveling to a grocery store is hindered without proper transportation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second web application:
                    <strong>
                        Adopt A Bike Lane
                    </strong>
                    :
                </p>
                <p>
                    This application shows all bike lanes in the city, all potential bike lanes, and bike racks. The application also shows all reported events by users. Additionally, if you click on a bicycle lane, it will take you to an form to apply for a adopting a bike lane to keep our city beautiful.
                </p>
