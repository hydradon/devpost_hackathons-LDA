                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind this project was to build a portable device that has the capability to track and fend off any malicious threat on each street. As cyber crime is on the rise and it is affecting almost everyone, we wanted to build a system that can ensure security on the network at all times.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a portable Honeypot and Intrusion Detection System Software embedded on Rasberry Pi to track the source of cyber threats through data analysis techniques. The hacker's activity can be tracked using Snort and Kippo. If he tires to login or run any commands on the target machine, it will be logged and tracked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Rasberry Pi module, Snort, Kippo Honeypot and KippoGraph.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to create a circuit and make it work on the network. 
The implementation of the honeypot was a little challenging.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked very hard and were successfully able to track down a hacker's activity from trying to hack into the system using brute-force or gaining shell and accessing command. We were able to track each and every command entered by the hacker.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how a honeypot can be created and implemented.
We learnt how an IDS works.
We learnt how embedded technology can be used to make our network more secure.

                    What's next for StreetSecure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would improve the Realtime Data Visualization and setup a monitoring and logging dashboard to view the status of each of the target nodes in realtime.
