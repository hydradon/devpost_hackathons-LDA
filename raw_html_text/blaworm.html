                <p>
                    Our motivation is related to our desire to learn and meet people from other countries and have good moments

                <p>
                    Our project is a platform game in 2.5D with different game modes, the most developed are the infinite mode and the level selector.
Our project has a store of its own in which from a system of collecting coins you can buy new appearances of the main character, colors to change during the game and improvements.
Dynamic menus and camera movements that will take you into a world of impressive mazes.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project was divided into sectors and each member of the group was commissioned to make a section of the project, one ordered the infinite mode and the character, another of the menus and some levels; And the other member performed levels and creative part.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges that this game has, is the infinite mode and the creation of this, since we have to take into account the progressive level destruction for not over loading memory and device ram.
Another point of difficulty to take into account is the creation of the character and the movement of this post that has to follow some parameters and receive information the input devices of each device in which it is executed
                </p>

                    We are proud to have made the infinite mode given that it has been one of the greatest challenges
