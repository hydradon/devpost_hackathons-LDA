                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More and more people are turning the backs to offline shopping. But we wanna bring the people back in the shops by combining offline shopping with online shopping using our app
                    <strong>
                        ShopBrowser
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore we got inspired by the challenge and the beautiful poem of
                    <strong>
                        creuna
                    </strong>

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like in Tinder you can favor amazing clothing at any time where you want. 
When you are in the shop you get notifications when your favorized items in your size are available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using
                    <strong>
                        Augmented Reality
                    </strong>
                    you gain a
                    <strong>
                        shopping experience on a new level
                    </strong>
                    .
Animations will appear at the shelfs where your desired items are and by
                    <strong>
                        interacting
                    </strong>
                    with it you can see more details. If you like the clothing, ShopBrowser suggests you items matching to it and navigates you to its position.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we handsketched our app and afterwards we visualized it with the program Principle. Watch our result here
                    <a href="https://vimeo.com/211160909" rel="nofollow">
                        link
                    </a>
                    ;)
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built an application as well with Android Studio. To realize the AR the shelves of the shop are equipped with bluetooth devices which get connected to the application on the phone. The bluetoothsignals send information where the favorized clothing items are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never used AR before and also the concept with Beacons/Bluetooth Signals in spatiality was new for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of

                    losing in Lasertag

                    <li>
                        using Android Studio and that Android Studio is bad for working together on a project
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        sucking at creating an app but still having fun

                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ShopBrowser
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ShopBrowser could be linked to instagram, so that users could upload pictures how they are wearing the clothes. That leads to a
                    <strong>
                        social proof
                    </strong>
                    and shows that the clothing are not just made for models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be nice to realize also an area for
                    <strong>
                        reviews
                    </strong>
                    from shoppers in the detail view of a clothing item and a question area like in Amazon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore we liked to do
                    <strong>
                        AI based product recommendations
                    </strong>
                    by analyzing the TinderForClothing-behavior of the user so that we figure out what the style of the user is and we can provide
                    <strong>
                        personalized suggestions
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Gamification
                    </strong>
                    would be an interesting field as well. You can collect points by finding the matching items of your favorized items in the shop. That would motivate the user to look around more in the shop and inspire him/her to buy more. With enough points you get discounts for your next purchase or gifts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be possible as well to use the app as a
                    <strong>
                        payback-card
                    </strong>
                    /collector card. Every time you buy something, you collect points as well. With that concept we can create a
                    <strong>
                        purchase history
                    </strong>
                    of every user and improve the AI based product recommendations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application field could be also
                    <strong>
                        extended
                    </strong>
                    to other shopping items f.e. toys, beauty products, ITproducts and more.
