                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My dogs are the inspiration of this skill. Me as a dog owner want to keep my dogs well taken care when I am away from home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill helps the dog sitter or the person that is taking care of your dog to have all the info that you know about your dogs. He just has to ask alexa how to do things for your dog and It will respond with the info that the owner previously set up in the skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Javascript to create a Lambda function hosted in AWS to fulfill the alexa intents. Also, I created a DynamoDB table to store the info about the dogs.
