                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Health and wellness are very important to both of us. We knew we wanted to create something to make a positive impact in these areas and we both love hiking in Santa Barbara. Although information about trails can be found scattered throughout the Internet, we wanted to put all of the information about hiking in Santa Barbara in one convenient place. We wanted to work with Android app development and decided to make an app that could be hiking companion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app displays descriptions about several trails in Santa Barbara along with their maps and photos. We also have a section to handle common inquiries, covering topics from wildlife to first aid. Notably, our app also has safety features, such as an emergency alert button that can be pressed if a hiker needs help while on the trail alone without phone service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this awesome app piece by piece, working on the individual trail pages, creating menu displays, and figuring out how to import audio. We started with a basic template from the options given by Android Studio. Sophia had no prior exposure to mobile app development and Heather had some, so we spent a lot of time learning, making mistakes, and growing in knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble dealing with different versions of Android studio and package names. We also had trouble controlling the logic of the alert button. Time was also a challenge, and neither of us previously have worked under such constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working product that we created in a short period of time. We ended up creating more than we originally thought possible and were able to persevere through our challenges mentioned above. We are proud that it was created by strong, beautiful women.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned and improved upon our skills with Android Studio and Java. We learned to collaborate as a pair, despite our differences in approach to programming and our working habits. We improved our ability to use git well throughout the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SBTrax
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add more trails, interactive maps, have emergency flashlight, community profiles/posts, create database and allow users to perform custom searches.
