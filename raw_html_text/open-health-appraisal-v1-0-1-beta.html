                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Performance appraisal is an integral part for any Enterprise and its employees.
                    </strong>
                    Through appraisal system, an employee gets continual feedback from manager. Based on that, employee can identify the areas of strengths and weeknesses. This helps the employee to stay focused and motivated and the organization gets more productivity from employees.
Our HealthApprialsal V1.0.0 system helps the employee to stay focused on their health and lifestyle also by bringing a complete module and workflow by integrating the health check in their appraisal system. This app will ensure that an organization can motivate it's employees by pushing towards healthy lifestyle goal selections and providing feedback on their performance. Healthy employees will in turn boost the productivity of the organization at a large scale and thus increasing the level of employee satisfaction as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application we developed is for ** ACME organization ** where John Meyer is the Manager who has a team of five people (namely) reporting to him. Apart from normal appraisal system to validate the performance of the team, John can push all his team members to follow healthy Goals and stay active.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Use Case 1: Manager John Meyer Creates Goals for employee
                    </strong>
                    In the application, John after login, can create various goals under three fixed categories like
                    <strong>
                        "LifeStyle"
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        "Eating"
                    </strong>
                    &amp;
                    <strong>
                        "Fitness"
                    </strong>
                    . He can also add upto maximum of 3 checkpoints for any goal to measure the teammember who will be enrolling it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Use Case 2: Employee selects the Goal
                    </strong>
                    From the employee perspective, they can login to the system and in the 'View All Goals' section they can enrol to a Goal which he/she would like to participate. Once enrolled, the Goal would appear in the 'My Goals' section for the employee. The day employee enrols to the goal, becomes the start day for the goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Use Case 3: Employee fills up the enrolled goal
                    </strong>
                    Once employee is enrolled to the goal, they can try to meet the expectation set either in the checkpoints or in the description of the goal. Once they think they have achieved the goal they can submit the goals for review by the manager with their comments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Use Case 4: Manager reviews the submitted Goal by employee
                    </strong>
                    Once employee submits a Goal for review, that would appear in Manager's dashboard under "review submitted goals" section where manager can view employee comments as well as the checkpoints. He can then put his own comments and also give score out of 10 and mark the appraisal as completed. Once manager submits, the completed appraisal system is available in the employee dashboard "View completed goals" section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Use Case 5: Gamification
                    </strong>
                    Both manager &amp; employee dashboard has "leaderboard" section which shows the entire team stats. This would boost gamification among team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We completely developed the application using Java runtime and Spring MVC engine for Wildfly server. The wildfly image has been installed for the docker container and using Eclipse the entire deployment has been handled. The entire application can be pushed to github from Eclipse. Once Github is refrehsed with committed changes, from the OpenShift console we initiate new build for deployment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never worked in any kind of Docker container managed cloud environment before. This is first time we worked. So we learned many things while starting to develop app. During our journey we faced challenges on developing Java based application in docker container and also we didn't want to use any command line tools. We thought we couldn't develop application as we are totally new to the system. However thanks to the prompt support and available docs we were finally able to make it work and that too in our way which we are comfortable with. OpenShift cloud console is so easy to understand that after following docs and getting answers from the Stackoverflow channels we could develop the prototype app within just 3 weeks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Conceptualizing and having a prototype of the app running in OpenShift Hackathon space is a biggest accomplishment for us. We are proud that we are able to put the workflow we thought of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Of course OpenShift environment and docker container. This is really a new learning curve for us and we really liked working with it.
