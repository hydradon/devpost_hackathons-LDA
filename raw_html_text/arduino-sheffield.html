                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a late start we missed out on all the goodies dropped by the sponsors so decided to have a crack at learning something. With all of us knowing different languages we decided to implement an Arduino, Python and Java stack (all native) allowing control of an Arduino sled-bot we would scrap together from dominoes pizza boxes and mint tin lids.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keyboard controlled movement whilst tethered to a laptop
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With much difficulty, some duct tape and no sleep. Build process was iterative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mistakenly connected an ESP01 to logical 5v and blew it a few hours in and had a hard time configuring python libraries for the second one, so we fell back on hard tethering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone stayed the 24 hours!! Great team spirit in face of adversity and bytecode
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to write in Arduino (much easier than we thought).
How to wire circuits wrong, and sometimes right.
