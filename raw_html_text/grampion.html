                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With so much push for technology, there was the risk of losing the human factor. This is already a concern for the elderly population because of isolation and loneliness. We wanted to try our hands at creating something with both a technology and human factor.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea is Grampion. Grampion provides human interaction with a dedicated, professional Grampion and loved ones through simple, easy to use voice, video, and device-based interfaces.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Grampion by designing a website using HTML. After designing the website, we used a program called PhoneGap to begin constructing a mobile version of our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into quite a bit of challenges. Our first ideas that we had came up with had been taken, or would have just been a slight tweak to already existing products. Once we came up with the idea of Grampion, the next challenge was how to make a website. After we had made the website, we had trouble with uploading videos onto the computer and onto the website. The last major challenge was making a mobile version of the website.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest accomplishment that we had throughout this time was the knowledge we gained. Our group was able to learn the basics about making a website and turning that into an app. Also, we are proud of the fact that there was major contributions from each team member. The last major accomplishment was creating something that was both human and technology based.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major thing we learned was that simplicity is key. We also learned how to share and combine ideas. We learned how to use a new program in order to make our website into a mobile app. We learned new code for the website in HTML. We learned how to upload videos onto our website in HTML.
                </p>
