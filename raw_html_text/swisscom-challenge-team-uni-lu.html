                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got inspired by the presentation of the challenge by Swisscom employees. For us it was clear that this could be really helpful in order to help small businesses compete with big players like amazon and so on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simplifies mobile payments for an easy and agreeable experience which helps users pay with their mobile phone also on small business websites which do not have all the data needed to allow fast checkout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the challenge was to build a fast checkout, we decided to go for a freely available template such that we could completely focus on the possibilities that are offered by the Swisscom API and show that we are able to produce a viable solution in a short period of time.
