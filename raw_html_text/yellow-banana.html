                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this app from a game that my children and I like to play whenever we take a car ride. It's friendly competition that's fun for the entire family.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app itself is basically a score keeper and is customizable to keep track of the players by name. The game is entertaining because it gets the entire vehicle involved and communicating with one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How to play
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you spot a yellow vehicle, yell out &ldquo;Yellow Banana!&rdquo; The first player to collect 10 yellow bananas wins the game. Yellow motorcycles are worth 5 points, as are yellow slug bugs (Volkswagen Beetles) and yellow boats. If you happen to see a yellow airplane or helicopter, you get 10 points, giving you an automatic win!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I drew all of the components in adobe illustrator, and did some editing in adobe photoshop. Once I had the design complete, I imported them all into Xcode. I created an animation as an intro and used several different animation types to create a clean interface that is not overwhelming and complicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything that I had done was pretty much new to me so the entire project was sort of a challenge. The one thing that annoyed me the most was getting the animated pieces to return to the proper locations and keep the design uniform for different devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm most proud that my children love and play the game. They are always excited about car trips because of it. Not just MY children, but my nieces, nephews and friends of my children get excited and talk to me about it every time they see me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Yellow Banana
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully the game will gain popularity and become fun for many others. I have also toyed with the idea of making it interactive through mobile to mobile and/or even as an iMessage game.
