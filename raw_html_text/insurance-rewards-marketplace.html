                    Insurance Rewards Marketplace, the market place where insurance companies will invest in their customers and customers will pay them back by staying healthy, this makes customers earn majority of incentives with some minimal coaching type of wellness incentives upfront. It is a voluntary marketplace where you can participate once you purchase health insurance. Having a health insurance policy is mandatory to participate in this platform. The idea behind this is to create tailor made goals for individuals based on their overall health condition and incentivize them to achieve their goals. This platform will be automated through a combination of &ldquo;Smart Contract &amp; Blockchain&rdquo; technology. An Ethereum based smart contract will execute once a particular threshold is met and will trigger incentives specified in the contract by crediting health points. Health points can be earned by submitting evidences through their smart watches or by scanning receipts (E.g. Yoga class receipts, Counselling receipts, meditation class receipts&hellip;&hellip;.)
 If the customer completes the specific goal selected through this platform for a defined period, he / she is eligible for the complete reward which will be credited to the customers wallet.

                    This platform also has activity goals tied to your passion like dancing, biking, hiking. Etc
