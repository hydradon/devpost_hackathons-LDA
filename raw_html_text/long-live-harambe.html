                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Inspired by the death of Harambe, we set out to keep the memory and legacy of Harambe alive. We thought this is best shown by showing there is a bit of Harambe in everyone
                    </em>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is fairly simple. The app takes an image of Harambe and posts it over a face it detects on a webcam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using OpenCV and Python, we created a method to track the faces in appearing in the webcam. From this, we take the image and apply the 'Harambe filter' over the faces identified in the webcam
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every project comes with a challenge, and this definitely incorporated many challenges. First the frame rate was a challenge to overcome as the application appeared to lag behind real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of getting working computer vision and face tracking working .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned several concepts in Python, with many of the team members not knowing how to code or with minimal experience in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Long Live Harambe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we will be adding multiple Harambe filters that will change on the type of facial recognition the software uses. Also there will be a manual mode to change the filter.
