                    Have you seen a film called Big Hero 6? Or what about Avengers 3: Infinity War? These films feature the use of countless tiny robots to create anything their owner can imagine. The ability to create anything they want, at any time. Seeing this in the fictional world inspired us to see how close we could come in the real world.
                    <br>
                    Our hackathon project uses the Unity game engine to simulate a swarm of nanobots in a 3D environment. Using the built-in 3D model library, we can tell the nanobots to form any object in the system. With the help of modeling programs like Solidworks or Autodesk Inventor we can tell them to make virtually anything we can design ourselves.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is built entirely from the Unity game engine, utilizing the C# programming language.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did encounter some unexpected movement patterns, but through consistent experimentation we were able to figure out solutions for each bug.
