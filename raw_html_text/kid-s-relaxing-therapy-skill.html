                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill was built using Amazon Skills Kit - configuring the intents and utterances, AWS lambda was used to code the business logic, DynamoDB the famous Amazon No-SQL data store was used to store user state as well as dynamically configure the therapy activities and their sequencing within the skill. Amazon S3 was used to store all the audio files, these could be updated on the fly as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    (1) We used the world Alexa in the audio and realized that Alexa was listening to itself!
(2) Storing the session attributes from one call to the next was a challenge and we overcame that by trial and error.
                </p>
