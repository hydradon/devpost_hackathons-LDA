                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently in Bogota, the city where we live, approximately six thousand two hundred tons of waste is buried in the garbage dump of which 40 percent are recyclable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Losing a billion Colombian pesos, which is the commercial value of recycling, thousands of families live from this business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we were more aware of this problem, we would help the environment and the families that dedicate themselves daily to this work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A filter that shows which materials go in each bag, which objects are recyclable and which are not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Spark to create the, filter through an image traker, Blender to create 3d objects and animations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The creation of an fbx that will work 100% well. It was complicated pro sometimes did not export well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the challenge, it was difficult to take time for things from work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More on how to develop filters for Facebook, we think they work for instagram but on that platform it is not compatible with the image tracker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for recyfilter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    hat people use it and that we generate a true conscience, show that there is beyond recycling, the help to the environment and to the families that are dedicated to this work.
