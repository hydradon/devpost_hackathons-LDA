                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it easier for users to complete Interac e-Transfers using popular Google and Amazon voice assistants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes spoken Interac e-Transfer commands and processes them using the public Interac e-Transfer API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created an Action on Google using Dialogflow, created an Alexa skill using AWS.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Encountered issues during Interac API setup and acquiring keys. We were initially unable to perform external API calls from Firebase to Interac, before upgrading our plan.

                    What's next for Interac Home
                </h2>
