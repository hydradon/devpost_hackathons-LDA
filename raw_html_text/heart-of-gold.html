We want to contribute to making the best work environment and culture for all of us workaholics :)

                        IBM Watson IoT API understands the condition and in case of unhealthy heart rate, sends an email to a third party with the information.

                    <li>
                        Each email sent is a "data" block on the blockchain and will be traded for cryptocurrency in future development

                        That condition is taught to the IBM Watson IoT API that tracks the PPG data, and in case of unhealthy heart rate, sends email to a specific person.

                    Add more data to our conditions and therefore the analysis becomes much more trustable and useful.
Connect multiple sensors to tack further data.
Integrate a coinbase API to create transactions between doctor and companies (Data -- Cryptocurrency)
