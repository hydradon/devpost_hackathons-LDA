                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From an Asian background, Our grandparents don&rsquo;t want to be sent to the retirement home. With just mild Alzheimer's, they should be able to stay at home near their loved ones and their community. However, it is normally very difficult to always have a family member besides to take care of them. There would normally a needs to hire a full-time caretaker or a maid to assist them. This causes discomforts as elders people tend not to be comfortable living with a stranger who do everything different. Thus, providing an alternative to a full-time caretakers using technology is more reliable, comfortable and efficient.  # What it does
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask for our web framework with Bootstraps for the frontend. The web app is currently getting mock data from an API hosted on AWS. We also did our mockup of the wearable using Figma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does
The MemoBand: A tracking and notifying app on a wearable worn by the patient that do two jobs: 1. Send notification on the screen and sound to remind Alzheimer patients to do basic daily routines but can be easily forgotten such as eat, sleep, take medications or get hydrated. 2. Track information on their actual daily routines, their sleep circle, diet and medication taking, bathroom schedules, etc. these information will be sent to their family, caretakers, doctors and even nearby police for health care purposeFor Moderate Alzheimer patients, Track if the patients got out of the house, which is potentially very dangerous for Alzheimer's patients without a caretaker. Memo Band will alert near by police.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The web app system: The interface shows caretakers the information as well as input the reminder schedules for the patients.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connect between web server and smartwatch: come across "cross-origin read blocking"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to come up with a solid idea as well as made a good demo in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MemoBand
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Intergrade MemoBand with a SmartHome sensor system, MemoBand can actively track daily activities that can be used for health care reasons such as: Sleeping issues, how many time the patients wake up at night to go to the toilet, how many time the patients drink water a day and able to detect other emergency.
To commercialize MemoBand as a hardware product, because MemoBand will be specialized in shape and size that&rsquo;s comfortable to an elder person&rsquo;s hand for a long period of. Moreover, it will integrated wit special sensors and operating system that only specialized in Alzheimer's treatment, thus making this cheaper than having to buy existing smartwatches products
