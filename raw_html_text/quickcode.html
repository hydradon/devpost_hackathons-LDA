                <p>
                    Software engineering and development have always been subject to change over the years. With new tools, frameworks, and languages being announced every year, it can be challenging for new developers or students to keep up with the new trends the technological industry has to offer. Creativity and project inspiration should not be limited by syntactic and programming knowledge. Quick Code allows ideas to come to life no matter the developer's experience, breaking the coding barrier to entry allowing everyone equal access to express their ideas in code.

                <p>
                    Quick Code allowed users to code simply with high level voice commands. The user can speak in pseudo code and our platform will interpret the audio command and generate the corresponding javascript code snippet in the web-based IDE.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used React for the frontend, and the recorder.js API for the user voice input. We used runkit for the in-browser IDE. We used Python and Microsoft Azure for the backend, we used Microsoft Azure to process user input with the cognitive speech services modules and provide syntactic translation for the frontend&rsquo;s IDE.

It didn't help that this hacakthon was only 24 hours, however, I did it. I did my part on the front-end and I now have another language to add on my resume.

                <p>
                    We plan on continuing development and making this product available on the market. We first hope to include more functionality within Javascript, then extending to support other languages. From here, we want to integrate a group development environment, where users can work on files and projects together (version control). During the hackathon we also planned to have voice recognition to recognize and highlight which user is inputting (speaking) which code.
