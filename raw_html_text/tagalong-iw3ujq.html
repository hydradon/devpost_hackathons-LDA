                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It often happens that when we really want to attend an event and none of our friends are available or interested and we end up sitting at home and missing the event. We decided to build up an application which helps you match up with different people based on your common interest of attending a particular event. Whenever a bunch of people have signed up for an event, their profiles would be displayed to each other and if they "swipe right", they would be matched to a group and can attend the event together.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tag Along is a react-native iOS application which has the vision of bringing people together as a community. The app is based off tinder where instead of going on dates, users can find people with shared interests in attending an event such as concerts, sports games or movies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the mobile application using react-native and javascript in the frontend. While the backend server was built using the Go lang backed by the Postgresql database.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning all of these technologies. Basically, we decided to take up a challenge and use all new technologies to build our project. We spent plenty of time learning react-native, go lang and postgresql database.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Able to finish the application within deadline considering a majority of our time was spent in learning new technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything! We weren't familiar with react-native, go lang or postgresql, hence had to spend the entire night coding, struggling with react-native components and postgresql configurations. Definitely worth it though, it was a great learning experience.
                </p>

                    What's next for tagalong
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sky's the limit, we hope to continue building the application and probably launch it on the AppStore.
