                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've played the game ricochet robots before and thought it would be a cool project to try to replicate-- but with a twist!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a pre-designed game board layout (in the form of a txt file), a player can choose a player character (a dot for example!) They can then choose a starting position and if they want their puzzle to be solved by "Auto" or to figure it out themselves "Inter"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote the code in c++ using the std library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a few challenges with understanding an efficient way to find the solutions to puzzles. I ended up learning a lot about graph search algorithms like BFS and DFS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned a lot about debugging tree.s
                </p>

                    What's next for Ricochet Robots -- Interactive and Auto-solver!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally wanted to integrate a neopixel matrix + Arduino so you could visualize the game better and be better engaged, however, I ran out of time.
