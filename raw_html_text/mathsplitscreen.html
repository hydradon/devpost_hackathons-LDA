                    This program is meant to be an educational app for kids as well as people learning math. This app combines basic mathematical principles as well as a competitive game where people can compete in math against one another. This allows two players to play on the same screen so only one phone is needed. This allows a parent to play with a younger child to enhance the child's mathematical prowess.
