                    Question
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Imagine you have a circle of people and you go around the circle removing every second person until one person is left. If you have 3 people in the circle, then the 3rd person will be the last one remaining. If you have 4 people then the 1st person will be the last one remaining. If you have 11 people then the 7th person will be the one remaining. If you have N people in the circle, who will be the last one remaining? Please formulate your answer as a general solution and not as an algorithm that simulates the problem."

                    Answer
                </p>
                <p>
                    After some hours thinking and testing, we got a solution for the challenge. We will use this nomenclature to declare our math:
N = Number of persons in circle;
U = Last person in circle;
M = Biggest multiple of 2 which is lower then N;
E = Number of persons between N and M;
                </p>
                <p>
                    After many calcules, we catch some things:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last person always will be a odd number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    that always a number of persons is a multiple of 2, the last persons will be 1.
e.g.:   f(2) = 1;
f(4) = 1;
f(8) = 1;
f(16) = 1;
f(32) = 1;
                </p>
                <p>
                    In intervals of multiples of 2, the last person always be added by 2 for each number
of persons in circle. 
e.g:    f(4) = 1;
f(5) = 3;
f(6) = 5;
f(7) = 7;
f(8) = 1
                </p>
                <p>
                    If f(N) is a multiple of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc), so E always be 0, because U will be
value 1. So we have the follow information:
                </p>
                <p>
                    N = M + E;
E = N - M;
M = 2x multiple of 2 there are more closer of N;
U = 2.E + 1;
                </p>
