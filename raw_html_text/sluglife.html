                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's the problem that faces every college student. What do I want to eat? The options are overwhelming, but our wallets are thin, leading us to an obvious choice - on-campus dining. 
We're a group of UCSC students who asked ourselves what we wanted to eat and found no answers. There was no easy way to figure out what to eat on campus. Dining menus and nutritional facts were a hassle to browse through and decipher. Thus, SlugLife was born. 
SlugLife serves to make campus dining a simpler experience.

                    SlugLife is a seamless and sustainable web application that provides UCSC students with real time meal options across various dining halls, cafes, and restaurants on campus. It puts each menu in the palm of your hand, allowing you to filter based on selected allergens, dietary preferences, nutritional information, etc. In addition to clear and concise recipe/ingredient descriptions, SlugLife provides you with vivid, real images of available food options.

                    What makes SlugLife unique is our Food Diary tracker and easy-to-understand nutritional information keys. The food diary allows students to track the nutritional make-up of the foods they've consumed over the course of the day. Dining selection and diet management is made easy through SlugLife.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first scraped the food options off of the UCSC Dining Menu page along with all available nutritional information. We also utilized JS &amp; a HTML/CSS framework for the UI. We used cheerio to parse HTML.
