                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has been a dream of mine to build a simulations for gates with this level of flexibility
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simulates the 7 basic logic gates. each gate can accept 2 inputs(traditional) or more(combining multiple similar gates into one) allowing you to play around and explore digital circuit logic. Each gate has it's own unique ID to help users distinguish between gates when they have too many instances of them to keep track of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C#  and .net framework along with the opensource metroUI library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    keeping graphics smooth due to my lack of knowledge of proper mvc functioning
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building this system which has no limitations but physical memory
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    even though this is a complex system my solution is not intuitive for beginners and i mist find better ways to implement good ui even if i run out of time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Digital Circuit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better ui, more intuitive.
