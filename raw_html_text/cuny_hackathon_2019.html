                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we were observing how the MTA subways are often crowded with homeless people which led to us thinking about why they were there instead of seeking shelters and food places. After interviews, we noticed that some people were simply unaware of where to go nor did they have access to resources that could help. With that knowledge, we decided to build something that would inform them of where they needed to address their specific needs, whether it be food, shelter, or something else.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    HomeMore is a website that contains a map listing various facilities and establishments that homeless people can access for their needs. The user clicks the title of a facility and more information will be listed such as capacity, percentage of capacity filled currently, address, and services provided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, Javascript, and CSS were utilized to create the website. Adobe XD was used for graphic design.

                <p>
                    The time limit forced us to rush and the scale of our idea required more time than we were allotted. There were only two programmers on the team which bottlenecked coding. We do not have a perfect perspective of the homeless situation, but we did our best to stay as objective and unbiased as we could.

                <p>
                    Even with a low time limit, we were able to prepare a Minimally Viable Product that shows a process for registration and usage with the website.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned about how to use APIs, specifically the google maps, along with NYC Open Data, Intro to Project Management, the situation regarding homeless people in NYC, Design Thinking, and Pitching101.
