                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I remember how stressful it was last boxing day to find the best deal online. What made it more difficult is the vast number of e-commerce websites that offer the same products for multiple different prices. PricePoint eliminates the need to survey multiple websites, spending multiple hours in hopes to get the best deal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PricePoint retrieves data from multiple websites such as Amazon, eBay and Walmart based on the product the user specifies and elegantly displays the information on our own website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scraped data from websites in an automated process using UIPath and retrieved and displayed data using an online website built on javascript, HTML, CSS, and bootstrap library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the information from the UIPath scraping to the website itself posed as a problem that we overcame through learning about JSON libraries and lists of objects. Furthermore, retrieving the information itself using UIPath required us to build a solid understanding of UIPath and displaying the information in a pleasant way was overcome through using handeler.js and card views.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to connect the components of the project from the UIPath to the website was a major accomplishment along with creating an intuitive user interface and which provided the found data to users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built upon our knowledge of web development and learned automation through the use of UIPath API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PricePoint
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to focus on incorporating the UIPath API directly into the website and further developing the data scraped and overall user experience.
