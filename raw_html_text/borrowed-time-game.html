                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the game Superhot, which also plays with temporal mechanics. We wanted to incorporate this into a 2D, cooperative environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a 2-player game in which you must cooperate to succeed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java and libgdx to program this game, and we used hand-drawn assets on paper in order to create the art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We automatically generated the levels in this game, which was difficult to make work at first, but it paid off in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully implemented parallax scrolling backgrounds and functional enemies to our game, in addition to original artwork and mechanics, and came out with a pretty well-polished game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about

                <h2>
                    What's next for Borrowed Time Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add a bit more polish to this game, including a title screen and pause screen, and more variety of enemies and worlds for players to try out.
