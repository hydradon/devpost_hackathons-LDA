                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team enjoys playing multi-player web games at home with our friends. We wanted to recreate the energy from playing an electronic came in a physical room, while allowing players to use their phones as keypad controllers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zombeans is a game of tag, where the object is to avoid colliding with a zombie on the playing ground. Up to 10 players can join the game room via a room code that is generated every time a game is run. Players enter the room code on their phones. One player will be randomly assigned the Wizard, one will start as a zombie, and the others will be regular characters. The Wizard character's controlls are different from those of the others, as he/she can throw actions onto the others such as "slow down" or "speed up". The game ends after 60 seconds, and whoever survived the zombies wins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app uses a Python/Flask backend and a Typescript/React frontend. Real time data is streamed is streamed from all users to the server using websockets. Similarly, the server updates the web frontend with new game state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we had different developers working on the frontend and backend, integrating the two pieces comes with significant difficulty. For this reason, we created a detailed sequence diagram to document the game flow, and wrote a JSON specification to make client/server communication easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement almost all the features we set out to implement at the beginning of the weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication is key!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Zombeans
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to small details that were beyond the scope of this weekend, we want to support game obstacles and different maps. This will make the app into a robust product.
