                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team has a very international background. We all had to deal with immigration services at some point in our lives. To register for health insurance we may need to confirm our employment status. When signing up for a bank account we may need to confirm our residency address and so forth. To prove those things, it usually involves getting a document with an official stamp from a government office. Those offices are only available at certain times of the day, not on weekends or holidays. We wanted to come up with a better way to easily and securely complete those cumbersome tasks using blockchain technology.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It stores a persons visa status in a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Immigrants can access their own data at any time of the day without visiting a government office.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        That data can be accessed only by authorized parties. A) the government and B) the immigrant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Additionally every now and then the Government will have to change the visa status. They can do that without input from the immigran
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every information put in by the government can have a expiry date
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built three frontends for the different use cases we have.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A immigrant verifying his/her visa status
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A immigration officer first registering the immigrant at the border, including the persons private passphrase
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A government official who is changing the visa status without input from the immigrant
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Information about an immigrant is retrieved using an anonymous hash.
                </p>
