                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a student at UC Merced, who
                    <em>
                        wants to graduate
                    </em>
                    , it's obvious that the current school provided graduation planner was not sufficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Has a data base of (some) majors available at UC Merced, and a planner that gives information on prerequisites, units, applicability to major requirements, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using ReactJS, we avoided using server side code for speed purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the unusual nature of unidirectional data flow in React, we had to change the way we thought about object oriented programming. We also had a hard time with accumulating all of the applicable courses into a format that's easily readable by code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Why, the whole project of course. :)

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had learned React.
