                <p>
                    "The Day Without Hispanics" that took place in the nation shocked us and was miscommunicated with our community leading to many problems. We wanted to make sure that everyone is able to communicate exactly what it is they want to do for protests and how people can get involved.

                <p>
                    Connect the organizers and the protestors together; allows the sponsors to team up with organizers; educate the protestors with a better organized protest.
