                    We were inspired by the popular "meme" regarding how a dog would wear jeans. We also wanted 3D printers. So we applied this meme to dinosaurs, and created a story regarding how two factions fight eachother and there is one chosen one that can resolve the conflict. This led to the idea of a Where's Wally-esque video game where you need to find the "Dappersaurus" (has a fancy hat) in a scene full of dinos.

                <p>
                    We randomly generate the positions of the dinosaurs in pre-constructed backgrounds that have a masking function applied to them to generate an intuitive depth. We fine tuned our algorithms to create a presentable product that would be engaging to the player.

                    Only HTML, CSS and JavaScript (with JQuery) were used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We realized that without libraries or different web tools such as .NET, development of a game is awkward. However, with a tight schedule, we went through and made the most of our current knowledge which sometimes led to unique, seemingly unintuitive solutions to problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are most proud that we did not use any library other than JQuery, making us have a sense of full ownership of the project. We are happy that we all were intergral to the final project and have a strong sense of team unity.
