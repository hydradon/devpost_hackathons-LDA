                    Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea came up during the viewing of Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s breakthrough back-to-front memory thriller, called Memento. In this movie, the person named Pearce, as a result of a past trauma, suffers from anterograde amnesia (the inability to form new memories) and suffers short-term memory loss approximately every five minutes. He is searching for the persons who attacked him and killed his wife, by taking Polaroid photographs to assist him with memorization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does it solve?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neurodegenerative disease is a term that describes the loss of structure and even the death of neurons. Parkinson&lsquo;s Disease (PD) and Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease (AD) are two of the most common neurodegenerative diseases that most people are familiar with, where these brain diseases cause a slow decline in memory, thinking and reasoning skills. Memory loss is a common symptom of neurodegenerative disease; some may refer to symptoms as dementia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of research being done to determine how to prevent and manage memory loss associated with neurodegenerative disease and other causations, but there&rsquo;s limited technology that solves the problem related to coping with memory loss as well as organizing, managing, storing and recalling memories for patients with neurodegenerative and memory ailments. This
                    <strong>
                        is
                    </strong>
                    the problem that iLET attempts to solve!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Goal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware: iLET is a wearable assistive technology headset that is designed to serve patients with memory loss and neurodegenerative disorders to help them with coping with memory loss as well as organizing, managing, storing and recalling memories in their lives at any time and at any location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Software: iLET Pro is the companion Android app to our iLET headset hardware. It is designed to carry out functions related to organizing, managing, storing and recalling memories in patient&rsquo;s lives at any time and at any location. iLET Pro also consists of AI-based machine-learning bot that recognizes patterns in patient&rsquo;s app usage and accomplishes certain tasks, such as automatic recording, storing and organizing patient&rsquo;s memories.
