                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The possibilities of automation in a modern home are endless. We wanted to focus on some of the most important audio/video based applications we could think of for a modern household.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project brings home automation a step closer to being more mainstream by integrating features using the Bose SoundTouch API to make life easier. This was achieved by:
    1. Being your entertainer: Based on the mood of the users, the application plays an appropriate Spotify playlist without the user having to lift a finger.
    2. Being your guardian: The application sounds an alarm at maximum volume when it detects intruders lurking near your windows/balcony and sends you an SMS alert too.
    3. Being the DJ at your parties: The application allows your guests to play, pause, and navigate through the playlist without them having to install any app.
    4. Being your assistant: The application automatically plays your favorite playlist when it senses that you've entered
the house.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole application is hosted on Flask, with different end points for different functionalities. An external webcam is used to detect users and intruders. OpenCV serves as a backend for the face and emotion recognition models. For intrusion detection we use the Twilio API to send SMS messages. The Bose SoundTouch API gives us all the functionalities of the universal remote. An HTML front-end backed by JavaScript makes the interface that the guests can use to interact with the speakers without having to pair with them or install any app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was integrating so many components together to make one working solution. Getting the Spotify API set up was a big challenge for us and took a considerable amount of time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how we were able to expand the usability of the speakers to do more than just play music from an app. We are also proud of how we were able to pick up new skills to get this project done.
