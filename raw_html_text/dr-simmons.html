                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows for facebook users to cope with depressed, anxiety and other forms of mental illness by creating a non-judgemental environment where they can only express themselves. The chatbot is split into a therapy session and an educational game on depression. The game utilizes open-ended answers and allows the player to follow their own path and explore an impoverished city as an individual dealing with depression.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a node.js server on Heroku's cloud platform to act as a chatbot for our Facebook page, Dr.Simmons. The server acts as the middleman between the chatbot and wit.ai. By integrating wit.ai, we were able to give unrestricted user responses values and respond accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
