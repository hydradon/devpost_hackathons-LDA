                    This skill helps you to stay fit. On the start screen you can choose a muscle group (legs, chest etc) and get to a list of relevant exercises. When you choose an exercise you get to the screen where it will be explained. There is playing a video of it in a loop and next to it, there is detailed description about what is important and how the exercise works. There is also a visual indicator of the difficulty and the info which muscles are working in this exercise.
Also from the start screen you can choose one of the workouts (the collection is complete in the next days), which have an increasing level of diffculty. The workout video is meant to participate and work with live at the same time. On the side of the video there is also the list of the specific workout. If you need more info about a certain exercise eg how it works, you can always say the name of the exercise and get to the explanation of it.
For the first version of the skill, there will be added some more content (workouts and execises).
