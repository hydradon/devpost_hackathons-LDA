                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both believe that mental health is an important topic that does not get talked about enough nor has enough resources for people who may need help. Therefore, we developed a mobile application that allows anyone to keep track of their daily moods and talk to a virtual assistant. Our app allows people to get the help they need through many relevant organizations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lampy is a mood tracking iOS app. It asks the user daily how they felt that day. Moreover, our lampy provides relevant tips on how to manage your emotions while also giving users the access to mental health organizations to get the help they need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lampy is built using Swift4 &amp; Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not being super familiar with Swift. There were a few features we wanted to implement, but just didn't know how/have the time. For example, our profile page is incomplete, so we had to set a temporary name variable to get the app working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For two people that aren't familiar with Swift or Xcode, we got a lot done in 8 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code in Swift and the basics of Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lampy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to transform the tracker into a calendar that displays the user's mood for every day.
