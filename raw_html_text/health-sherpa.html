                    In Germany every employee spend in average 19,5 days of sick leave per year. The current healthcare systems all over the world are focusing mainly on sick care instead of sickness prevention. Fitness applications does a very good job visualizing your personal data, but do not suggest any preventive measures or recommendations neither they combine this data with known information about weather, pollution, nutrition and healthcare hazards. Its current goal is not to cure serious diseases but to keep the user healthy.

                    The data collection can be a challenge specifically in Europe, which is under the GDPR consumer data protection law. However we rely on the api provided by Thryve health for database access of consumer.
Also the user experience can be considered a challenge - how to make the product engaging and make it to a daily habit
