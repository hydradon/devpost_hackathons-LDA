                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone in our team sucks at cooking. Most apps that try to help you out with cooking tend to get complicated quickly, especially since they don't consider nutrients and calorie counts and allergies. We decided to make something to fix that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Open your fridge, tell the app what you see in it, and just follow the recipes that it shows! Future versions will include options to include everything you need to take care of your health, such as direct information from your nutritionist/doctors and including things such as allergies to make sure that you get the most healthy meal that you can make!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with a simple idea: people are
                    <strong>
                        lazy
                    </strong>
                    , but willing to learn to be better. Most college students love pizza because they really don't know what else to make, and miss home. We tried other recipe apps to see what they did, and we'd get discouraged when we realized that we didn't have the right ingredients, forcing us to eventually give up and order take out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we took a different approach: let's start with what you already have, then find recipes from there! We chose voice recognition as our way of conveying what we had in the fridge because of the simplicity that was involved when telling it what you had.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that starting point in mind, we started building the app, and here's what each individual member did:
