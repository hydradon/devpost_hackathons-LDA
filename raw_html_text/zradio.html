                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waiting for the favorite melody to be played at radio but never happened. The song that I've heard at one of my friends and searched the whole internet and never found it. That feeling you get when you are listening your favorite song on YouTube autoplay and after 30 minutes you hear the song "Portugalia" by Florin Salam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ZRadio is an intelligent system, that plays songs from social networks based on users' preferences. You can have multiple sources (Facebook, YouTube, SoundCloud, Online radio streams etc.). The songs are dynamically fetched from the APIs and a playlist is created based on users' preferences. You can customize each source as you want. For example, you can exclude songs posted by Tiberian Popovici on Facebook, because you don't like the churches choir, you can even play only the songs that have at least 10 likes etc. The system is intelligent enough to not play the same song over and over again.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From scratch.
We tried to use SCRUM / AGILE
We gather libraries and components using Composer. 
We implemented a solution using some APIS(Facebook, Youtube, etc) 
We used LAMP configuration.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We had some communication problems, but we managed to overcome it.
We had some configuration problems.
