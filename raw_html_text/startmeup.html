                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the team and I where going through and reading all the different challenges that where being proposed the challenge set by Chase caught our attention especially since 3 of us have worked for a startup in the past. We wanted to build a platform to allow anyone with a passion for creating any kind of business to thrive and be successful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would help an aspiring entrepreneur find out what steps they need to do to get started creating their new business. First by tackling basics like helping to get an EIN. The second step would be to help the user with research as far as finding out about other business in the same industry in the area where you want to setup your startup, with this we create statistical models that can help the user determine based on history of the area if this type of business works there(As the saying goes 'location, location, location'). We then help the user with financial education as far as what they should consider for a 1yr and 5 yr plan, what types of financial institutions offer there type/size of business a loan, and legislative assistance offered for that area. The last step would be compiling all the data entered by the user and creating a business plan and financial plan which they can print and take to a lender to invest in their new business.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a python stack of django, jinja2, numpy, sql, html, css, bootstrap to accomplish this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The initial issues we ran into was simply setting up the environment. ideally we would have wanted to use 3 different types of databases in order to improve performance and increase features available to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to at least setup the database and create a basic frontend a well as some financial logs with the search for businesses in the desired area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea may have been to ambitious for a hackathon however, we did learn a lot about how data science can help shape information and provide excellent concrete results
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StartMEUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to be able to finish the prototype completely. all of us in the team feel that this application can help minority entrepreneurs take their first successful steps, as well as, help financial institutions and government agencies with data on all the small up and coming businesses and how to create legislation to help them grow.
