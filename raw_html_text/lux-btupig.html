                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has felt bogged down and unable to get back up at least once in their life, and needs a pick up to keep going. Sometimes we don't have instant access to a person who can help talk it out with us, so we wanted to make an program that would send inspiring messages to an individual at the touch of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of the page, our system asks for a phone number. After entering, an auto-generated inspiring text message will be sent to that number.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we Built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew we wanted to create a project about Health, but we didn&rsquo;t know what we wanted to do. It was brainstorm session. Eventually, we decided to focus on mental health and thus us the idea to build what we have. We split the work between frontend and backend. For the front-end we started with a static website, a skeleton of what we wanted. Then we would further work on the site to make it look nicer and the javasript for better flow. For the back-end we worked with Twilio API and created a Python Flask server to host the site and communicate between Twilio and our site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main difficulty was connecting the phone number we received as input to Twilio's text messaging system. Our team had experience in back-end generation of messages and the front-end display of the website, but we had little experience in connectivity between servers and sending requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a fully funcitoning site that actually takes advantage of Twilio API to send messages!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to connect servers through Python and Flask, and learned how to organize our code in different pieces better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lux
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to incorporate more personalization into the project, allowing people signing up to fill out basic information about themselves so our system can create even better-fitting messages for individuals. We also want to include the option for pictures to be sent based on what animals people like.
