                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building upon party-like games such as Kahoot, we created an innovative new game-mode that allows players to competitively answer questions. The game works best in person, using gestures such as swiping to players to your left or right to tie the game into reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players log-in anonymously with a nickname, create or join a room using a room code, and wait for their friends or colleagues to join. Once in, players each gain a randomly selected question. If they answer correctly, they can then swipe the question away to their peers on the left or right -- giving them a backlog of questions to answer! Answering a question incorrectly will cause two new questions to be added to your backlog. The winner is the player with the fewest questions in their hand remaining to answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game incentivises fast recall and competitive game-play, aiding in learning and retention. It can be applied in a fun, party-game setting, or could be applied in an educational setting to reinforce knowledge and quiz students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.JS + Express.JS + Socket.IO [for realtime communication], in addition to plain old HTML, JavaScript, and CSS -- no fancy Angular or React!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building the back-end presented a number of challenges, particularly with regards to synchronising players. The front-end also presented learning opportunities with regards to CSS, and designing from a mobile-first perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game concept itself also took a while to refine and flesh out fully. This took a lot of team communication and deliberation to come up with a final product we were all happy with, that we believe would best tackle the challenge and bring communities together.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app works -- which is an achievement in itself on a time limit, with new technologies, and a distinctive lack of sleep!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're also proud of our idea, and believe it approaches the challenge in a unique and creative fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use and apply the various technologies that we used for the project, in addition to good team communication skills.
