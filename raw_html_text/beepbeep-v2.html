                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The beepBeep robot serves as a wonderful proof of concept and model for larger scale projects. These projects can inlcude medical applications, and numerous hmi applications.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The beepBeep using its compainion app is able to take directions from a user, remember and replay those directions. Using it's sensors it is also able to aviod dangerous situations, and prevent against poor quality users.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    BLE with arduino 101 is very new and underdeveloped, there isn't alot for me to work with, but it's really exciting being at the frontier edge of this technology, even though there are limited resources. 
I also ran into issues where the hardware broke(wheels).
