                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever found yourself clicking on a chain of Facebook profiles and eventually realizing you're on your cousin's husband's best friend from college's Facebook page? And then you
                    <strong>
                        accidentally like
                    </strong>
                    one of their pictures. To save yourself from social media embarrassment when you've gone down the rabbit hole in Facebook stalking, this extension
                    <strong>
                        prevents you from liking, commenting, or sharing
                    </strong>
                    a post, while not blocking any other functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prevents you from accidentally liking a Facebook picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a Google Chrome extension
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had ever worked with Chrome extensions so in the last 24 hours we familiarized ourselves with various Chrome Platform APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members had never used HTML, CSS, or JS before and by the end she was hacking like a pro.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Down the Rabbit Hole
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile! The problem of accidentally liking a post or picture is much more common when browsing Facebook on a mobile device, so our next step is to add this "Stealth mode" to mobile devices.
