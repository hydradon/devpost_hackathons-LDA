                </h2>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows manipulation of volume and tempo of a song based using specified gestures
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created an algorithm to change tempo, then linked tempo and volume changes to gestures.  Then created a GUI to run the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tempo was difficult to manipulate without simultaneously while manipulating pitch, because changing the rate of playback of a sound file straight up will also change the frequency of the sound waves, affecting pitch.  When we finally had methods to manipulate tempo, we had a bad audio file that made us think it didn't work and wasted lots of time trying to find a solution.
