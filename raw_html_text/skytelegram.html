                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use different APIs to learn how they work. Telegram and SkyScanner were the perfect combination for our needs because they both have a wrapper for Python and we thought that it would be useful to ask for a flight directly to Telegram.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It searches for the next flight to the cities indicated to the Telegram bot via text or via a voice note.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python as a programing lenguage, and a bunch of libraries and dependances like the
                    <a href="https://python-telegram-bot.org" rel="nofollow">
                        Telegram Python wrapper
                    </a>
                    for the Telegram bot comunication, the
                    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/" rel="nofollow">
                        SpeechRecognition
                    </a>
                    library for the speech function, the
                    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/audiosegment/" rel="nofollow">
                        AudioSegment wrapper
                    </a>
                    for transform audio files to be compatible with the differents libraries and ffmpeg framework as a dependence of AudioSegment. Also we used Hidora to host the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the firsts challenges has been to implement the SpeechRecognition funcionality because the Telegram bot uses a type of audio file that is incompatible for the SpeechRecognition library and we needed to convert the files with the ffmpeg framework and we had difficulties to deploy a docker with this framework installed in it.
Also, another challenge was to read and understant the documentation of the API's and the functionalities of them that weren't in the documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to build the entire bot and all it's dependencies in a docker for an seamless deployment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some members of the team hadn't worked with APIs and dockers before, so we learned about them. It was quite a challenge at first but finally we could understand them enough to work with as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SkyTelegram
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Optimize the usage of the Skyscanner API so we can give a faster response, recognize a date and some preferencies from the user in order to offer a suitable flight, not only answer with the cheapest flight and
 bring translations, so the user can choose between many languages.
