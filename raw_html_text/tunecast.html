                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to find a project that we were all passionate about. We all love music and use Spotify on a daily basis. After throwing out a few ideas, we agree that we wanted to tweak Spotify to make it even more personalized. Despite the freedom that streaming platforms like Spotify provide with their

                        <em>
                            create a playlist

                    option, it can often be difficult to find music that you enjoy listening to on a daily basis. Additionally, it is apparent that weather phenomena often have a great impact on the daily behaviors and moods in our lives; a sudden thunderstorm can sour the mood of a businessman leaving lunch in a full suit. These seemingly unrelated subjects find tangential ground with
                    <strong>
                        TuneCast
                    </strong>
                    , a browser application that connects to Spotify in order to curate a playlist of songs that you most commonly frequent with the attributes of the weather.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Has the sudden arrival of radiant sunshine ever given you a boost in energy? What about a clear summer night and the prospect of dancing the night away with friends? These associative feelings we hold towards the weather can act as a stimulant for the expression of emotions. Coupled with the inherently expressive nature of music listening and consumption, Tunecast curates a custom playlist based on the user's music preferences and the weather to represents the intersection of what we are feeling and hearing in our daily lives.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began our project using the
                    <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/" rel="nofollow">
                        Spotify Web API Quick Start Documentation
                    </a>
                    using Javascript, CSS, and HTML. We made API calls to both Darksky for weather data and Spotify for personalized music data which we used to develop an algorithm to create a personalized playlist for the Spotify user based on the weather. We correlated specific weather qualities to music qualities to curate a special playlist to fit the taste of the user and the mood from the weather.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble following the architecture and data flow of the Spotify starter code. We had difficulty passing data to follow the original style that Spotify follows.
We also had difficulty dealing with asynchronous functions as we made multiple API calls.

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we were able to link data between two APIs and create a product that we were able to display clearly on our webpage. The personalized playlist also auto-populates into the user's Spotify account on creation.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project gave us all a lot more experience using Javascript, CSS, and HTML. We learned how to better read and use API documentation.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve the code style of the project for the future, along with the interface design. Though we are very proud of how we were able to get our app to look and function during this hackathon, there are still things that we could improve on.
