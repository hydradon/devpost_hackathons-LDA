                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After trying out lots of expense-tracking apps during my time on Android and iOS, I found that none of them were as flexible, as portable and as simple to use as the good ol' spreadsheet. Over time, I developed certain conventions that work well for me, but editing a spreadsheet on mobile is still a horrible experience, so I wanted to build a better way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides an easy-to-use mobile interface for entering expense items into a spreadsheet that you've already crafted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to use:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Authenticate and authorize with your Google account.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enter the name of your spreadsheet in Google Drive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fill in the details of your expense (these are based on
                        <em>
                            your
                        </em>
                        spreadsheet's columns) and submit!
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    It's easy to track your expenses when you can record them effortlessly. Since the app lives on the web, you'll have access to it no matter what platform you're on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was written in Javascript, HTML and CSS. The app talks to the Google Sheets API via Google's Javascript client libraries. I then generated an HTML form based on the columns that already exist in the spreadsheet. For the mobile-friendly layout, I used Spectre.css, which is also apparently pretty lightweight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Google Sheets API only allows spreadsheets to be queried using a non-human-readable name, so I needed to locate it via the Google Drive API.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finding a hosting service that wasn't overkill for serving a static page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Styling the app so that it would render nicely on mobile screens.
                    </li>
