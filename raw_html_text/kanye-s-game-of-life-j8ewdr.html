                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always been interested in cellular automata in my academic life and hip hop in my personal life. This was a way to try to combine both of those.

                <p>
                    The Kanye's Game of Life (KGoL) board follows the rules set in Conway's Game of Life (

                    ). For each cell, there is a sound byte (of a note or hip hop ad lib) linked to the cell. If a given cell is alive in a generation, it will play its soundbyte. Because of the nature of Conway's Game of Life, the next generation of each board is determined by the previous generation, so the music will generate itself.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. I stripped hip hop ad libs from youtube videos and some of the other soundbytes came from open source projects using launchpads.

                    Challenges I ran into

                    I really couldn't make it sound like anything good. At best it sounds... interesting.

                    I am proud of completing this hack on my own and making my vision for an application a reality.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned that JavaScript isn't that scary of a language after all. I've also learned how to make single page web apps.

                    I'm going to be working on improving UI, allowing users to upload custom sound bytes, and saving/loading songs.
