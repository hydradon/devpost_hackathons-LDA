                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Detroit human was a text video game that taught us the importance of our actions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program goes through the life of a little kid and gives them the ability to choose their decisions. It shows them the consequences of their actions. It teaches morality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used switch statements and objects in Java to create the code. We heavily used Github to collaborate and share our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Github was hard to grasp, BUT we learned it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating something out of nothing and working very well as a team. We completed our first hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more Javascript, Json (although we didn't get to use it in the final product), and Github!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Good to the Bones
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Good to the Bones should have more scenarios and let the users choose the locations that they want to go.
