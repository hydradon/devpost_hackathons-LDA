                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While enjoying mandatory fun Chris and I realized that we could use the countless laps on the track and translate it into useful data via a wearable device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept of Make Moves is a Smart Shoe which can calculate a runner's distance run, average speed, heart rate, calorie burn, and the pressure points on their feet (where they contact the ground). It can help runners fix or work on their form as well as be used for physical therapy, such as to help correct flat footed-ness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using C++ and an Arduino/Micro-processor (Intel Edison) to, in theory, take in the raw data and process it at which point it sends it via Bluetooth to the Android application, written in Java, which displays the information for the user. (This was never achieved)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bluetooth was our biggest challenge, we were never able to achieve a stable connection which would transmit data. Due to this we were unable to complete our hack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into other problems here and there but Bolted past them. We had to jog our memories to and dust off a few of our skills that we hadn't used in a while (such as C++ and Android development).
                </p>

                    What's next for Make Moves
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The closet probably, maybe a box next to the power glove and smart helmet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or a multi-million dollar start-up. Who knows?
