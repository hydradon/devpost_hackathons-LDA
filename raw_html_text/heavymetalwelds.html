                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to learn how to build websites from scratch using HTML and I wanted to see show off welding ideas and concepts given that non-welders have a hard time understanding the skill involved.

                <p>
                    It was difficult to initially launch the site, but I was able to figure out the HTML sideof the project.
