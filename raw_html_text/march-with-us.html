                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Marches have become much more prevalent across the country. Even with this increase in attendances, there are still those who are hesitant to physically attend, or want to know more about the cause from a safe and comfortable space. This experience could also serve as a means for those who are unable to attend marches due to accessibility or health conditions to feel a part of the cause without being there in person.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attended the Women's March in Santa Cruz and took 360 photos to create an immersive environment that VR users can experience. Photos taken from the event were loaded in the Android SDR.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Attend other Marches to collect a range of experiences for people to choose from and learn about causes bringing people to the streets. The app could still use polishing too.
