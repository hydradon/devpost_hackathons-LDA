                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Veritasium YouTube video where Line-X coated watermelon is dropped from 100m tower.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Line-X is a polyurea coating that absorbs impact and reduces damage to whatever it is applied to.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This isn't something that we as students have the resources to put into production. However, we conceptualized how it would be applied to an airplane and the costs that would be incurred.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Staying on track. Doubting the idea that we'd come up with. Finding details about hail damage. Ability to test any of our theories.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We learned a whole lot about polymer coatings and about working as a team to come to a solution.
