                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Search - is a functionality of the site let&rsquo;s you find the information like phone number, address, email id etc if  there is a potential match with the existing people in the database. We use the powerful constitutional neural networks based clarifAI API to find the closest match of the searched image in the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Report - is a feature through which a submission of abondoned or lonely individuals can be posted by someone who&rsquo;s willing to help the lost person. On every submission of image, we train our Neural Network model so that it can identify if there&rsquo;s a similar image posted through search at some later point in time in the application.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've used Python Flask framework and SQL Alchemy in the back-end. Mainly used clarifai API to identify the matches in the model created with new reports submitted through the application.
On the front-end, we've used HTML, CSS, Ajax, JavaScript, BootStrap to build this application.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Using imgur api to create a public URL for the image uploaded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Seamless integration of multiple APIs like Clarifai, Twilio, imgur to make this application completely RESTful.
Successfully training the concepts of the customized model in clarifai API.
