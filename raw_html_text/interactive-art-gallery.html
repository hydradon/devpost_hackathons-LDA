                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from one of our group members who made an amazing image and we felt that we had to come up with a great way to display it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People will be able to edit the art gallery and upload they're own unique gallery for people to enjoy for themselves. Just download the gallery and start up the program. By simply walking around with WASD and looking around with the mouse, you can experience great creations of art made by various different people. If you want to take a closer look, just hold shift to zoom in on a creation.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original idea was to create a virtual reality guitar hero like game where you punched the notes instead of press a button. Unfortunately the Razer Hydras we were trying to use for hand tracking would not work and we were forced to change ideas.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a working game in the little we had left.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always test your hardware before ever committing to a project built around it.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allowing people to create name tags for the artwork so they can know what the piece is called.
