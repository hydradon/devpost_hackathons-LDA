                    Have you ever wanted to watch TV, but your family or roommate are being too loud? Are you at the bar, but you can't listen to your sports game because it's not on the main TV? Will your friends ever stop talking during the movie? Well, look no further! We have created All Ears to block out any distractions between you and your real best friend, the television. With All Ears, you can open your phone browser, input the IP address you want to connect to and voila! You're listening to whatever is streaming on the television, whether it's Netflix or just music! You can also allow your friends to connect as well (even though we know you're trying to avoid them).
