                    The problem we have decided to solve is not having an accurate risk assessment of individual drivers before they get signed up for a car insurance policy. Currently, insurers ask for home address, age, gender, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution we have come up with is adding another variable into the machine learning model, such as risk directly correlated with work address. A big portion of our driving is to and from work. Depending on the road we choose to take to work, our risk levels can vary widely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data sets we have used from Kaggle using insurance premiums predictions allowed us to predict the premium more accurately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we have two supervised machine learning models, their correlation between the road traveled is not very different due to lack of real data. We have used AWS Amazon&rsquo;s Sage Maker and using their Jupyter Notebook using Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conclusively, the insurance company should take this factor into consideration, there is about 20% accuracy and significant room for improvement, which could be achieved using real data.
