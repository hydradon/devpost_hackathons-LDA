                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often we I got sick, I just let it be without proper treatement, this often make the situation worse. I need someone to give me advice on how to handle my sickness without me skipping classes or sacrifice sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will diagnose issues base on your symptom, and give you recommendations on treatments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the bot with Microsoft bot framework, and medicAPI. The bot framework provides natural language processing and extracting the keywords we need to send to medicAPI. The API can handle the issue diagnose and treatment recommendation. Then we deploy the app on Azure, and allow users to access it from Slack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first using C# and visual studios, my team and I were having troubles print the error message to the console. Since the log was absorbed by the bot emulator. Also, trying to learn a brand new syntax and library were hard, since the tutorials we have been using uses the yet to come out version of visual studio, we could not build the app the same way.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a psudo AI that is able to help people stay healthy.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C#, and bot-framework. Now we can write and train our own AIs.

                <p>
                    Trying to maintain the context in a chat, allow user to ask "how to treat that", and other reference instead repeating the issue or symptom each time.
