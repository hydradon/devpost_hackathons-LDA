                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jessica, a member of our team, is also a member of MRover. As part of MRover, she frequently schedules and attends meetings with various subteams of MRover. The current process works by everyone sending their Google Calendar information to one person, and that person choosing a time when everyone is free. While this method works, it does not respect the privacy of the members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh Jun, another member of our team, is rushing a frat. This frat requires him to schedule three interviews with different brothers every week for the rest of the semester. While the interviews are fun and informative, scheduling them is a time-consuming and tedious task that takes hours instead of seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ScheduleUs is built for speed and simplicity. To use the service, users must first create an account. During this process, the user choose a username, enter their phone number, and will authenticate their Google account and give permission for the app to access Calendar data. The account is now created.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to scheduling an event, a user first creates an event, specifying the "end date" of the event. For example, if you want to find a time between now and a week from now, the "end date" would be a week in the future. Then, you search for the usernames of the people you wish to find a time with. When you find them, click add. This will automatically send a text to the users, asking them to confirm that they are part of the event. Once they confirm, it's done! The app will automatically generate a visualization that shows when everyone is free!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Django web framework to build our web application. We chose Django because every member felt fairly confident programming using Python. For the Google authentication and Calendar data retrieval, we used Google's Developer APIs. For the texting service, we used Twilio's APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first challenge was ideation. The entirety of day one was spent ideating, but our team still could not decide on one idea. During our five hours ideating, we thought of all sorts of applications and services ranging from augmented reality stickers to news-related conversational artificial intelligence. We decided to sleep on it, and the next day we all came back with a fresh mind and quickly agreed on one idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also had technical challenges. Even though we were all fairly confident in Python, the Django framework was new to most of us. So our first challenge was to familiarize ourselves with this new framework and fundamental web development concepts. We got through this by reading online guides as well as discussing different ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we had physical challenges. After long streams of programming, we all at some point felt tired, sleep-deprived, and a bit disgusting. How did we get past this challenge? Well, we didn't...
