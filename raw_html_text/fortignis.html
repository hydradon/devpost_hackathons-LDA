                <p>
                    Our motto: Creating passion, building foundations
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not one loves to hit the books and study, seriously, unless you are a hardcore mugger. At Fortignis, we believe the average student can succeed with smiles with no frowns because the days of rote learning are gone!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plagued with tuition throughout his childhood, the founder hopes that learning can be more interactive and independent in a new world of sharing economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are not just an educational platform. We are a company with the fortitude to ignite change in our education landscape, with a genuine heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is hard to imagine a day when we de-emphasize memorization and focus on creativity. We want to encourage a friendly student culture where seniors can step in to help their juniors. We want to create an environment that can blend students&rsquo; psychological needs to their learning. Students can go to school without a heavy bag or even a heavy heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That&rsquo;s why you should Fortignis textbooks from now!

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have adequate manpower to help us with the coding. As it has quite some features, it will take at least a few weeks to develop the entire features.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we did a web cover prototype within 12 hours.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to code and how to use HTML. However, as a beginner, it was never easy to completely grasp the knowledge of what has been taught.
