                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to create this model for a personal challenge. My goal was to create the most accurate model I could, and the model was successful in impressing me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It detects malaria in cells and it includes a demo GUI for visualizing this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with Tensorflow 2 and Keras. I also used a GTX 1080 for training the model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to modify the dense layers various times to reduce overfitting, which occurred very quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about convolutional neural networks and how to design them. I also made various models, and I tested different pre-trained models with transfer learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Malaria Detection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventually, I look forward to revisiting this project and making it even more accurate.
