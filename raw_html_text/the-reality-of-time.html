                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the sophomore year of high school, I (Ishan) took AP World History. One of the topics which I covered was the transition of railroad time to standardized time in the United States. After doing extra research about this topic, I was interested in figuring out how much time we had lost since the standardization of time in November 1883 and what the time today would have been if we stuck to railroad time. We sought to figure this out through mathematical algorithms and a Google Maps API.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user will hover above a certain location. The application outputs the longitude of the location as well as the simulated time at which you hovered above that location. Latitude does not play a role.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ishan initially wrote out the algorithms using MATLAB as a guideline. Then, Benjamin worked on getting the output of the algorithm to display in an interpret-able way for users by utilizing Flask, a web framework. The algorithm was then reiterated as javascript and interfaced with the user interaction portion of the Google Maps API. The whole project was then hosted by Heroku.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we ran into was figuring out how to translate the original algorithm into javascript, due to the difference in syntax and general libraries provided. Figuring out how to host the program onto Heroku for easy access was also a challenge since none of us had any experience with Flask.

                    We are proud of turning a set of algorithms into a user-friendly Google Maps format.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to put our programming and mathematics knowledge to translate an algorithm into a web-based application.

                <p>
                    After being able to host this application using a Google Maps API, we hope to implement this application to a Google Earth or ArcGIS API so that users can visualize time differences in 3D, especially in cases around the North and South Poles.
