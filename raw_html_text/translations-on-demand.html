                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a messaging platform for people of different linguistic backgrounds, so that everyone from all around the world can communicate with one another in real time. Our goal was to overcome the language barrier that may have interfered with interpersonal relationships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Businesses which have chat support services may also require implementation of a live translation feature.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Translation On Demand allows multiple users to communicate in their language of choice in real time. Built for business and individual needs, it uses the Google Translate API to translate in between an auto-detected language and the target language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Cloud Translation API to power our real-time translations of user messages. Our front-end was built entirely with HTML and CSS, and our back-end was primarily built with PHP, and some amount of javascript. The implementation of the API was done entirely with PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group with minimal web development experience, we struggled with the back-end development with PHP. Only one of our group members had worked with PHP in the past, and so the other members had to learn the language on the go. This was also the first time many of us have worked with an API, so a huge challenge was the actual implementation of the real-time translation messaging. Specifically, the API authentication process conflicted with our localhost servers. We spent the majority of our time this hackathon troubleshooting our back-end problems, and integrating the API into our messaging platform.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of building a seamless experience for users to communicate in different translated languages in real time. We successfully integrated an API with our program and allowed multiple users to talk simultaneously.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate Google's Translation API into a program, programming a PHP backend and using CSS to make the site look good.
