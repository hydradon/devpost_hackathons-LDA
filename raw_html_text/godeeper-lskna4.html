                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever wish you could look more into a subject quickly? Wish that the teacher could expand more on that piece of information that you forgot, but is important for future concepts? Then GoDeeper is the app for you!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GoDeeper is a Pebble Watch app that allows you to look into a subject and get little, bite-sized descriptions of concepts, small enough to read on a little smartwatch screen!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in C using the Pebble C API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C is a lot harder than we thought, as it doesn't use classes like the usual modern languages.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    It does its job.

                    What's next for GoDeeper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Port it to Javascript, make it more than another flashcard app.
