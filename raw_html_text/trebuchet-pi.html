                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trebuchets are the superior siege engine, capable of launching a 90kg payload a distance of 300m. We thought, what if we could remote control a trebuchet, to deliver 90kg payloads more than 300m?

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A wireless controller moves and fires a wooden trebuchet

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A particle photon is connected to a joystick and fire button to create a controller. It sends data to the raspberry pi, which then sends signals to the motors moving the trebuchet and the servo for the fire mechanism
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Debugging the network between the Photon and Pi, as well as researching pin assignments for the package for the Pi were hard

                    Maybe add a camera
