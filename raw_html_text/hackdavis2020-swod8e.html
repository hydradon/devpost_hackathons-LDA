                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a burning desire to help UC Davis with lost and abandoned bike related needs, as well as crowdsourcing functionality to help foster a sense of a more connected community and assistance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bike Connect is a web service dedicated to marking the locations of abandoned bikes, and helping users find their lost bicycles. Using the power of crowdsourcing and Google Maps, BikeConnect connects you with a powerful map tool and friendly community to find lost and abandoned bikes in your area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BikeConnect provides two primary functionalities: a map and reporting systems. Using user-submitted reports and Google Maps API, our application places custom markers on the map using location data from those reports. Each report has commenting functionality so as to get people communicating with each other to help find and identify lost or abandoned bicycles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using React, Adobe XD and Illustrator, Google Firebase and Maps APIs, and pure 100% concentrated power of will, we built the Website, some custom icons, the logo, and the primary functionality.
