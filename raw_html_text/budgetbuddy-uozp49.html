                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There might have been a number of times when we struggle to plan our budget. by keeping track of our expenses.
Many times we would have thought of limiting our budget in a particular category. But it is tiresome to do the statistics to keep track of our spendings filtering on categories. How many of you have thought of having a application where you can plan your budget based on your previous expenses and getting an alert when you exceed it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with that if the application does future investments for you based on your savings as per your budget plan and multiplies your returns it is indeed an add-on
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                    </strong>
                    helps the customer in showing the customer the percentage of their expenses in different categories along with their recent transactions in each category on a specific time interval(daily/ weekly/monthly or yearly basis). In addition, they can set up their budget plan for the coming days by specifying a limit they want to have on their expenses per category. Once their spendings near the limit they have set,
                    <strong>
                        BudgetBuddy
                    </strong>
                    sent an alert to the customer showing the limit the set on that category, the amount they have already spent and the remaining amount they can spend in that time interval . We can keep track of and limit our expenses this way. 
To add more to it, we are planning to add a new feature where the customers receives suggestions on investing their differentials (Budget - expenditures).
                    <br>
                    Along with the above things, the customers can keep track of the basic things like their balances, payments, bills and withdrawals too.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used CapitalOne's API to get the customer info. And used python to extract and derive the data needed.
We created the UI using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript,Bootstrap,D3.js and Ajax. Using Django REST framework made REST calls to nessie API , stored user aspects in MySQL database and business logic for visualizing customer data queried from nessie. Implemented workflows which enable visualization of capital expenditure and savings and investment options.

                <p>
                    Getting to know in what categories you have to cut your extra expenditures really helps us in planning for tomorrow.
