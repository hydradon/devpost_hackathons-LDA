                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More elderly live at home with mild cognitive impairment, which causes severe loss of quality of life and grows fears over self-empowerment.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cognitive memory support: helps finding lost objects at home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create a natural language processing system using Watson Conversation which creates a search query for an object. The search query then runs through Python Backend which sends the query through Google Cloud. Google Cloud searches for the object in our image database. The image database is created and constantly updated through ambiant cameras. It sends the image of the object in its surrounding back to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User interface decisions, speech output difficulties, localization of the object, sensor use for need recognisition.
                </p>
