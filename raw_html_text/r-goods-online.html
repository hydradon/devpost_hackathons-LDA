                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to build a platform for users to be able to located certain goods and services in their area during an unexpected disaster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using google assistant, users are able to ask questions about items, the request is then processed by dialog flow and matched with it's corresponding intent then sent via HTTPS to our API, depending on the request the action will respond with information about a certain item
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created two virtual machines running CentOS. One on Microsoft Azure and another on Google Cloud Products. We then created a remote Mongo Database hosted on Atlas and connected it with node.js to the two separate VM's. We added a traffic manager to act like a load balancer  between the two VM's on Microsoft Azure. Using dialog flow we started to creating intents that would help query information from the Mongo Database. The query is then sent back with information to the user via google assistant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We preferred to work with PHP but instead we went with node.js to make it easier to connect to our remote mongo database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We were able to get google assistant to shutdown certain web servers via google assistant.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We also used Azure's Traffic Manager as a load balancer
                        </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that working with so many different technologies proved to be difficult but definitely doable. We are proud that we were able to create such a vast network off a small idea of trying to help people.
