                    First, we can see that only odd numbers can be the answer, since you have to remove every other element (meaning all even number will be out).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, solving the problem for increasing bigger N's, you can see that we have the solution as being the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    for (1-2) and (1-3) lists, the solutions are (1,3)
                </p>
                <p>
                    for (1-4), (1-5), (1-6), (1-7) the solutions are (1,3,5,7)
                </p>
                <p>
                    for (1-8), (1-9), (1-10), (1-11), (1-12), (1-13), (1-14), (1-15) the solutions are (1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15)
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we have that the solutions are subsets of the list of odd numbers, but with a periodicity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The periodicity is based on powers of 2. That is, the first period is size 2, the second is size 4, the third is size 8, and so on...
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, given a number, we must find where it lies with regard to the period. 
This can be accomplish by figuring out the nearest power of two that is less than N : floor(log_2(n))
Then it is just a matter of figuring out where the number lies in respect to the list of odd numbers... so we have the following formula:
                </p>
                <p>
                    F(N) = (N - 2 ^ (floor(log_2(N))) ) + 1
                </p>
