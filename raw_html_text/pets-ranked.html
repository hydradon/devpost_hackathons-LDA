                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the both of us being animal lovers, we thought it'd be cool for other people to be able to share their cute animal photos for others to see. After all, what is better than looking through cute animal photos if you're feeling depressed, lazy, or just need to waste a couple minutes? Some of our inspiration was drawn from the WeRateDogs&trade; Twitter account. However, we found it only limited to dog lovers. We wanted to create a more diverse and open platform for all animal photos to be shared.

                <p>
                    We wanted to create an almost Instagram-like platform for people to share and rank other animal photos. Right now, users can create an account and start uploading photos.
