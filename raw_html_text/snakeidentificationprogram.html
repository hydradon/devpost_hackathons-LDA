                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a group based in Texas, and there are a lot of snakes here. We wanted to make a program available to help people identify snakes and if they were venomous.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program takes in user input of snake characteristics and accesses our database, searching for snakes matching the characteristics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Java program to get user input and call the command prompt to run the database file. The database file was created using s(ASP).
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use HTML to create a webpage to

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have accomplished our goals and contributed to the HACKAI hackathon.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about how s(ASP) works and a LOT about venomous snakes.

                    What's next for SnakeIdentificationProgram
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is to add more specifications and narrowing the matches down when many snake matches are made.
