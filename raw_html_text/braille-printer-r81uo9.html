                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose this project based on knowing that one of the judges are blind. There are several printers for blind people, but may they are too expensive, so we tried to create something helpful and easy at the same time. After we searched our topic, we found that there are a lot of amazing blind people that had created inventions to help others or even some blind programmer that used his code to create something different, we decide to do our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Braille printer takes sentences sent to the machine through text or just the UI and sends it to the printer which pokes holes that are noticeable to the touch, these holes create the letters that take the pattern of braille letters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After we did our research we brainstormed to decide how each part's going to work. We bought our materials from the Dollar store and borrowed some hardware from the university. The contraption is a cross between an ink gun and a 3d printer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many challenges such as finding the right materials as well as the correct algorithm to move in all axis. We're new to hardware builds so this added to the complexity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working prototype!
