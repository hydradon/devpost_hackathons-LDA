                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few months ago I came across my first image of a hypercube maze. I was already quite fascinated with many hyper cube mazes -- however this particular image had caught my attention. It wasn't long before I had already started to wonder how to procedurally generate something like a modified hyper cube maze.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I came to this hackathon without much of an idea, but I remember how I wanted to try my hand at implementing a game around mazes, and so -- here we are =)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an impromptu local multiplayer game with a casual twist -- procedurally generated "mazes".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built with Unity3D, GLSL and C#.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few VCS issues and a accodemts kist eatomg wotj a frome

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a successful MVP of a game idea in 36 hours and polish it to the point where it has a distinct style and personality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned quite a bit about procedural generation as well as the design aspects surrounded along with creating a procedurally generated game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hypermazed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to build Hypermaze for scale as an online web-game on it's own domain or partnered with a provider.
