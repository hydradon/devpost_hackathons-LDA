                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More than half of the world&rsquo;s population now live in urban areas. By 2050, that figure will have risen to 6.5 billion people &ndash; two-thirds of all humanity. Sustainable development cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our urban spaces. Problems need to be addressed as fast as possible. Here I tried to build a solution to report suspicious activities around cities, for example, vehicle or fire accidents and violence activities in cities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Detects suspicious activities from CCTVs videos (for example, vehicle or fire accidents and violence activities) and report to relevant users like city leaders, police, or nearby citizens (for public info like when there is an accident happened) with Facebook Messenger
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created Facebook page and Messenger. Then I created several Amazon Lambda functions to check if there is a new video uploaded to Amazon S3, then do several preprocessing tasks and use Amazon Rekognition to do the computer vision part. Then do several other tasks and send the result to Facebook Messenger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    User's privacy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every report generated will only be sent to relevant city leaders. City leaders can only access the relevant data from their CCTV. Citizens can get notified only for public information like car accidents and fire accidents. Citizens won't get notified for private data like the face of persons fighting, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Potential impact
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When this product installed in CCTVs, city leaders and police can address city issues faster, without the need to manually check CCTVs or wait to get complaints from the citizens, or for example, wait for a building to get burned into ashes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Diversity and inclusion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Crime rate faced by people with disability is 2.5 times more than the others. Up to 90% of women with disability have been sexually assaulted. Xave helps the assaulted people with disability by notifying the police faster, which means polices can find and help them faster. This is very significant especially for visually impaired people, which are often don't know who assaulted them.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>

                    What's next for Xave
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more features, there are so much information we can get from cities CCTV
