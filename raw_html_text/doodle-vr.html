                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to work with virtual reality and wanted to implement a game.  We decided on creating a VR Doodle game because we though it would be a fun challenge to create a two-dimensional game in a three-dimensional space.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you enter the game space, a tutorial level will demonstrate the basic actions.  In this tutorial, users will learn how to create weapons and objects to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies.  All the created objects can be grabbed and thrown.
