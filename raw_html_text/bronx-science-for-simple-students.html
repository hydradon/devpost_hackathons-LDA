                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our school's website but wanted to simplify it because it was hard to view
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website allows current bronx science students to easily access resources that are needed daily for them.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a webpage from scratch using css and html.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we ran into was putting all the components of our project together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a rookie team and some of us never took computer science, but we were able to complete the project in the given time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there were many aspects needed to complete a simple, functioning website. Furthermore, we learned that nothing is impossible because before we came, we thought we would never be able to create what we created, but we succeeded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bronx Science for Simple Students
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand our website by adding more components to it such as school events or current trending news involving our school.
