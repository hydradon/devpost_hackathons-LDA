                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that on a college student's list of priorities, taking care of your health is the last one. With busy schedules and back to back classes, college students deteriorate their health very quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created U+D H to help solve this problem. This program consolidates all health-related information on campus onto a website to help students when they get sick. Depending on the season and the campus, our "going on now" tab gives an idea to the students about what to watch out for. Additionally, emergency contacts for the ERs closest to campus are stated. We also started on functionality for a student to log in and track their health using the Google Calendar API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using angular.js and angular material.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges when implementing the GoodRX API to find the cheapest prices on prescriptions because GoodRX did not approve the request for a Client ID by the end of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned Angular or how to better navigate Angular to create a fully functioning application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UTD H
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is our plan to get U+D H to implement a cloud database for all of the people that opt into our program. We would like to get authenticated to use the GoodRX API to find the cheapest prices for over the counter and prescription medication in the area.
