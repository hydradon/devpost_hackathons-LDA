                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's easy to become caught up in our everyday lives and Western media and let the rest of the world fall into the background. We wanted to change that. MapMapp offers a clean and intuitive way for users to navigate across a map and explore various stories occurring in the world. Whether it's used as a morning brief or a daily catch up, we want to encourage everyone to become global citizens and become more cognizant of our world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MapMapp provides a map overlay that allows users to select a country and see a list of its top news events. It also offers keyword and category search filters to provide more precision and personalization to the browsing experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Angular, Express, and Node to create the webapp and used the Google Maps API and News API to retrieve data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the challenges we experienced pertained to inconsistent and unpredictable behavior with open-source packages and resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are quite proud of applying and tying together our collective and diverse web dev knowledge to overcome obscure issues and build this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Insomnia cookies are very tasty.

                <h2>
                    What's next for MapMapp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to replace the News API with our own scraper to allow for more flexibility with respect to the regions we can search and sources from which we are scraping. We would also like to improve to UI to create a more professional  and sleek experience.
