                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets users read normally, updating text outside their peripheral vision. This way, the next sentence is always ready when they want it, without distracting from the current sentence or causing motion sickness.
