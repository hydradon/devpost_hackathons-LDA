                    Inspiration: I was inspired by my work for the World Bank and observing how the international community prepares for and responds to disasters, including actuarily.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: This proposal provides not only for an AI-based disaster recovery system, but also for funding mechanisms that would spread risk, develop the US economy and provide for a Green New Deal
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: The app itself is not yet built, but a thorough plan for doing so, as well as coordinating federal and international authorities is included.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: None.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I'm extremely proud that the knowledge I gained while working at the World Bank Group on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action has applicability to solutions in disaster recovery, especially given my personal experience during the 1997 Oregon House-Dobbins Fire.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I learned that American disaster recovery efforts are woefully underfunded and that IC driven solutions can create wealth during the pre- and post-disaster periods, while also preventing abuses that would diminish the primacy of American democracy.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for From FEMA to FundUSA: Winning $45,000 from MD5 would allow Fabio Krishna Periera of The What Is Rhetoric Group to schedule a meeting and develop in more detail a FundUSA Plan of Action with the Pentagon and relevant authorities.
