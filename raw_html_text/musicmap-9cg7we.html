                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think it would be interesting to explore Spotify's database, as well as gather data on what songs people do in an area
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Authenticates with spotify
searches spotify's database for music and is able to play
                </p>
                <p>
                    authenticates with google for Firebase, 
updates the database on on what user is currently playing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Opens a google map with gps location of user, 
simulates other user's in area and is able to click on pins, placeholdes for song names and authors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android/Java/Firebase/Spotify Web API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran in
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Custom google maps/new authetication requirements for GPS/ using spotify API for our purpose as it is very limited.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Able to play songs from spotify, are really close to having a useful app that allows other people to see what others are listening to and gathering data in Firebase.
