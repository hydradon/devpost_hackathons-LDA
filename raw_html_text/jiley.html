                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to connect people though technology and music.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can upload a little clip of you singing/playing a tune, and others will sample it and add it to a bigger project. So every song is a remix of a previous one!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Adobe Muse because we don't have much experience with computer coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uploading it to domain.com has been our main roaadblock.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we felt like quitting, we continued and stayed up the entire night to create a project we're proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Adobe Muse, and how much work you must put into a project to achieve your goal.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on going to other hackathons and expanding on this project.
