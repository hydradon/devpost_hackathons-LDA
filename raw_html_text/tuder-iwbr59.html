                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many times, students struggle to find the perfect tutor. At the same time, tutors often struggle to find tutees that match their skill set. This web app was inspired by Tinder to find the solution to that problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app allows users to sign up and log in so that they can create a profile that would allow them to find compatible tutors/tutees using a like or dislike system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an HTML/CSS/JS front-end and an Express back-end. We used Google's Firebase for our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this project was the first time most of us created a web app, we were still learning the ins and outs of web development. As a result, we ran into numerous challenges. We had trouble properly routing. Then we had trouble connecting the database to our login and signup page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of being able to create the various pages and design of the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about how to use the various elements of HTML and CSS. We also learned how to code in javascript and how to use Express.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tuder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to successfully connect the database to the signup and login pages. Furthermore, we hope to implement a swiping feature, similar to Tinder, and a matching algorithm.
