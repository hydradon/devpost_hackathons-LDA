                    Social media has always been a place where people upload images of stray pets/animals hoping to get these poor animals back to their respective owners. Our intentions of having such an application is to consolidate these social efforts into a common place where responsible organizations such as SPCA can take charge of these stray animals/pets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application also aims to help find matches between lost claims posted by pet owners and kind strangers who happened to spot these animals near their vicinity. This project starts off focused on finding lost and stray animals but it  can also extended to other lost claims such as finding lost relatives in the case of dementia .etc.
