                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired through brainstorming of my Agora Video SDK (Web) Hackathon project which addressed communicating damage to customer service, the first step in the claims process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The insurance claims process is often confusing and not personable, resulting in drawn-out investigations with missing information and lack of communication. Insurance policy holders and claims adjusters currently do not have a common platform to share video evidence of car accident damage. Without live broadcasting capabilities, claims adjusters must physically visit a scene of an accident to gather more evidence and a partner repair shop to confirm that the repair was completed properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Unfazed helps all parties better engage in the claims process by providing video-sharing and live broadcasting functions.
                    </em>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfazed is a web-based checklist of what is needed from insurance policy holders to file a car accident claim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to input text-based information such as insurance policy information and utilize voice and video call to connect with police and record damage and other conditions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front End | HTML and CSS
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back End | Javascript, Agora Video SDK (Web), Agora Signaling SDK (Web)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, it was hard to integrate other SDKs other than Video since there were not many code samples for web-based apps. In particular, since code samples for the Voice Call SDK were only available for Android and IOS, I was unsure if I could integrate voice calling onto my web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to integrate the Video and Signaling SDKs into the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I further learned about more features of the Agora RTC API than previously during the Agora Video SDK Hackathon (Web). I improved my front-end skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Unfazed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to build more features to advance the project out of the prototype stage. I envision the app to be optimized for claims in the following insurance sectors:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            freight
                        </strong>
                        (Since the logistics industry usually does not use video technology to confirm damaged freight, repackaging, etc., manufacturers and claims adjusters must make costly decisions based only on text information)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            real estate
                        </strong>
                        (Due to the danger of examining dilapidated building structures, the real estate insurance companies can utilize drones with live broadcasting capabilities to assist with investigations).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
