                    The Wayfair API allows for really nice integration with A-Frame. Customizing your own room is great, but I wanted to make it slightly more fun. It would be really cool if there was something attached with customization. It was originally going to have a whole storyline, like you interact with specific pieces and then you can escape. Under the time constraints that wasn't chosen and so randomization was done.
