                    Scientific researchers use outdated interfaces to visualize and model their data, wasting time and money. We all miss out on innovative breakthroughs. NanoVR enables natural &amp; intuitive visualization, modeling and simulation in one application. It allows agile research workflows, precision testing and peer-reviewable accuracy. It runs on standard hardware, is easy (and fun) to learn, and was developed in partnership with UC San Diego and Scripps Research Institute.

                    Big Picture
Today nanotechnologies are also information and biotechnologies. The tools we use to design one are merging with the tools we use to design the others. NanoVR exemplifies this new generation of platform applications, letting different users --from laboratory professionals to science students- visualize, simulate, and most importantly design scientifically-accurate forms.
Like the telescope and the microscope, science advances in pace with the technologies that allow researchers visualize the world at otherwise impossible scales. VR will extend data visualization into and much more intuitive realm, and will close the loop between tools of analysis and tools of testing &amp; simulation.

                    For Laboratory Professionals
NanoVR was developed in La Jolla with UC San Diego and uses the image libraries of the Scripps Research Institute Molecular Graphics Laboratory. NanoVR will help advance any research that  depends on the visualization and comprehension of complex interactions at atomic and molecular scale. 
Studies show that VR can increase in the speed of pattern-finding are important if they mean increase in the quality of pattern-recognition and understanding.  It will be an increasingly indispensibe way of working with big data. The NanoVR platform provides a unique, cost-effective solution for nanobiosimulation software by combining multi-physics simulations with a complete 3D virtual interface and publication-ready data

                    For Education 
NanoVR is not just for scientists. Starting with the Table of Elements instead of the brick, anyone who can build in 3D for Minecraft can now make complex nanobiotechnological forms in VR. With NanoVR, anyone can see how the world works at this fundamental level. You can draw upon existing structures, based on the most accurate molecular imaging and geometries, or can start from scratch and build --atom-by-atom-- new proteins, molecules and simulate their interactions.

                    Development  Cycle and Market Targets
    NanoVR was founded in 2015, and today has a functional pre-beta version ready to demo. We currently project at $317mm SOM in just the first targeted market (Bio-nanosimulation). In the coming months, features targeted for pharmaceutical discovery, semiconductor design and nanomaterials engineering will be available: a Biological Design Suite, a Cross-Material Design Suite and a Multi-scale Physics Simulation platform.
