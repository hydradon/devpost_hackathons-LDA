                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed ideas and I like NLP. Also other idea generators don't really take into account the skills on a team, the challenges and what you want out of a hackathon. Which really was a problem for my team in particular.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using domain level knowledge about the types of challenges available, and the type of project, skills of the team and online ideas build a natural language representation suggestion. AKA "I know Java, PHP and a bit of HTML and the challenge is use Google's API's and I want to learn something new" -&gt; "Implement Google Scholar in C++" or "Try out Google's new Vision API in Java"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mainly built in my downtime for doing frontend work for the main project. Currently exists as notes on paper and an algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a reason the NLP community uses models and data/text mining techniques.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to make it work, I got a good start on the algorithm but ran out of time to implement it. It would also be nice to get some training data and build up some models instead of the rather basic idea. It also needs a catchy and slick name.
