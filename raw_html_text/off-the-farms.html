                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest inspiration was to create a unique idea which benefited the local community as well as encourage gardening.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with this unique idea that we would sell seeds to local families and they would grow the fresh produce right from their backyard and sell it through our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Website using Wordpress with woo commerce.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge for us was to narrow down on a single idea that is feasible and doable within 24 hours whilst making sure that it does not already exist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of working in a team who all belong is different departments and bringing in their specialities to work on this project. We are also proud about creating a very professional, fully operational website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management is the key to success. We should be able to manage our time more efficiently. Trying new stuff in groups is also fun.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Depending on how the market research gives results, we may look forward to creating this into a live business.
