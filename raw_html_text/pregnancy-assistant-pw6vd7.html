                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a skill that pregnant women can use everyday. We wanted to create something that guides them through their entire pregnancy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pregnancy assistant can help pregnant women in different ways.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Provide useful pregnancy updates and tips
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Recommend healthy food recipes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Suggest useful yoga exercises they can do at home
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The skill is available in the Amazon Alexa Skill Store as "Pregnancy Assistant".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have build the assistant using Node.js, Wit.ai and AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have build one of the most intelligent skills for Alexa with very sophisticated natural language capabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pregnancy Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step is to further develop the skill, add more dialogs and cover more topics. We are also going to extend our database with recipes, yoga exercises and useful tips.
