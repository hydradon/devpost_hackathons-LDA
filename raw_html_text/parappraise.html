                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As graduating seniors, our class is looking to start our new chapter in life in different areas of the world. Our goal was to simplify the selection process in an efficient and smart way. We used a data set provided by CoStar from Apartments.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a Machine Learning algorithm, we are able to predict the prices of an apartment in a specific area (DC Metro Area) based on specific criteria. Using our model, we can find the best value of an apartment listed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a front end visualization to represent the data in the data set based on geolocation. This visualization allows users to interact with each data point in order to see the minimum and maximum rent prices of each listing. 
In the back end, we pre-processed the data set and used dense neural networks.
