                    We had found that users of our skills are the same audience of people who play crosswords, we give people such as those who struggle with written puzzles or the visually impaired the ability to solve crosswords.

                    Players can solve crosswords using their voice, Alexa will read you the

                    </em>
                    and then you will be given some time to think about the answer, you can Interrupt at any time with "Alexa,

                    All players have access to these utterances:

                    We give free users a new 5 by 5 crossword every day to solve, we select a crossword from our data set based on the day of the year. Alexa will then ask you the clues from the crossword, for example "Break out of an egg, 5 letters". The user just has to shout out the answer to the clue.

                    To create the structure of the project we used the Alexa Skills Kit CLI.
We used Amazons S3 storage for all our in-game assets such as images and audio.
We used an SQL server database to store our user settings.
We used a voice over artist to be the "host" and then used Alexa to handle our dynamic speech content such as asking questions.

                <p>
                    Due to the vast amount of answers in our interaction model, we found that there was a lot of times where an utterance would be confused for something else. For example, "Hatch" vs "Patch". This would mean that in some instances a player could never get an answer right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created a Fuzzy matching algorithm which was modelled around using the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance" rel="nofollow">
                        Levenshtein distance
                    </a>
                    . The algorithm will take two strings: the correct answer and the user utterance, calculate the "distance" (the similarity of the strings) and then return a % match, if the % match was high enough then we would assume the user meant the correct answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We found that for smaller words we needed to have a more aggressive algorithm, since an 80% match on a 3-letter word would always be the entire word!

                <p>
                    We are especially proud of the way we developed the APL for this skill. We dynamically generate a crossword grid based off our data set.
We start off by drawing a grid in APL and then map certain values to each square in the grid, here's an example of the way a clue data is processed to use with APL:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        { "id": 1,
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        "start": 1,
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        "dir": 0,
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        "num": 1,
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        "answer": "BAP",
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        "clue": "Bread bun",
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        "clueDisplay": "Bread bun",
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    <code>
                        "answerLength": "3"},
                    </code>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    From this we can extrapolate that:
                    <br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The clue starts from square 1 (start: 1)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Has a number 1 in square 1: (num: 1)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Is in the across direction (dir:0)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Goes to square 3 (answerLength: 3)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We repeat this process for all the clues, leaving us an array of values which can be mapped to the structure of the grid, leaving us the correct crossword view.
                </p>

                    We have learnt how to hone our upsell process. When we handed the skill to our testing team, we discovered the upsell process to be quite abrasive, because of this, we have developed an algorithm to calculate placement and frequency of the upsell offers based on metrics calculated from our player data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We found that lots of users natural speech for solving crosswords is different to how we anticipated, for example, people wouldn't just say "Answer", they would instead say "Is the answer to five across 'Answer'?", this has allowed us to think about in more depth for future skills, and create a wider range of potential utterances for a given intent.
