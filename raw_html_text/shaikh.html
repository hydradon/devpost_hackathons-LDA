                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was Saqib Shaikh, a software engineer at Microsoft who also happens to be hard of sight. In order to write code, he used a text-to-speech engine that would read back what he wrote. That got us thinking: how do other visually impaired individuals learn how to code and develop software? What if there were not only text-to-speech plugins, but also speech-to-text plugins? That became the basis of our project, Shaikh.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shaikh takes in a speech input, either through your device's built-in microphone or an Amazon Echo. Sample inputs include: "declare a variable named x and initialize it to 0," or "declare a for loop that iterates from 1 to 50." Alexa will then translate these requests into the appropriate syntax (in this case, Python), and send this to the server. From the server, we make a GET request from our extension in VS Code and insert this code snippet into our text editor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Amazon Echo to take in speech input. Additionally, we used Google Cloud services to host our server and StdLib in order to connect the endpoints of our HTTP requests. Our backend was mostly done in Javascript (Node.js, typed.js, AJAX, jQuery, as well as Typescript). We used HTML/CSS/Javascript for our website demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since there were so many components to our project, we had issues integrating the backend portion together cohesively. In addition, we had some difficulties with the Amazon Echo, since it was our first time using it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built something super cool! This was our first time working with Alexa and we're excited to integrate her technology into future hacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Alexa, the difference between a JAR and a runnable JAR file was, language models, integrating all the backend together, Kern's juice, how long we could stay awake without sleeping.

                <p>
                    Using Stack Overflow's API to catch errors and suggest/implement changes, expand to other code editors,
