                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by blockchain's ability to transfer non-physical assets without monetized currency integrated with each transaction
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It models the transactions implicit in a photography agency supply chain
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built with the IBM Hyperledger Composer
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drew: I'm more familiar with development rather than the DevOps aspect of these projects, and preparing the infrastructure of the composer environment was a challenge.
Ben: I have never touched Hyperledger before and had to face a big learning curve in using a blockchain for the first time. 
Both: In addition, Hyperledger's tutorial documentation was rather poor. We had to do a massive amount of trial-and-error while developing the script and refining the model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The transactions of photo assets and rights triggered several "Ah Hah!" moments during development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ben: I learned many of the basics of development with the Hyperledger blockchain, including how to process the transactions, trigger notifications, and update registries.
Drew: I learned how to handle asynchronous Javascript access calls better, and how to emit and consume notifications.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presenting a UI with more robust API calls, and distributing a sample application from a public GitHub repository.
