                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make it easier to transmit information from your computer to your phone. Sometimes, when we find something on the internet and want to take a note or memo of it, it would be good if we can send those content directly to your phone and keep it with you everywhere. A good example is that you find a good recipe online while you are at home and want to go grocery shopping. You can just clip that recipe and then send it to your phone through our Note To Phone!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So whenever you see something while web surfing, you can clip the text and images and send to your phone. This way you can carry the info you found everywhere with your phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Javascript, HTML and CSS on both client side and server side. On the server, we also used express.js and deploy it through ngrok. Finally we distribute the client side as chrome extension package so that it is available to everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time working with Twilio and chrome extension. We are also not that familiar with Javascript. So it is really challenging to build the pipeline and debug it. Also, our initial design required new users to download Twilio packages but we did not that since it would make it less accessible so we had to re-implement and new design, where there is a server in between the client and Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to complete the project. We were all good team players and distribute tasks well. We are also able to learn something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build a chrome extension with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We also learned how to use Twilio API. We also learned about how to build a server to handle requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Note-To-Phone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make the server more robust so that it will be able to handle more requests. We also want to make it more user friendly.
