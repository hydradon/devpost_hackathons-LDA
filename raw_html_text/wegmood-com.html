                    We were truly inspired by the both the Wegman's and the GCP APIs and all that they had to offer, especially for each other. We decided to delve into the realm of web design to build WegMood.com!!!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We planned to combine GCP's facial recognition software to gauge the emotion of a user, check that rating against our "emotion library" with correlated foods, then use those entries to search the Wegman's API and display several recommended projects.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We built the back end of this website using GCP's wrapper functions, as well as the python module, Flask. Our main page is HTML with our own custom style sheet. All images on the page are made by our resident graphical design expert with an emphasis on health and happiness, two things we all associate with Wegmans.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    All of us are first time hackers. We all have limited programming experience, so we ran into issues we have never seen before. One issue in particular was configuring the web server to work with Python. We used Python because it is the language we are most comfortable with, but it is not the best for web design. I would say our inexperience kept this project from releasing a full website.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We are all very proud of each other's efforts and dedication throughout the entire event, and I am personally very proud of all of the skills that we learned in just these short (seemingly extremely long) 24 hours. I know we will all go on to become competent hackers, and maybe come to host a hackathon ourselves one day.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned a lot in particular about Web design and communication between different files and servers on the web. This includes good graphical design, as well as back-end design. We also learned a lot about how different foods correspond to different emotions.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Becoming a working website!!! After its release, some potential improvements include voice commands and emotion recognition through voice, a user log-in, extended results, more in-depth search parameters and requirements, favorites lists, and many more!!!
