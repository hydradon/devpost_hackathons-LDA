                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were talking about random things at the beginning of the hackathon and came up with a toast catapult that evolved into the Toastomatic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a device that launches and jams toast for the user to enjoy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it utilizing scrap plywood as a frame with a pulley system to flip the toaster as necessary. Electronics wise we utilized the Arduino 101 and 5 servos to move the toast and spread jam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a variety of challenges including issues with our IOT Hardware (ESP 8266), mechanical system failure, and lack of adequate tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this out of scrap plywood and it is function-able. Also our jelly squeezer is made of Red Bull cans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Arduino programming and the creative usage of tools to accomplish and task.
