                <p>
                    FB Messenger is the most popular messaging platform in the world. As active FB Messenger users, we wanted to build an app that makes messaging more fun and productive. There are certain situations that you want to check your messages, but looking at the screen is inconvenient:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        At work place, constantly checking Facebook is not acceptable (Unless you work at Facebook).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While studying, switching browser tabs just to check single message is annoying.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Driving, reading messages impairs reduces ability to drive.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    And the list goes on. We wanted to create an app that reads out new Facebook messages to us, so that we don't have to look at screen to get update. MessageMumbler allows us to listen to the updates in real time and react to the ones that are important to you.

                    MessageMumbler extracts new messages from your Facebook messenger and reads them for you.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created chrome extension, which uses DOM to extract message data from main Facebook website.
After extracting the message data, we figured out which messages are recent and who are the senders.
We set up a nodejs server that sends text to Microsoft Oxford and return speech of the text. 
The extension takes the returned audio file from the server and plays the speech.
                </p>
                <h2>
