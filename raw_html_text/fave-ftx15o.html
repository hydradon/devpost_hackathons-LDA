                    We aim to solve the  problem of enabling users to communicate gender-based violent actions being perpetrated on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some people can never accept being abused so never open up using conventional language as a means of communication. There are others like kids or physically challenged people who might not be able to express themselves, so we are targeting such users to use drawing as the primary means of expression. Bringing life in any form is a hopeful endeavor and our goal was to integrate emojis, photos, videos, art, stick figures, etc to help victims tell their story and report it artistically. This could potentially help people overcome the barriers of stigmas/shame attached to &ldquo;talking&rdquo; about their abuse, not be afraid of further threats to their person since every thought of art is different!
We have created a very limited form of the project today in the hopes that we can take it further with building analysis tools of such art of reporting to help people navigate their hurtful past.
