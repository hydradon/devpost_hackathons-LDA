                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an AR app, and we decided on a game because we were inspired by simplistic but fun games such as Gang Beasts and Totally Accurate Battle Simulator.
                </p>

                    The user fights versus endless amounts of soldiers and tries to get a high score. The user can add troops to their side by spending mana.

                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Unity Engine and the ARCore framework by Google.

                <p>
                    We ran into some merging issues with GitHub, and sometimes our work was slowed or deleted because of it.
