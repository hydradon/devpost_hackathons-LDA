                    Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ingo is a smart voice assistant based on Google Assistant and is aiming towards simplifying communication between local governments and citizens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the hackathon, we developed a voice assistant which helps users report vandalism in their community.

                    To get you a better idea of what we have been building for these past few days, please have a look at these prepared slides:

                    </a>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Also, please note, that we will be submitting 2 prototypes!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a non-technical prototype to illustrate both our unique user-centric features and the business value behind Ingo. It will be the central part of our pitch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, we would like to submit a technical-driven prototype (see link above)! We are excited to share the progress we have made!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is next?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the "Hackadon" to kickstart an idea. After 1 weekend of hard and dedicated work, we are more excited and proud of the product we are building. Therefore, we are definitely looking forward to pursuing it more further.
