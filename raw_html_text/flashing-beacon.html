                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the TV show The Flash when he accidentally turns his suit into a flotation device. We figured this very concept could have a real life application to save civilian and military lives
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A regular run of the mill jacket, turns into a flotation device when completely submerged in water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Placing Anhydrous Citric Acid and Sodium Bicarbonate in a plastic pouch between the layers of what would be a jacket which are activated when submerged in water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming the bluetooth into it. (We dont have much experience programming). Getting the right ergonomics for the plumber putty to reseal the water gate.

                <p>
                    We found a non-bulky way to make a new life jacket in the simplest of ways.
