                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came to nwHacks with the common goal to hack a scalable application for social good. As a group who has had their fair share of experiences working alongside children with special needs, we tried our best to identify ways that we could enhance and support their learning, in ways that the traditional education system could not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Problems we tackled include:

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        Traditional paper documents don't record all necessary information needed for the future teachers to ease students into the adjustment process
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data should be inputted by both teachers and parents
