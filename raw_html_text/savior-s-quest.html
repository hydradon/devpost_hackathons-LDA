                    I saw this great game online, and I was like oh man this is a good game. Then I emailed the creator and was like "Hey what language did you use to code this game" and he was a nice guy and responded "C# with Unity". So I was like wow that good of a game using such a coding language, oh boy I wanna do it too. So I did. And Julia, Julian, and other Julia helped by doing more of the project than i did ironically.
