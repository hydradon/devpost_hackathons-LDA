                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team noticed that most young adults do not understand finances or have experience applying their skills, and resources that teach general financial concepts are not engaging. We believe that the best way to learn is through an experience, so we decided to implement a virtual reality(VR) solution to help increase young adult's financial literacy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Virtual VRality personalizes the experience to our target user, young adults with a source of income, and aims to create realistic experiences that the person can extrapolate to their actual life. Although there are many crucial financial skills, we decided to focus on savings in our prototype because 63% of Americans do not know how to save money according to research. In the prototype, the user sets a 5-month goal (buying a laptop) and undergoes the process of opening a savings account, making decisions like saving or going to a concert, and finding out if they saved enough for their goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unreal-Engine, iclone, and character-creator to create the scenery, characters, and interactions in the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out the best way to collaborate on Unreal Engine, so we could track one another's changes. To resolve the solution, we all worked on different levels using the same assets, so we could easily merge the levels together as we finished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every aspect of our experience was ideated by and created by one of our team members. The team created all characters, environments, camera movements, interactive objects, and graphics. Most of our members were new to Unreal Engine, so we're proud that we were able to learn and apply a new skill in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I became more knowledgeable in how savings accounts work and the 50-30-20 rule as well as how to use the Unreal Engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Financial VRality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Financial VRality will start to implement critiques received during the hackathon and add more scenarios to the savings module. Ultimately, we hope to release Financial VRality as a FREE resource that can be used by anyone with a phone.
