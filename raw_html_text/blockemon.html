                    A card game built on top of the blockchain for learning purposes (the blockchain serves as a simple database for cards and transactions). A light weight blockchain with rudimentary Proof of Work (POW). This is not a secure implementation and not meant for the public. It is merely a simple implementation that allows you to enter data into blocks. This project was based on

                    Features
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Ensure you are signed in for everything!
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you sign up, you are awarded 5 ecoins to freely create cards as you please. If you successfully mine the next block, you are awarded 50 ecoins. If you create a card, you spend 1 ecoin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creating cards is simple, head over to the create a card page, fill out the form and press create. The server will broadcast a message to all the nodes connected and will attempt to mine the next block. The block contains data such as the card information, and any transactions made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also view all the nodes connected, however, this is a manual process. All nodes must connect to one main client in order for this to work properly. Additionally, you can view the mined blocks on the home page, which shows the blockchain details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a visual aid, you can view the cards that exist on the blockchain on the cards page. This visual representation of the blockchain is a fun way to learn how the blockchain gets created.

                    Idea
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Mainly, this was developed for learning purposes, however, you could imagine a system where people want to develop a card game that is decentralized and crowd sourced. There could be a review process for cards to become created, and a store to use the currency.
