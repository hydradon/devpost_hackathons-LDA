                    One in 68 U.S. children has an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a 30% increase from 1 in 88 two years ago, according to a new report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is a growing demand for affordable and safe education providers for families with children diagnosed with ASD.

                    Instructional strategies are applied and implemented in the same way on a regular basis. This helps the child predict what will happen next and increases the probability of their success.
