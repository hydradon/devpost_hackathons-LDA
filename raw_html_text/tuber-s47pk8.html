                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google maps is cool, but it could be cooler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives alternate modes of transport along with energy expended, time spent, and style points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of google apis!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web formatting is hard and so is learning a new language (javascript) in 12 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website runs without failing and actually does exactly what we told it to do!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript is a beautiful and effective language. Also I learned exactly what an api is and how it can be used in personal projects!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tuber
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiple modes of transport for a given journey, ranking travel modes by travel time or energy or style points, etc, prettying up the map.
