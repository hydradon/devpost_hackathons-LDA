                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Staying motivated while exercising is hard, so we play our favorite jams to get us through a jog. However, its really easy to simply stop and walk during a run, and not gain the real benefits of a workout. What if there was an app that made you run to hear your favorite songs?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this app, you play your favorite music playlists from Spotify while you run. You also set the pace and amount of time you want to run for. If you begin to slow down your pace during this time period, the app will begin to warp your music. It'll begin to play music you hate, anything from country music to screamo to classical music. In order to stop the awful music, you have to run faster and then maintain your initial pace for the set amount of time. It's simple!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Xcode. We had one person work on UI/UX and the framework of the overall app. Another person worked on figuring out the Spotify API and how to integrate the Spotify Login into our app, so we could access the user's playlists. Then two people worked with figuring out how to integrate the playlists into our interface using the Spotify API and how to track the user's pace through a GPS mapping system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the Spotify API into our app proved to be the most challenging part. Since our app revolved around the API working, we spent a lot of time debugging the Spotify Login page, and figuring out how to actually take data from Spotify and put it into our app. Therefore, we didn't have time to handle making the account system of Hamster, and we didn't have much time to work on the mapping system.
