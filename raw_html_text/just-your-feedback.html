                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested in developing a product with machine learning and utilizing the SurveyMoneky API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web application accepts an image using a computer webcam and detects whether someone gives a thumbs up or a thumbs down and sends this information to SurveyMonkey through an API call.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created our product using Python along with the ImageAI library to create a custom machine learning model for the purposes of our project. We then created a web server using Pyramid to showcase our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were several challenges we tackled. First of all, learning how to use the ImageAI library to create a custom model for thumbs up and thumbs down was quite difficult. We also had difficulty setting up the web server with Pyramid and sending data between the back-end processes with the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a working product in under 36 hours that utilizes technology that none of us were not familiar with before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create custom image classifying models with ImageAI and how to set up a server with Pyramid.

                    What's next for Just Your Feedback
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve our image recognition algorithm so that it can detect more hands in a larger crowd of people
