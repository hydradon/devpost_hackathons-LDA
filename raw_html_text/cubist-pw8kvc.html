                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I develop software for the logistics industry and am involved with mailrooms and transport companies where cubing is currently done with a tape measure. I recently became interested in 3D printing and realised that an electronic device would be a much faster solution for cubing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cubist uses the camera on your smartphone or tablet in combination with a distance sensor to measure the dimensions of a surface and calculate cubic measurements. It is simple to use, affordable &amp; ultra portable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The body of the device has been built using a 3D printer, the electronics components are based on Arduino and the device runs using software built with Javascipt and HTML5.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calibrating the lens has been difficult. It has also been hard to get the electronics to fit into the case. Onscreen measurement has also been a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking the idea and converting it into a physical product within a tight time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The finer aspects of 3D printing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cubist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This version of Cubist is a hand held unit that will be miniaturised. The product will then be expanded to include a desktop version that will be integrated with scales and additional sensors that will allow the user to place a parcel on the scales where it will be weighed and cubed simultaneously.
