                    One of the Shepherd teammates is on the San Francisco Neighborhood Emergency Response Team and has volunteered on American Red Cross' Disaster Relief Teams. Furthermore, several of the Shepherd teammates had family members affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

                    We are passionate about helping those impacted by a natural disaster.

                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Shepherd saves lives by helping independent rescuers more easily find those in need and get them to safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a natural disaster strikes, rescuers rise to the occasion to help victims in need. There are often many people in need of emergency help, which makes it challenging to organize these help efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge is that not everyone impacted in such a disaster has a smartphone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Shepherd, stranded victims can send a text message to our network requesting help. In that text message, a victim can specify the address of his or her current location and the number of people who need help at that location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This request gets submitted to our network of independent rescuers. Using the Shepherd app, rescuers tell us their vehicle type and capacity. Based on their location, the Shepherd network identifies victims that need their help and maps out the best route to help them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the event that victims are in areas where cell phone towers are not functional, Shepherd has a phone number that landline users can dial. They will be connected with a volunteer who can then submit the victim's request for help to the network.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The Accenture team, Mapquest team, and Nexmo team helped make Shepherd possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shepherd has a web app and iOS app. We used the following technologies:
Objective-C
.NET
C#
Mapquest API
Nexmo API
Bootstrap
Heroku
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used the Mapquest API to display victims' locations, rescuers locations, and optimal routes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used the Nexmo API to allow victims to text their requests for help to our network.
