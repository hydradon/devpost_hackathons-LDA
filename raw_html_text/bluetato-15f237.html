                <p>
                    Bluetato lets a group of strangers who don&rsquo;t know anything about each other interact by provoking them to ask various questions without the embarrassment of asking it in person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Game is divided into Setup and Asking stages:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        During the Setup stage participants enter their anonymous questions into a common question pool
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During the Asking stage a random question is chosen and one person has to address it to another participant of their choice
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Participants are pressed to give a satisfying answer in as short time span as possible
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The person who read the question decides when the answer is complete enough and stops the timer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Failure to answer by the time limit results in losing a life
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Time limit is progressively shortened
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The quiz game continues until there is only one person left

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was to connect the pieces: backend and frontend were developed independently and wiring their bidirectional communication caused a lot of issues. Our developed frontend and backend to support multiple groups playing simultaneously.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing our own micro framework using Vanilla routing and managing an asynchronous environment with a socket connection between our front-end and back-end.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavasScript frameworks are there for a reason
                </p>
                <p>
                    CORS is adding safety but makes our life difficult
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't choose a Cloud Service just because everyone else is using it

                    Having fun at the Hackathon is the most important thing and 24 hours is not a lot.
