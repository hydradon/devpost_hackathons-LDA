                        ##Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    Our inspiration for the project stemmed from the fact that everyone in our group were self-described introverts. Thus, we wanted to make an app that would be a comprehensive database event listings that people could attend if they so wish to do so. The name Evencial came from combining the words "Event" and "Social."
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        ## What it does
                    </strong>
                    The app lets people sign in through Facebook, therein automatically integrating one's Facebook profile into their Evencial profile. They can then find events through 3 settings: University, Local, and Private. University events are, ideally, events one can only find after registering and signing up with their official university ID. The events would also be only created by university officials. Local events are events that can be found around you within a certain mile radius that you assign. Private events are events that users can create and invite their friends where no other people would be able to find these events unless they were also invited. Moreover, there is a Search feature for people to find events based on categories, such as Hackathons, music festivals, and other functions. The app also has the feature of showing the user a map with pinpoints that indicate ongoing events near them in the area. They can also set privacy settings on the app where only friends that send them requests, which they accept, will be able to see them and their profile on the app. This app lets people connect and follow their friends and favorite celebrities to whichever event they choose to go to. It allows people to go out of their comfort zone and make friends. Not only does this app help people, but it is also philanthropic in the sense that people can find charity events to attend and volunteering events to join. A fun feature about the app is that, when people join, they have the choice to make their profile picture as an animal. As the person attends more and more events, they will automatically be upgraded to older versions of the animal. An example of this, and our personal favorite, is when a person starts out as a caterpillar. As they attend more events, they eventually become a "social butterfly." In addition to the aforementioned option, another feature is the ability to earn badges and stickers as people attend more events and host them. Finally, and perhaps most
                    <strong>
                        importantly
                    </strong>
                    , the uniqueness of the app is encompassed by the fact that it is tailored specifically to the user. The app, once the user is registered, asks them to take a short survey to subsequently suggest events to the user based on interest. The app will gather data on the user throughout the course of the app's use to suggest more accurate and interesting events. It will, additionally, send notifications to the user regarding said interesting events. The target demographic for this app circumscribes all ages since people at all stages of life can use this app.The overall encompassing goal of the app is to connect people, regardless of age, to events that interest them where they can also meet people that share the same interest in an easy and efficient manner through the use of this app.

                        ## How we built it
                    </strong>
                    We built the app using
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            Ionic
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    and our skills in
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            Java

                    ,

                        <em>

                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    , and
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            CSS

                    </strong>
                    . Skills we taught ourselves over the past 2 days include Ionic, how to use Angular JavaScript, and learning about APIs.

                        ## Challenges we ran into
                    </strong>
                    The biggest challenge of the app was having it connect to Facebook through the login feature.

                    <strong>
                        ## Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </strong>
                    Although we did not manage to fully integrate the app with Facebook, we did manage to get the login feature of Facebook to show up on the app, which was a big accomplishment for us. Making the whole app, in a sense, was also an accomplishment since this was the first time that the people in our group collaborated to make an app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        ## What we learned
                    </strong>
                    We learned that making an app is a multi-step process that involves a lot of forethought. We also learned more about Ionic, the Facebook API, Angular JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. She Innovates helped us improve on our communication skills with each other, and we managed to create an app due to this.

                        ## What's next for Evencial
                    </strong>
                    We plan to complete making Evencial so that it can become its own app and be sent into the market for general usage. We would have to fix any problems with it and improve the app visually. Our ultimate goal is to connect people who do not usually go outside and attend public gatherings, and we also wish to connect people that hope to help the community and bring them together.
