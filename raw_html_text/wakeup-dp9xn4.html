                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yeah, we're college students and we're late to class more often than we like. But we also have awesome friends and roommates we can rely on! Why not let your friends wake you up if you can't do so yourself?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WakeUp is an app that lets your friends and roommates (if you have any) wake you up if you fail to get up after your alarm. This Android app functions initially as an alarm. After a certain amount of time (we set it to 10 seconds but could be set to longer), a dialogue box will appear, asking the user if they are still awake. If the user taps "No" or does not respond, the app will prompt you to text as many of your friends/roommates as you want by entering their phone number and the message you want them to receive. The texting process also helps you snap out of grogginess by forcing you to pay attention to a task at hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, our (very) limited knowledge of Java, and lots of consultations to the Android development manual and Stack Overflow to program the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our entire team is only halfway through our first semester of introductory computer science, and our previous programming experiences (for those of us who had any) were negligible. With the lack of experience, everything about programming in Android Studio under a tight timeline was challenging when considered as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting this app to even function was an accomplishment we're extremely proud of. More specifically, we managed to implement auto texting from an Android device, which was something we never thought we were able to do in two days. Oh and we also figured out the basics of Android Studio, which will inevitably be helpful in future app development endeavours. Also, we conquered our first hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are much more familiar with Android Studio and have a much better idea of what development in the real world looks like. Programming in our intro computer science class is so vastly different that this almost everything in this experience of making an app was new. We ran into countless problems, and learned to improvise, adapt, and continue under times when we felt way too lost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WakeUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can definitely refine our database system to allow more entries to be added and contacted. UI is also another element we can figure out, refine, and have fun with if we had more time.
