                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In many cities, it is really exhausting to park a car. Like many other people, we hate searching for a parking space for 50 minutes - or longer. ParkMyCar is our new system providing a smart framework supporting  a web- and mobile app for solving this parking issue. With ParkMyCar, the most enhanced technologies (IoT, satellite imaging, and accurate localization, etc.) can be integrated. Based on our solution, a promising global business model can be established.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the mobile app, the user can choose an area of interest, and see how many parking slots are there. Instead of driving around to find a parking slot, our mobile app directly shows the various options one has: public parking space, charged parking houses, etc. The app does not show only free parking slots, but it also informs about prices and maximum allowed parking duration. 
Car drivers will also be possible to book a parking space in charged parking houses. This opportunity enables the parking house owner to set the prices dynamically; like airline companies sell tickets for different prices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we monetize our work
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have different options to do so. The app will show some advertisements which can be removed for premium users. In the future, there will be even more monetize options. 1) We could charge a brokerage for parking payments in charged parking houses. 2) Car manufacturers could include our parking system in their self-driving cars. 3) Information about the user's interests (Facebook, etc.) will enable showing fitted advertisement in places where the user is going to park. 4) Cooperations with other transportation services such as Uber, Taxi, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The information about free parking slots is collected from our IoT-based prototype that includes several sources such as sensors and video cameras. Additional information from statistical records and external APIs (Embers, ESA, etc.) has being set up. The communication is over our secure and trustable network; encryption and authentication are done in the wireless IoT sensors. The web service is hosted on Microsoft Azure, and the mobile app is programmed platform independent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    .) Car detection
.) Video Processing
.) Embers API integration
.) Converting web application to mobile application
.) Fit the en- and decryption all together with the authentication algorithm to the resource-limited IoT hardware
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have completed the first prototype of the entire IoT system - from the sensor node to the user service - in this short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of the various fields, team building, and focusing on main requirements.
Especially about:
1) new APIs provided by the partners
2) object detection
3) encryption and decryption
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ParkMyCar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Develop a fully-working system. 
2) Deploy the beta version of the framework for different mobile vendors.
3) Enhance our business model and draw investments.
4) Use information about free parking slots from self-parking cars (they scan parking slots while driving by).
5) Use statistical information from images from ESA satellites.
