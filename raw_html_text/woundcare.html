                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration for this app was as a medical student at UMKC I found that it would be helpful for patients have a way to know whether or not their wound was infected or not. WoundCare allows for that to be a possibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app does it through the frontend using Xcode and the backend using CustomVision software
                </p>

                    I ran into challenges integrating the CustomVision ML with my actual xcode app.
