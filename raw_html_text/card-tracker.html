                <p>
                    Walking into MHacks 6, our team wanted to stretch our knowledge of
                    <strong>
                        machine vision
                    </strong>
                    while utilizing Capital One's redesigned API
                    <em>
                        fresh off the stack
                    </em>
                    .  Interestingly 
enough, we came across a
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/needadebitcard" rel="nofollow">
                        philipino twitter account
                    </a>
                    that mockingly retweets others' postings with exposed debit card information under the credo:
                    <em>
                        need a debit card?
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that online banking and transactions are commonplace, we cannot afford to let one mistake compromise a user's 
account.  This technology isn't a consumer-ready application as much as a potential service for financial institutions 
to
                    <strong>
                        help combat fraud
                    </strong>
                    .  Fraud costs banks heavily in time, money, and personel- not to mention
                    <strong>
                        reputation
                    </strong>
                    -
and that isn't even considering how hard the victim has to stomach it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our service simply offers banking instutions

                    </em>
                    by beating malicious hackers to the source.
