                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ve noticed that many people are keen to recycle but are unsure as to how to properly dispose of each different material
                </p>
                <p>
                    Often, we think that we are helping the environment when, in reality, our contributions cannot be counted due to our incorrect disposal methods
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also realised that some people may feel that they are the only ones trying to make a difference and this can be very disheartening
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recycling should be something fun so we wanted to add a competition element to our solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to create a way for users to scan packaging material and learn how to properly recycle it
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst doing this, users can also see their nearest recycling centres should they need to visit one
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also thought that a good way to create a sense of community (in a novel way) would be to allow users to see how many people have scanned a similar item in their postcode
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to extend this functionality in order to gamify our solution. Users can view a leaderboard to see which city is currently recycling the most. This encourages a playfully competitive spirit whilst saving the planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we wanted to make our solution as accessible and user-friendly as possible so we have implemented the programmable MMS functionality via WhatsApp using Twilio. Users can text a photo of a material and receive a response detailing how to recycle it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Azure Cloud, Python, Twilio, Flask, WhatsApp API, Google Maps APIs, ngrok, JavaScript
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Integrating Twilio with WhatsApp due to security limitations from WhatsApp side
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrating Python scripts that use Azure with Twilio
                    </li>

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We were able to use the skills we gained from the Microsoft workshop to leverage Microsoft Azure within our project; both for training our data model and for deploying our website
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We managed to link our Python functionality to Twilio
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Prior to this hackathon, only one member of our team had worked in Python. Learning Python and Flask on the fly has helped us hone our programming and adaptive skills
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LitterBug
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We can see LitterBug expanding in multiple direction, we would love to be able to attach our server to raspberry pi with a webcam. The goal of this would be to attach this to bins so that members of the public could 'scan' their rubbish and see if it is eligible for recycling
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another idea that we had was to add the functionality of scanning multiple items at once (e.g. after a party) to see what can be recycled
                    </li>
