                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To find a creative yet effective solution to online harassment

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This browser plug-in/extension replaces harassing posts/messages with silly words and pictures to reduce the harm on internet victims by showing them a nonsensical, goofy version of the harassment intended to irritate the victim.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We summoned the mightiest internet paladins of the feline realm to come in aid us in fighting our issue of internet harassment in exchange for copious amount of catnip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A prototype was constructed in Java by pulling a post from a .txt and executing an algorithm to
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            Sillify
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    the harassers post to the victims client side, reducing the harmful effects caused by cyber-harassment. The program was then ported to JavaScript to streamline accessibility browsers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge was creating an algorithm that only targets certain words to modify within the text post

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The aspect of this program that we are most proud of is creating a piece of software that does not harm either the victim nor the bully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a lightweight extension that can easily be installed on anyone's browser to promote ease of use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cats Against Bullying
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to incorporate some sort of way to enable the extension on the client side bully's computer to stupefy the harasser and discourage further provocation.
