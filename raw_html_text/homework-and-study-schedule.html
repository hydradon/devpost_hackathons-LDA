                    We're all high school students that have to find out what to prioritize when there is something we have to study

                <h2>
                    Students input how much time they want to spend on each subject in a chronological order. When they press submit, it will start a timer and alert the students when the alarm reaches 0 and it is time to move onto the next subject.

                    We used html, javascript, css,

                    We were proud when the timer would stop at 0, and not go into negatives.

                    We learned how to code in CSS and Javascript.

                    We still have to figure out how to make the input be in minutes.
