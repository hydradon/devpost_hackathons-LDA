                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frustration at the inconvenience that comes with looking up a character without knowing the English meaning or how to pronounce it. Wanting to expand on Google Translate's photo analyzing translation feature to include more details on a word's usage. Avoid having to use the writing feature for complex characters since they are finicky and take up time to write correctly.

                <p>
                    Using a camera (webcam or Android camera), our demo recognizes a Japanese character and shows a detailed dictionary entry to the user in real time; always readable no matter what angle you hold your device because the entries always face the viewer.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity with Vuforia to create the program, with assistance from Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to create the image assets used.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues porting our Unity project into Android, despite help from multiple sources (mentors, peers, YouTube videos, Google, etc.) We also had issues with making sure our targets could be detected well.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The importance of having a game plan before the event starts. There's always unexpected issues that pop up. Persistence is key. Keeping a positive attitude and being grateful for this experience.
