                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all busy students, we wanted to never forget something important again!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You give us all your contact and social media details and set a reminder...we do the rest
                </p>
                <p>
                    Get ready to be buried in an avalanche of notifications!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With lots of coding and little sleep
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had lots of faff with making a server and then wrestled with way too many APIs, but made it in the end!
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We built a thing that actually works!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APIs be crazy
