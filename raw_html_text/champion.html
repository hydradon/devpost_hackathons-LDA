                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Declining mental health is a widespread problem, especially among college students--it is reported that 61% of students  suffer from mild to severe mental health concerns. This often results in apathy and lethargy, and can have a detrimental effect on students' academic success and overall happiness. What many people who experience depression struggle with most is breaking the cycle and we're aiming to change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application acts as a motivational accountability buddy. It allows users to break down projects into goals, and keep up with their friends' progress. The app's community feed shares their character's "level" to compete with their friends, but keep their privacy. By encouraging interaction between users, the app provides a network of support. By incorporating characters and other RPG elements, the app makes achieving life goals more like a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, Java, and Firebase to build this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had no prior experience with Firebase and little experience in Android development. We were able to incorporate basic storage, updating, and access for user authentication and account information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking inspiration from the Facebook Messenger app for Android, we also included bubble feature that floats on the phone's screen. In the future, we'd like to make this bubble the "buddy" character that reminds the user of their goals and challenges. Since it is accessible on every screen, it is convenient and encouraging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get more experience with Android development and work with Firebase for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Champion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are excited about the future of this application. We would like to further incorporate the database and add functionality for a reward system and challenges made for friendly competition, and we'd like to flesh out the application with animations and other graphics to reinforce the game theme.
