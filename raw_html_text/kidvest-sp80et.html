                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to create a hack for social good. As believers in the power of education, we developed a game with a goal to better educate middle schoolers about money management.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kidvest is a web-based RPG that teaches the user about the basics of investing through analogies to the adventure&rsquo;s quest.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using JavaScript and HTML
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it challenging to come up with the idea of our hack and to explain fundamental financial terminology and concepts that middle school students could comprehend and enjoy.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that teamwork makes the dream work! And communication is key.

                    What's next for Kidvest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand on this concept by covering other money management topics and increasing our target audience (high schoolers). Our vision is to equip students with fundamental financial management skills through our fun platform Kidvest.
