                    Someday at work are exhausting. Your back hurts from being hunched over at the desk. If only there was something to ease the pain. Well, now their is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This vest has a heating pad and mini vibrators to sooth the back. Targeting the lower back and the shoulders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed a vest that would contain the technology on the inside, turning the mechanism on through a switch in the pocket. The arduino controls the vibrators.
