                    Inspiration: We are taking a course on data visualization where we use Tableau.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: A effective visualization has to pass the 5-second rule and the Grandma test.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: Using Tableau and Excel.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Missing data, data cleaning, and lack of context of the data
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We successfully used what we learned in our course.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: Data cleaning is essential yet difficult.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mason Waste and Energy Dashboard: We would like to create a user-interactive website using the visualization built in Tableau and made it accessible to everyone.
