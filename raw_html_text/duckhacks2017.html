                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the creation of so many ER games, and by the game of Manhunt itself, and we were inspired to create a modifiable, interactive app that would expand upon what people would be able to do, in much more complex areas.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Program is a multiplayer ER game where players play a combined version of tag, based off the game manhunt, using our app, which provides them with ways of tracking victory, as well as defining boundaries and other details.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We run a java server which stores relevant information in a MySQL database. The app is done using android studio, which is in java.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the server and app portions of our project proved to be quite difficult. We were plagued by many errors where the format that we defined for input/output was not clearly understood, or misinterpreted, and often had complex errors stemming from something as simple as a typo. It was also difficult to handle multithreaded programs, as we had to learn for the first time how to work with asynchronous threads.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all started with minimal to no knowledge of Android devlopment. Throughout the 24 hours, we learned a brand new platform, and worked well together in fixing all coding issues.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned a lot about backend SQL server development, as well as the front end portions of app development. We all had to learn a lot about these various systems as we went, and we also learned how well to

                    We will be continuing to develop and improve our app, and potentially even launch it on the app store.
