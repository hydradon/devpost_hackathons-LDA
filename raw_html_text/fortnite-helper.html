                    This project will show how a user is playing and whether they can be disturbed or if they are on a winning streak and should be left alone. In addition to that some other goals are to display daily challenges as well as past performances on top of updating data for an app to show.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created a node server to query a third party fortnite api for latest playing statistics and deployed that to a Raspberry Pi Zero wireless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the user statistics were trending downward I would then send an HTTP request to another node server running on the Rasperry Pi that would then send some data over bluetooth to an Arduino Mega, and display a helpful message to anyone in the vicinity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bluetooth communication was a lot tougher to get going that I expected. It isn't quite as well coded as I would have liked, but I plan on fixing that with my hack day partner/son over time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a working prototype at the end of the hackday which is much more than I expected to accomplish!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the right tools a lot can be accomplished in a short amount of time!

                <p>
                    Refactoring and possibly printing a case for the LED screen.
