                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was several of our group members first hackathon so we wanted to pick a challenge that would be meaningful and something we could relate to. Our current health care system is inefficient and we see a huge potential to make ease of access and patient and doctor communication stronger. With a collaborative backgrounds in biology and engineering we thought we would be the perfect fit for designing a application meet the needs of this challenge.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows for the doctors and patients to create profiles to track and monitor patient appointment and dosage levels, as well as provide the patient access to several doctors who can administer the medicine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a variety of different tools including java script, html, css, bootstrap, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As beginners we had to learn HTML and become comfortable with the front-end as well as back-end aspects of this project. We had to learn about what the intrathecal pump was and how we could improve the current process. As well, because we were beginners we under estimated how much time it would take, so we had to scale back what we expected to accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have accomplished creating and formatting a website application with no past frontend experience. We also developed skills that enabled us to save and retrieve data from a database, allowing a new user or physician to be made and saved in the database. This accomplishment means the user can input appointments and information which will be saved and accessible in any location and on any device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was several group members first hackathon we learned, all about the what a hackathon is and how they work. As well, we had never worked with Html or Css so we were able to effectively make a useable web application. We learned how the front end and back end works which helped us become successful.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Mac++ Pump Portal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application has the potential to expand exponentially with additional features such as GPS to locate hospitals and clinics, fingerprinting for log in, notifications for messages, and implementation across different hospitals in Canada as well as internationally.
