                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app has an internet database so you can log into the app from anywhere.The app has a bunch of functions to help people, such as a function that sends a distress message with the person's location to the person's emergency contacts (that they set) in case they are lost and also has the capability to create reminders.In addition to this the app also has a panic button that can both call and text to the user's emergency contacts.To help the visually impaired the app also has text to speech capabilities that announces the emergency contact's name if the button is pressed for a while.The app has the ability to search for nearby events and hire domestic services from home to make life easier.The app stores user credentials on a private web database and thus provides a degree of security and privacy when compared to the MIT App Inventor's default web database while enhancing storage capabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was created by the MIT App Inventor platform, and the whole app was divided into sub-parts, with each team member working on a different part. When all of us were done with the components, we merged our respective projects and fine-tuned the details of the final app. We tested the app multiple times on different phones to ensure that the data was actually being stored in the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To ensure that the data from the logins was stored over a period of time, we had to create our own web-database, which was quite a challenge. Merging all the components in the end turned out to be tricky as merging is not an inbuilt function in app-inventor.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While the app in itself may not lead us to victory, we definitely learnt a lot with this experience. We'll leave NTU with memories of a great experience and a lot of knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we learnt in the end was teamwork with a realization that being too ambitious ALWAYS turns out to be a bad idea. It was a great experience being in such an environment and we made great memories in the end of it.
