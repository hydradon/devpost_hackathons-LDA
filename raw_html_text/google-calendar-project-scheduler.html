                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted something like this, so I decided to make it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app helps you find time to work on projects, assuming you use Google Calendar. It looks through your calendar and slots in new events based on a few input parameters.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Android Studio.

                <p>
                    Google Calendar API is real funky.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about using google API's and modern Android permission use.

                <p>
                    A whole bunch of features, like sharing the events with collaborators, optimizations in finding time for you, ability to ignore weekends, and more!
