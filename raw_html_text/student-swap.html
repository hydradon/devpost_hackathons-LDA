                    As students we face the daily struggle to find items we need for school at a low price, good condition and a considerably close distance away. So we decided to create a solution for this problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created a website that is aimed to help students like us and make it convenient to find textbooks and other material needed online.This website would connect two people that need an item with a person that is offering the item for sale. We really encourage trading textbooks so it is less wasteful to the environment and try to minimize our carbon footprint in the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a lot of hard work and brainstorming on design and function we started by creating a front page using html and we divided the workload to each person's level of skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Certain parts of the website were fairly difficult to arrange in the beginning, but became easier as the hackathon progressed. For example, a picture would be above/below the text when we wanted the picture to be on the side of a body of text. In addition, we had several difficulties in manipulating data(tags) and learning new programming languages such as JavaScript and a type of Html(Bootstrap).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're proud to say that we all have learnt HTML to a certain extent and we overcame the difficult challenge of manipulating tags by fixing some minor details and correctly interpreting steps found on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learnt to program in different languages and we also learnt the power and capabilities of a hackathon. We didn't realise that it was possible to create a website within a time of 24 hours even when most of us didn't know how to create a web page. It's amazing what students can achieve when given the opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Student Swap will not end here. Later on in the future we will improve the website by continuously optimizing it to needs of the future. For example, we would try to publish e-books and/or new items that become popular in universities and an item a student in the future would need.
