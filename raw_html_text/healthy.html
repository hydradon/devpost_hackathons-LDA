                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build an app that allows people to wake up and be healthy. we wanted to give everyone that little push they needed to remind them to exercise every day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an alarm that requires exercise to dismiss the alarm. It implements the a5SDK to allow the user to input their workouts through the activ5 device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split the work by allowing one to focus on developing the activ5 portion, while the other built the alarm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the activ5 code as it was all written in an unfamiliar language (Kotlin). Learning all the necessities to build an alarm from the ground up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the app and having successful test runs. Smooth integration of the alarm into the activ5 software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to create an app from the ground up in less than two days. It was an intense experience that led to the beautiful fruition that we would like to call Healthy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Healthy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To create more ringtone options, allow the user to choose the volume. Implement a more visual game experience with the activ5. Create a lock screen that links to the activ5 software.
                </p>
