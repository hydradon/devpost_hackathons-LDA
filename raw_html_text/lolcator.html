                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love to use League of Legends to start friendships with other players on campus. But sometimes it's still hard to find those players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website gathers locations of fellow League players and places them on a collective map. Other players can come to the site and see players who have previously added their self.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a website. We used HTML, PHP, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EVERYTHING. LITERALLY EVERYTHING GAVE US ISSUES. But we triumphed in the end.  Ajax was scary at first, but we used it like the pros. It was difficult learning how Google Maps works. It was also our first time using Riot API. We also never used Amazon Web Services before for databases, but it's SUPER useful and powerful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a working prototype in the end. We can actually add users and view others!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how fun it is to use GitHub. 
Honestly, we learned almost everything today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LoLcator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we are not successful in this hackathon, we still plan on continuing development of the site as it is something we could use ourselves. Additional features include a login system, communication system, better organization of BIG DATA, and more integration with Riot's API.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    If the lolcator.comlu.com site does not appear to work at first, refresh the page! Riot's API is a bit restrictive.
