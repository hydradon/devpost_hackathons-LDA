                <p>
                    When talking to collegiate athletes they expressed interest in a better way to analyze and present already widely available medical device data (Apple watch for example).

                <p>
                    Takes data from athletes such as heart rate and oxygen consumption during a workout to provide them with real-time feedback on how intense their workout is as well as trends on their habits and exercise. The athletes personalized data can then be taken to a professional such as a personal trainer who can then use their logs to provide a quicker and more accurate assessment of what's going on.
