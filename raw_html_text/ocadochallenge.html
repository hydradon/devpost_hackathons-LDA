                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the Ocado challenge to find an algorithm to pack their totes based on a large customer order, to allow maximum efficiency. Using these rules, we took it a step further by creating an application to do this for us, and output it in a Table and in a csv document
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a csv file and will pack it in totes according to the Ocado Guidelines
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Java8
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to implement all the rules that were in the guidelines proved to be detrimental, since the algorithm is a NP(Hard) problem, and has a massive running time, causing our program to crash. We decided then to compromise by implementing as many rules as possible, while still keeping the program simple
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel we have developed a user friendly and efficient algorithm, that will make packing totes much simpler!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that algorithms that seem simple on paper may not be effective in a machine, and that tote packing is much harder than it looks!
                </p>

                    What's next for OcadoChallenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To improve the algorithm and to improve the user experience to alter size of the totes, products available and output options
