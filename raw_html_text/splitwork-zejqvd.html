                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As fresh grad students living with our batch mates and doing all the household chores on out own, we faced difficulties in dividing the household work fairly and systematically.Many a times we do not have the time to any activity and some other times we are not aware of what to do.The household chores greatly vary in their strenuous levels; where some are easy like vacuum cleaning, others are difficult like dish cleaning and most other flatmates are unaware of what other person has done.
All these problems prompted us to build the "SplitWork"

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It performs 3 activities : a) Anybody in a group can can create any task, each member in the group will be able to see those tasks b)Through voting by each member of the group, the strenuous level of the task is decided  c). For each group the Pie-chart is made to show the relative contribution of each member in the group.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided the work into Front-end and Back-end.Where Abhiram handled the Android part , I handled the back-end part.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us were new to the technologies when we started, therefore we had to learn and implement at the same time.At one point we were stuck in the Android and we could not resolve it.However, we changed our implementation a little bit and went ahead.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We never knew we could work so hard without sleeping for two days continuously.We had completed 100% of our back-end and 80% of android.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Apart from the obvious technical aspects, the fun of going into Hack Mode.

                    What's next for SplitWork
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We might think of building it to full and giving it to students , as we believe it can greatly help them.
