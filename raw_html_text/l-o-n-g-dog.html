                <p>
                    We created an intuitive app for people with visual impairment to help them better understand their surroundings.
                </p>

                        <p>
                            Describing the Scene: Using our app, users can get a description of the scene in front of them. The app provides a natural human-like caption instead of simply listing out the items detected in the scene. For example, when we tested this by taking a noisy picture at the hackathon, the app returned "a person sitting at a table with his laptop", which is in fact the most important part of the scene.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Directional Audio: We also offer directional audio to list the objects in the scene based on their location, which allows users to understand their surrounding quickly through an innovative approach.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Describing Faces: The app can describe the faces and help decipher the emotions of individuals the camera is pointed to.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Visual Question Answering: The app can also answer questions the user poses about the scene. Some examples of questions are "what is the shirt color of the person in the picture?" and "what is the can of soda in front of me?".
                        </p>

                            Color contrast filters: help friends and family simulate having color blindness, as well as help individuals with color blindness navigate their surroundings

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We attempt an innovative API free of explicit "modes", making it more intuitive and quicker to use than apps with scrolling modes (e.g. Apple's camera).
