                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The IBM challenge! When disasters occur, there's a huge need for resources such as food, water, clothing, and more. While there are NGOs and charities that may set up stations to deliver these resources, it takes time to put together these relief efforts. Our project aims to connect nearby citizens with victims of disasters to provide them with necessary resources as soon as possible.

                    Users can enter in a request or offer for resources by typing in the type of resource, quantity, and where they're located. Other can then view these requests and offers.

                <p>
                    We'd like to add location services to make it easier for users to quickly find requests and offers near them, and implement more user-friendly interactions to make the website run more smoothly.
