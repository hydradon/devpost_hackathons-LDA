                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of my friends work in NYC. A big thing among millennials there is going to food trucks instead of restaurants over lunch breaks. Generally these trucks serve gourmet food and are much faster than restaurants. Furthermore, in Nashville, food trucks are a growing industry and we'd like to make it easier to find and use them. - Kunal

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reads in all tweets by food trucks in the Nashville Food Truck Association. Then find the most recent locations of each food truck and display it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program uses PHP, Javascript, HTML and CSS. All of these interface with Twitter's API and Google Maps API. The app reads in the tweets, then finds strings in the tweet that are locations (many food truck tweets have locations in Nashville), and tests them against Google Maps Places API and Geocoding API to see if a viable location can be found for a tweet. The app uses keywords in the tweets to parse for the locations and addresses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many, many, many challenges. The API interfacing was by far the biggest challenge. We knew pretty much exactly how we wanted to parse the tweets, but the limitations of Twitter and Google Maps API's were very challenging. We spent a lot of time learning how to use each and how to optimize the program to run well online.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The speed at which we developed the app and how we were quickly able to integrate the Maps and Twitter API. There were so many challenges we faced but we worked as a team to fix and improve every part of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about the different API's that we used. And how to appropriately structure a project in order to get it done in a timely fashion.

                    What's next for FoodTrax
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding functionality to organize food trucks based on cuisine and other criteria that a user would find significant. We would also like to scale the site to a wider level.
