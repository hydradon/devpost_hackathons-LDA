                    This was a pretty difficult project for us, as it was our first time creating a full-stack web-app. None of us really had any experience in this kind of project, and as a result, we ran into a number of pitfalls during implementation that halted or slowed progress by a significant amount.

                    The initial goal was to create a full frontend in React, a robust backend in Python and Flask, and use a PostgreSQL database to store the necessary data. The end product is mostly haphazardly hacked together and we definitely didn't utilize most of these tools to their full potential. However, it definitely taught us a lot about combining these kinds of frameworks in the future and the importance of integrating them well early in development. As it is, the app is in a proof-of concept state and is not fully ready for use.

                    We really liked our idea of helping the elderly and disabled with public transportation, but we feel that our application doesn't necessarily live up to the expectations we had for it going in. If we had further time to develop and refine the application, we would implement a host of other functionality, including built-in trip planning, bus support, more flexible user account creation and modification, and possibly expansion to other transit systems than Chicago.
