                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our entire group loves hiking, camping, and road trips. We combined all three into an application that makes it easy to plan road trips that highlight great campsites and hiking locations!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Receives two cities as input and outputs a road trip, so you can get going!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We pulled geocode data from a number of APIs, then used that data to come up with a route overview for the trip.  From there, we queried several travel APIs to get data on hiking and camping at each stop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Django was real hard, so then we switched flask to front end, and then receiving user input through that still proved too difficult. It was all of our first time developing a full stack, and even using python so the learning curve was steep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google autocomplete API was successfully implemented and looked real sweet, and deploying the site using google cloud services was a moment of victory when other machines were able to access the site. Only had done minimal local hosting before, so actual deployment was so cool!
We all used APIs for the first time and it was really fun receiving all of the dynamic content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask, django, using APIs, deployment, and a lot of python.
                </p>

                    What's next for GetGoing!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finish up the project, and get that front end site working.
