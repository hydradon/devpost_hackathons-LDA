                    How we built it

                    Built with javafx to display the graph, used twitter4j library to read data from the twitter api, and then used google cloud language processor to gather sentiment.

                    Originally used a library for the NLP written by Stanford but it ended up giving poor sentiment values so had to switch last minute to google language processor
