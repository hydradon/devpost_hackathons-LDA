                    Our inspiration was to create a way for students to relieve the daily stressors of being a college student. Our game, Calming with  Hands, incorporates levels to get rid of their stresses a real world fashion. 
In the beginning the user is introduced to the setting, calming hands. Level 1 is where the user can rip up their essays and dreaded assignments. Level 2 is where the user can throw their annoying laptops against the brick wall. Level 3 is where the user can bat their textbooks out of the park.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built it using the scratch functions, incorporation if statements, while loops, and coordinating with the leap motion. 
Challenges we went into was calibrating the leap motion movements to allow actions in scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the smooth transitions and levels. 
We learned about scratch mechanics and more about the leap motion software.

                    What next for calming hands is more levels!
