                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always wanted to create games that use some cool geometry.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A game where you have to place an object so that the sum of the distances from other objects is the smallest possible
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Love 2D framework
                </p>

                <p>
                    Creating a game entirely of my own in one day in a framework I got to know on the day of the hackathon.
