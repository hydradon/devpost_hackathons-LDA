                    "Complicated" is a word many people use to describe politics. In a world filled with biased sources and a plethora of information, it's hard to find good information on your local representatives. We aim to make the researching process easier for voters by matching them with their local political candidates based on their views. Users take a short quiz and are matched with local politicians. They are also given the opportunity to learn more about their top choice directly through our website. We hope that in taking this quiz, the user would gain awareness to both his or her viewpoints and to their representatives, encouraging active civic engagement without intimidating entry barriers.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    In building this hack, we used the Wix Code editor, implementing our project with algorithms and databases we created to find the perfect match.

                    We're all just beginners, but it was fun to play around and add our own customized features to the website!
