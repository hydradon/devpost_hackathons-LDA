                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I decided that the online harassment project would be the center of my work and thought I would try to learn something new that I've never touched, javascript. One of my favorite chrome extensions is very similar to this and it is the cloud-to-butt extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A predefined set of words, chosen from a list of the most popular curse words, is searched for in a website using a walker in javascript and replaced with other words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I referenced plenty of programs that essentially replace words on webpages with other words and tried to edit it to fit my needs of censoring webpages. I first learned to make a very basic chrome extension and then tried to work off the public github source files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I could not understand how to break down a webpage's elements into nodes that are readable. Once I was able to implement existing work to run a walker to read all the words in a webpage once it's done running it finally worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to read and understand other people's work from github and manipulate it to do what I wanted it to and understand the formatting for the regex that is used for the searched words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basics and some intricacies of javascript and how to start my own project from scratch in javascript.
                </p>

                    What's next for SalemCensor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly extend the library of words to search for to extend to all the popular words and variants of spelling.
