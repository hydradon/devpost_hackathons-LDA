                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People these days work in open offices, to foster collaboration. But one of the most common problems is finding people or spaces to collaborate
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Office assistant knows where different people are &amp; will tell you how to find them. If you want to find say Bob, it would tell you where it last saw Bob or tell who it saw Bob with. If someone needs to book a focus room you could ask Office assistant to do that
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    '''
It presumes that images from different parts of office security cameras are getting uploaded in a s3 bucket organized by location, date &amp; time
A backend lambda parses different images &amp; captures - people who are in the images, objects etc &amp; stores it as time series data in DynamoDB
When a request is made to office assistant to find someone it looks the DB
To book a room Office Assistant integrates with Robin Calendar API
                </p>
