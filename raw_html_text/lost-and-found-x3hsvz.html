                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jason and I always tend to lose items and we thought it would be helpful to have an app where other people can tell you if they find your lost object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows for people to post a request if they lose an item and have other people reply if they find your item.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Swift and GitHub and several open-source API's
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the greatest challenge we ran into was working with GitHub since this is both our first hackathon and we don't have much experience with software like that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of finishing our project and making sure it worked. We are also proud that we pushed through the hard times that GitHub supplied us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well the greatest skill we learned by the end of this, was the basics of GitHub, how to work with API's, and how to use databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lost and Found
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely want to improve out User Interface and make edits so the application is more user friendly.
