                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested in way animals can obtain information about their environment using sound, and wanted to try to mimic that as cheaply as possible with our laptops by using the integrated hardware.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It opens a visualization (built in pygame) that shows a dot indicating which angle the loudest sound came from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used pygame to build the visualization, pyaudio for fetching the webcam audio, and numpy and scipy for maff

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the stereo webcam microphones on our laptops are only about 8cm apart, which with a 44100

                <p>
                    also, it turns out that the differences in webcam microphone quality is pretty significant. Even though pete's were way older, jesse's were less sensitive to sound and harder to use because of that.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked out something that initially seemed conceptually difficult, and learned new math and a new library along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Fourier analysis (though we ended up not needing it), which neither of us knew anything about before the Hackathon. We also learned about audio processing, which we didn't have any experience with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ( ͡&deg; ͜ʖ ͡&deg;)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd love to be able to pick out a specific sound to locate, but this is really hard. We have some ideas about using specific supersonic tones, but those probably wouldn't work out within the time limits of the hackathon and without specifically chosen speakers
                </p>
                <p>
                    it would also be cool to get a third microphone up in the mix so we could potentially add an extra dimension to our output ( ͡☉ ͜ʖ ͡☉)
                </p>
                <p>
                    maybe doing this with a raspberry pi to make it more portable or something? idk

                    to try it on your own laptop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Remember that you need stereo webcam microphones, which it seems like macs don't have, as well as some other computers
                </p>
                <p>
                    also, you're gonna have to have
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        pyaudio
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        pygame
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        numpy
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        scipy
installed in whatever python environment you're using. &iquest;how do packaging software?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    then you can give it the old run-a-roo with
                    <code>
                        python visualize.py
                    </code>
