                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Student attendance is required for many classes and instructors often have to spend around 5 minutes to check that everybody is there.  Why not shorten that time by just taking a photo and uploading it to a website?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The client can upload a jpg of the classroom as well as a zip folder of jpgs containing individual photos for each student.  After uploading these files, the website will output the list of students who are there as well as how many students are in class for the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started making the backbone for unzipping files in python and counting/interacting with the microsoft faces api in Java. We also used php to organize some files and started writing some javascript for event driven programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled through looking at all of the Face API, because documentation was lacking for some parts and we were not using the standard C# code that was provided for a lot of the examples.  We were using Java and had to go through the git repo to figure out what the appropriate method calls were.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of getting the Face API working for the most part.  We were able to adapt to our circumstances and bounce back after realizing we were going down the wrong path.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot on how APIs work and how to request them.
                </p>
