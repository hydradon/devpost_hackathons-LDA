                    The motivation for Trash2Treasure is a prevalent problem among retail businesses, excess inventory. Brian's family owned laundromat hoards copious amounts of clothing leftover everyday. It sucks. Not only laundromats, but also bookstores and restaurants have leftover food and merchandise that go to waste. Oddly enough, there are organizations and businesses that collect excess inventory, but there is a disconnect between hoarders and collectors.

                    To solve this problem, Trash2Treasure will acquaint desperate business to get rid of their "Trash" and organizations/business that "Treasure" that trash. Donators, businesses with excess inventory, can quickly search for collectors through our web app simply by taking a picture and briefly describing their trash vocally and vice versa.

                    In the future, we would like to implement geolocation services on real data so that businesses may describe their waste with speech and take a picture, with our app recording their location to place them on a map, for collectors to see.  The minimizes the amount of time businesses spend on their waste, the penultimate objective.
