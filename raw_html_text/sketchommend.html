                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How cool would it be if with a few strokes a novice user could create artistic creations. How cool would it be if we had a system which could autocomplete our sketches just as google autocompletes our search queries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide an interactive sketch recommendation system to autocomplete user's sketches  and photorealistically render them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a paper in the International Conference in Computer Vision about interactive sketch recommendation system using AI. We hacked on top of that to add artistic capabilities coupled with the interactive recommendation abilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We also wanted a new version of interactive Photoshop poweredd by AI whereby given any image it would allow us to interactively edit the image with the recommendation system. To enable that we take any image, obtain the corresponding sketches and backproject into the AI to enable such capabilities. But we were unsuccessful in making such an interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AI should not be a blackbox and interact with the humans to enhance human capabilities. Our tool with an interactive system was really amazing to play around with. The artistic effects that were created were better than I hoped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about interactive computer graphics powered by AI and how human capabilities can be greatly enhanced with current technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sketchommend
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be a great boon to the animators who spend a lot of time keyframing sketches which can be very time consuming. We are thinking of making a polished product for the Hollywood industry so that we see more magic along the lines of Pixar's Toy Story!
