                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a high school senior struggling with many AP classes, I have come to realize the importance of prioritizing my studies at home. If I am struggling with calculus, for example, I need to devote more time into studying calculus but at the same time, I need to devote a little bit of time for other subjects as well because I can't let those classes suffer either. For this reason, devoting time to each class so that it may maximize the overall grade is very important. And this is why I thought it'd be great if there was a mobile app or a website that would keep track of how much time I spent studying each subject. Using this information, I would be able to figure out if the amount of time I spent on each subject is the good amount.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As stated before, my program keeps track of how much time the user spent on each subject. After timing him/herself, there is a spot where the user can enter the subject he/she studied. If the user decides to study a different subject, they can time themselves again and add the new subject. The user will be able to see the time from previous subjects even after they have completed many subjects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build my program. At the top of the page, the description of what the program will do was displayed using HTML. At the bottom, I placed a digital clock, also using HTML. The timer starts when the user presses the START button and stops when the user presses the STOP button. The slot in which the user can enter the name of the subject is hidden when the clock is running and appears after the user has pressed the STOP button. The clock is hidden just as the subject slot appears. Next to the name of the subject, the time appears also. JavaScript was used to do that. When the START button is clicked, the program itself starts timing itself. When the STOP button is clicked, the program stops timing. The time interval between the two is then printed out next to the subject slot. The timer doesn't do anything other than keeping time for the user's accessibility. After printing out the name of the subject and the time, the program repeats until the user decides to exit out of the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, I tried to use a JavaScript version of the time, which was not successful. I tried to figure out a way to solve this problem but decided to change the timer instead. Resorting to HTML timer still had the same problem so instead of trying to pass time directly from the timer, I decided to let the program keep a time of its own and print that out instead. Also, I couldn't figure out a way to insert time for each of the subjects. This problem was also solved by letting the program keep its own time.

                <p>
                    I am very proud of completing my very first major program and my very first Hackathon.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that if I stick to the problem and try to fix it, I will eventually find a solution. 
In addition, I learned how to create a basic webpage using HTML and JavaScript.

                <p>
                    In the future, Study Tracker Pro will keep a record of all the times the user studied even after the program is closed. Also, a pie graph of all the subjects in proportion to the time will be created for easy analysis.
