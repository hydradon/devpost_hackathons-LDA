                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by complaints of residents in bustling cities around the world in getting a sufficient parking space, Parkbnb provides a breakthrough solution in providing additional parking space through lease-and-rent system with any of its community members. Aside from getting easier parking access, leasers will get extra money through leasing parking space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can find and rent a parking spot from home-owners who have avaialble parking space, either by booking/schedule appointment or directly on-the-spot through QR code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built through Android Studio in Java and incorporated with vast user database. We also provide additional interface and website development with HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very short time, have never used Java or Android Studio before (no experience), long time for debugging and integrating between app and database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developed the system that is equipped with the following features:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Main, specific, and confirmation pages that flows with smooth enough interface
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        QR scanner, code generator, and success response.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integration of bookings and databases between users (leasers and leasees) as well as payment systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Arduino proximity sensors as additional security measures(to signal if someone trespass property).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
