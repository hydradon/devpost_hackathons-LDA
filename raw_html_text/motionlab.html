                    Our Vision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the recent rise in Virtual Reality and Gesture Sensors we saw our opportunity to create something that can affect students around the globe. Bringing affordable VR education tools to classrooms. Inspired from using clay to model objects. With technologies like the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion available in the market we thought up an idea which has been recently gaining traction: online collaboration. We hope that in the future people can use our product and learn something new, if that happens then we have accomplished our mission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MotionLab is a software which allows users to interact with 3D models. Our website currently lets users upload 3D models which other users can download for educational purposes. These 3D models also come with tags that the user can place on the model, this can help students learn about the structure of objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently allows the user to interact with a 3D model and add tags to the model and share it on the web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Oculus rift and Leap motion to interact with the 3D models inside of Unity. Our application uses gestures and physics so that the user can interact with objects. For example, poking the object will allow the user to place a tag on a certain part of the object.Website was built with PHP, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Amazon Web Services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we encountered
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collision detection in Unity was limiting so we had to make custom collision models.
VR is hard to control because of the lack of precision from leap motion, tagging is not optimized because it has issues in the VR environment but works in 2D. Time was limited because our project is very broad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually got it to work in such a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with Leap Motion and Oculus for the hardware, and learned how to use Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our plans for the future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to provide an affordable way for students to improve the way they learn. Our product can also help experts in the field with their research or work. Finally we are also hoping to make our application accessible via the internet which means people will be able to collaborate with friends and colleagues online.

                    I have always been into DIY projects since it's so satisfying to realize you created something after you pour your heart and soul in something you love doing. I was inspired by one of my friends during high school when he got over fifty thousand downloads from Google Play Store with one of his apps. My dream is to have my own tech company in order to bring innovations to the world.

                    I am a 21 year old programmer who has been programming for approximately 4 years now. Within these 4 years I worked on my most proud achievement which has yet to be released. It's an app that I have been working on with my friends for the past 2 years. My short term goals include passing all my University courses and getting a Masters degree in Software Engineering. Finally I will leave you with one of my favorite quotes "Jack of all trades, master of none, though oftentimes better than the master of one".

                    I am a 20 programmer that was born in Montreal. I first encountered programming while studying Computer Science in CEGEP. The endless possibilities that were available in this field greatly arose my interest in it. My greatest achievement to this day is graduating from John Abbott College in Computer Science. I am currently studying Software Engineering at Concordia University and I am looking forward to discover more about this field.
