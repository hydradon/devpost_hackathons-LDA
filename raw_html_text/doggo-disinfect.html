                    The goal was to build something fun and useful and learn about APIs along the way. We decided upon a Google Chrome extension that uses Clarifai's image classification API to tag images and then filter them based on whether or not the images met certain user-specified conditions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges and Future Directions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we were able to build a minimum viable product, we ran into a key issue: on pages with many images, the number of API calls causes the load time to be extremely high, making it impractical. This may require reworking our entire model.
