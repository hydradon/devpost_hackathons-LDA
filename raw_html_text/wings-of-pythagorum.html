                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Andy's daughter Ruby is in 4th grade and we saw her getting bored with the educational math games assigned by her school.  I knew something was wrong because she loves video games, but the quality of most educational video games these days is way below industry standard.  We decided to create an educational game to help kids practice their basic math, that was way more modern, cool and interesting than a lot of the 2d educational games we see out there right now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to play as Amelia Gearheart and explore expansive levels of floating steam ships, defeat steam bots and solve puzzles using increasingly challenging math skills.  It works on Android, iOS, Windows and Mac computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Andrew modeled all the characters in blender and did all the artwork himself using photoshop.  We used Unity 3d to build the game and tested with Ruby's classmates to find and fix bugs and make the game more fun and challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plenty of learning experiences with bringing objects from blender into Unity, game play balance issues - giving them too much flying ability caused the kids to bypass many puzzles and learning opportunities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our final round of testing with the kids they had 45 minutes to playtest the game, and none of them wanted to stop playing after 45 minutes.  They were cooperating on the math questions so it was a source of pride to hear them urgently shouting out math questions to solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about 3d modeling and animation and unity development, also that we need to have kids playtest the game as their experience is a lot different than ours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wings of Pythagorum
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we are planning to implement some form of monetization - possibly advertisements between levels or try to find sponsorship, and then release it to the masses on iOS, Android, Windows and MacOS.
