                    Choosing professors is difficult, especially among the equally great. Input the name of a memorable professor and match him/her with the professor most similar in personality.
                </p>

                    How It Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our data model uses text classification on Polyratings reviews. It produces similarity scores between professors from the adjectives that students use to describe them.

                    Challenges We Faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first used GCP's Sentiment Analysis but found that it had trouble managing the size of our dataset. It also didn't provide a suitable metric for professor comparability. Instead, we aggregated the counts of most common adjectives and used a weighted model to estimate differences in personality.
