                </p>
                <p>
                    We used to treat factories and manufacturing as a process as a simple straightforward process.Traditionally they were monitored using a set of simple metrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Advances in technology and artificial intelligence helped us to do the next step - start building a Sentient Factory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this concept a factory no longer will be represented by a set of simple numbers.
Instead it will possess a basic sentience to make the most optimal decisions based on its goals and will assist humans in the most proactive way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to implement this concept we need to integrate with a lot of industrial, financial and operational data sources. Predix is a good fit for that and using Stelia manufacturing data we can showcase the capabilities of this new technology.
