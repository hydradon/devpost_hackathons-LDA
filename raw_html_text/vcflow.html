                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    vcFlow is inspired by programmers needing to better understand the runtime behavior of new codebases that they deal with. From a mechanistic view, vcFlow is inspired by in-situ visualization and event-sequence visualization paradigms in the data visualization field.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    vcFlow annotates code to show which parts are running at runtime. It also visualizes variable values through time. A programmer can interact with their program and observe which parts of their codebase are running and how correct/wrong the variables look.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built vcFlow with a client-server architecture and by utilizing Python's system trace capabilities. The server-side runs in the background and sends runtime information to an editor (Atom) for visualization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because vcFlow essentially runs as a remote code-tracer, debugging vcFlow itself was somewhat difficult. I decoupled different parts of the code and tested them separately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deploying vcFlow as an installable Atom plugin and the simplistic architecture are the two main things I like about this work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned working with Python's runtime objects such as frames. That was fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for vcFlow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to add a more featureful syntax for describing what visualizations the user can have for a variable. I would also like to experiment with adding support for a language other than Python.
                </p>
