                    Plagiarism Detector

                <p>
                    This project - currently a Proof of Concept - is a plagiarism detector that utilises Machine Learning, and it was made for BigRedHacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, plagiarism detectors rely on direct quotation to catch someone,
                    <strong>
                        but plagiarism
                        <em>
                            is not
                        </em>
                        bound to just quoting without citation!
                    </strong>
                    One of the most common, but hardly combatted, areas of Plagiarism is paying for someone else to write a paper for you. The reason why it's rarely combatted is the difficulty in proving it.
                    <em>
                        That does not mean, however, that the teacher is unaware
                    </em>
                    . More often than not, a teacher can tell when a paper has been forged due to the change - even if subtle - of writing style. This was the inspiration for this project. This project aims to act as a tool for teachers to prove that someone has used a forged paper by creating a literary footprint of the student and applying machine learning to determine the similarity (or lackthereof) in the writing style of a new paper.

                    Areas for improvement:
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Currently, although functioning, some false-positives are produced, which is obviously unacceptable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The application currently is a desktop application - written in python and C#, a WPF application. Although functioning, I'd like to move the python to a server and have a web-interface for the teachers - removing any need to install python modules, etcetera.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I'd like to implement a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) so that essays written longer ago are valued less than more recent ones.
