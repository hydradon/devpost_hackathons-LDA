                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Selecting outfits has always been difficult due to the vast array of items I could choose from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to make an account, then add clothing items connected to their account. We wanted it to then make clothing outfit suggestions, but we ran out of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using android-studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a problem trying to read data from Firebase and then displaying the data. We spent 12+ hours trying to solve this problem, but were ultimately unable to resolve the issue. It caused our app to crash, so we could not move forward, which was extremely disappointing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud that we were able to set up an authentication/login screen as well as a signup screen. Going into this hackathon with limited android-studio experience, we were astounded by what we were able to accomplish in terms of the functional screens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Clothes Jam
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely want to keep working on this app and at some point release it to the public. It is truly a passion for us and we would love to be able to see it as a working product.
