                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing nations accounted for 99% of maternal deaths. India alone accounted for 19% of maternal deaths. These statistics were jarring, and according to the 3 Delays Model, this results from the idea that under-served patients delay in seeking care, reaching care, and receiving adequate and appropriate care. While these first two issues are being addressed via the Millenium Development Goals, the last part is where our product comes in.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RAOT addresses the lack of healthcare personnel and inefficient c-section postpartum care. Also, it collects data to determine c-section related mortality trends in underdeveloped countries. The RAOTband, a simplified version of a smart watch, collects vitals. This information is transmitted to the cloud. The app receives real-time data from the cloud, which is able to interact with the patient reported health data the physicians can input. Our risk stratification algorithm organizes patients by priority for clinical guidance in priority management.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a hardware prototype for the temperature sensor that would be used in our RAOTband to collect vitals. Next, we created an algorithm that the app would be able to use to take the information it receives from the cloud to create a risk score. Lastly, we created a simulation of the app interface to show how the clinician would be able to interact with the application.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team, although quite proficient in the clinical and health sciences, encountered challenges in technical proficiency. Our biggest challenges were in developing the app and algorithm.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite our challenges in technical proficiency, we were able to enlist the help of online learning software and our mentors to learn basic programming languages (Python) and website development (HTML) during the span of MedHacks. That is something we are especially proud of since we, as a team, identified our inherent strengths and enlisted each others' help to bring our idea to life.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the technical aspect of project development is incredibly important in healthcare since patient information is highly confidential. There are many cultural and social implications to our development ideas, and we must be very careful to take these into consideration while developing our app.

                    What's next for R.A.O.T. - Risk Assessment Organizing Tool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we would like to apply population health data collected from this device to create preventative measures to improve individuals' postpartum cardiovascular health. Also, we would like to use RAOT to improve individual health outcomes using these population health trends by applying predictive qualities of our software.
