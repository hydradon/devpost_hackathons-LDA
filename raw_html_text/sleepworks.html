                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you set your alarms at night you're probably only concerned about getting as much sleep as possible,&nbsp;not about what unforeseen problems in the morning could make you late for work. Even if you do account for unlikely events, a traffic situation on the day could mean the difference between a successful career and failure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app automatically works out when your day starts and how long it will take you to get to where you need to be, directly grabbed from your calendar. We factor in any current and predicted delays that may impact your trip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll even work out when you need to sleep to make sure you're more than well-rested for the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We integrated Google's Maps and Calendar API's to a vue.js-powered progressive web-app with a node.js backend. Essentially, we would grab the user's first calendar event from their Google Calendar, and post it to Google Maps as the destination source, using the user's home location as the origin, and from the returned path we would grab the travel time. From that travel time, we would also factor in the user's time needed to get ready, and then determine the time they should wake and sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sleep &amp; time! With only 24 continuous hours to work on this project, we definitely needed this app to manage our time and sleep schedule. We only managed a dozen hours of
                    <strong>
                        combined
                    </strong>
                    sleep, which would've been much more if we had this app to calculate an efficient sleep schedule.
