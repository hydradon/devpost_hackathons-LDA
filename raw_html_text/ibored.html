                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As high school students attempting to avoid homework and studying with the power of procrastination, we would often find ourselves bored and tired of watching tv or scrolling through social media posts. We wanted to create something that would give more people ideas to get active or find activities that spark creativity and imagination.

                <p>
                    When you are unsure about what you can do or what would be a fun activity for the moment, iBored can help you discover new activities to do based on your interests

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By writing up the code on sublime text, we saved all of our files into one folder and utilized html, css, and js pages to create our final product.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we were both new to programming websites, this project posed to be a big challenge. We weren't even sure where to begin, but with determination and support, we were able to code a function iBored website.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create this website at all without prior experience. Also, we were very glad to be able to learn so much in such a short amount of time.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of web development and how to implement css and javascript into an html website. Also, with the help of mentors and friends we learned how to continually improve and develop our website to make it the best we could.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more time and experience, we hope to make the iBored website into an app as well so that people can use it on the go without needing their computer. Also, we would want to create more features such as randomization, login, saved activities.
