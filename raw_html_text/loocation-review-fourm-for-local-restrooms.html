                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our friend notified us of a Purdue Instagram account which post pictures of good restrooms on campus. We thought that it would be a great idea to create an app that does something like that but on a large scale. The only way for locating bathrooms to be feasible on this scale would be to have it be crowd sourced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application locates nearby restrooms uploaded by users, and allows you to view / posts comments about it. This is useful in determining if you should use this bathroom, or look for another one nearby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android studio to build the application, Google Firebase and Cloud to handle the data, and Googles geolocation API to locate the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge we ran into was with trying to get the Google Cloud and Firebase services to communicate and send data to and from our Android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we actually finished and submitted our hack! We are also proud of our implementation of the user commenting section, so users can list specifics about certain Bathrooms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Android studio, mainly with their material design features. We also learned how to implement components from Google Firebase into Android. We also looked into implementing features from Google Cloud into our Android Project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LooCation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of features that can be implemented if we had the time, such as a like/dislike rating system, a moderation system, or an interactive map of buildings. In addition, the possibilities of adding pictures.
