                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For Muslims wanting to know the prayer times - I usually look at an app on my phone. As an Echo skill this will be a lot easier to know when the next prayer is, without having to look for my phone!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This tells you the prayer times for any city in the world. Using Google API's it fetches you're coordinates based on the city you specify. It uses your location along with an algorithm to calculates prayer times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is useful, as muslims would often want to know, if it's time to pray, or how long they have remaining for their prayers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using C#/.Net on Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, creating an Alexa skill using C# rather than java, node etc...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doing that little bit extra. For example, saving the users location so they don't need to repeat it in every request
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using serverless computing on Azure, and just generally creating an Alexa skill
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pray Pal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make it more configurable, different users may want the timing tweaked based on the calculation method they normally use
                </p>
