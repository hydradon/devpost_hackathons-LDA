                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a developer circle member (and lead) figuring out how to maintain and grow meaningful engagement is my call of duty :) I get to interact with many members, learning what informs the level of engagement they maintain on the group. As a developer community, one common determinant is how people perceive the community's disposition to help when they share a bug or challenge they are working on. When this help takes forever (or doesn't come) the fellow's spirit is dampened and for new members, this could result in losing them entirely especially if there are other engagements going on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this feeling is very understandable, the cause also is. Most times, people that get to view this post either don't have the requisite expertise to help or forget to common around to it. And for fairly large/active communities posts with lesser engagement get buried amongst others. Hence those who actually care don't get to see these call for help. More so, when folks go the extra mile of sending a direct message to those they feel can help; they receive an almost instant response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had earlier tried to solve for this by polling member for their skillsets and interest. And with this, we actively tagged members on posts we deem matching to the indicated skillset and interest. This worked amazingly, increasing sparks of engagement in posts that hitherto would be en route to oblivion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yea, the manual nature of this is clearly limiting, not just with keeping up with the posts but also keeping up with members changing skill sets and interests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence enters automation :)
