                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The loop over issue tickets, code changes, tests, test results normally is in sync. The end user documentation often is not in sync with this loop. There should be methods and tools to change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current code just sketches one approach for one part of the problem.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        it focusses just on the .feature files of bdd tests and isn't flexible/configurable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the output is not really nice
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the workflow is hacky
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    But the person in charge of keeping the end user documentation in sync gets a report about
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        new .features files -&gt; probably a new feature to include in the documentation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        deletetd .features files -&gt; probably a feature to remove from  the documentation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        changed .features files -&gt; most likely a feature that has to be changed in the documentation
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    One shortcoming is, that remote files currently ars shown as tmp files. That can be fixed with more work.
Unchanged features are not reported as that would be a waste of time. If wanted taht can be changed with more work.

                <p>
                    The idea used  is to (mis)use git difftool -y --extcmd /path/to/customDiffToolThatCreatesTheReport not for diffing but for reporting.

                    Find out about that a  external difftool can be used and what parameter values the external difftool gets.
