                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is no system that manages the number of drugs consumed across all the health facilities in the state.

                    Project Description:
A simple web based app for tracking the movement of drugs/vaccines within the local government areas in Kaduna State.
-That means there's a central store which houses all drugs/vaccines sent in to the state. 
-The drugs/vaccines are then registered first and different quantities (Drug name, Quantity, LGA, Hospital Name, Date and Time, Location) which are captured during the distribution are allocated to sub stores.
-This app also keeps tracks of staff login to check mate absenteesm from work.
-As soon as a staff logs in the time is registered.
-It also captures blog posts which covers news of drugs and vaccines available and where.
