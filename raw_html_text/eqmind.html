                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More than 152,000 children in Harris County are living with mental illness.  Early identification and treatment of mental health disorders in youth is critical, but most children go undiagnosed until a crisis occurs, which can severely compromise their long-term ability to achieve a healthy and successful life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Schools struggle to meet the behavioral health needs of their students. Counselors face difficulties providing appropriate levels of mental health services to students; teachers lack experience in recognizing early signs of mental health issues and oftentimes cannot identify available services in the community; and financial restraints keep many schools from adequately meeting the needs of students with mental health problems who are not eligible for services under federal law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clearly, waiting until children are in crisis and need to be hospitalized or incarcerated is not an economical or effective solution to this problem. Successful, evidence-based prevention, early intervention, and treatment programs can literally save children&rsquo;s lives.

                    We believe that teaching students Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is the solution.

                <p>
                    Our solution teaches students introspection and skills for mindful emotional regulation.
It also provides counselors ability to identify at risk students.
Ultimately, providing data for future program development.
