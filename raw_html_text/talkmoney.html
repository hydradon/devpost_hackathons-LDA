                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our friends was misled into believing that Apple Card had a low-interest rate and amazing benefits because they did not read the terms and conditions text. We decided to help solve this important issue by using NLP to automatically simplify and obtain the main points of terms and conditions texts.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TalkMoney uses NLP to read + analyze the terms of services of companies that offer financial services and summarizes it for people to understand

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Training the model was incredibly hard as we only had a couple of hours. We had to constantly watch over it while we were training it. We also had to do some manual work to differentiate between "important" and "less important" information.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TalkMoney
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TalkMoney was only trained on 1 PDF. For now, we can train TalkMoney with more PDFs and in the future, we can possibly use TalkMoney for financial documents such as the quarterly earnings of public companies
