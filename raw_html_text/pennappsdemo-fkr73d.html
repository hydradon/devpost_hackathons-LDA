                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ask a student: do you know Van Gogh's art? Of course. Do you know advanced trig or Euler&rsquo;s formula? Nah...not really a math student. Some students fear advanced topics in math. Current Apps offer lecture and practice problems at various levels. However, none intuitively shows the beauty of mathematics. TechArt combines art design and math to demonstrate the beauty and application of math. In doing so, it connects quantitative and qualitative, hard and soft, as well as technology and humanity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TechArt has two parts. First, it allows users to draw the edges of designated symmetric graphs. It generates a model based on users' drawing. Also, it is a mystery curve random generator. It generates new designs and allows users to save them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I implemented a function presented in IEEE journal's article: "The Mystery Curve: A Signal Processing View". The equation c(t)=a1*exp(i*r1*t)+a2*exp(i*r2*t)+a3*exp(i*r3*t) generates hugely different graphs by changing the 6 variables.
For the random design generator, I ran the SelectCurve file to select designated curves and their corresponding points. The points are saved and loaded into a showcase class.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing the desired symmetric graphs was time-consuming. 
Implementing the Gauss-Newton Algorithm.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It worked!
Our previous group project didn't work out and I had to pivot late Saturday night:/ but still did it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Embracing interdisciplinary subjects. It's really fun! Also, I tried to use javascript earlier but found Matlab was much easier to use and test when it comes to more complex math functions.
                    <br>
                    Persistence is key.
