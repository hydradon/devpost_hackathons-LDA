                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide a powerful tool for budding scholars and ravenous learners where they may gather customized, tailored information based on their learning style: visual, auditory, kinetic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hone collects user inputted information from a quick, ten-question survey to determine the user's most preferred learning style. The server returns a bar graph that details the user's learning type visually. Afterwards, all search inputs would be personalized specifically for the user, based on a search engine algorithm. The algorithm will sift through the most relevant search results of the user inputted query; the resulting websites will be sorted into an order based on image, video, and word count. A well organized user interface allows the user to pick and choose the sites that they wish to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Python, HTML5, CSS3, Google Search API, and the flask package to program this working prototype. The flask package was paramount in connecting the Python logic with visual HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Along the process of developing our hack, we encountered several hurdles ranging from implementation of python algorithms into the HTML and CSS based website. Also, we had to learn the most efficient uses of the flask package to help link the different languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest achievement, by far, was exploring the implementations of Python based sorting algorithms used in refining the webpages that are displayed to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we decided to pursue this project, we knew we had to delve deeper in to the Python and HTML uses. We discovered the wide range of utility of Jinja2 and the flask package, and the necessity of their integration in web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking to refine the GUI of Hone to provide an increasingly user-friendly display. Hone could use a few improvements in user accessibility and also, perhaps, tweaks to the algorithm for more accurate personalisation for the user.
