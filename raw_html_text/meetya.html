                    Meetya is a web application, and future mobile application, designed to provide groups of users a seamless way to decide on an activity based on collective interests.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planning for a hangout can sometimes take hours. Just endless arguments of "what to eat", "where to eat", and all sorts of doubts. We decided to come up with a solution to cut this delay time to seconds. Say bye to all the hassles!

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meetya will make meetups simpler and easier. It keeps track of your favorite hangout locations (food, entertainment, activities, clubs, ...) and finds common choices between yours and your buddies. Let's say if all 3 of you have had a history of frequenting at sushi places, Meetya knows what to suggest to you next time you use the app.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website is primarily built using HTML, CSS, Node.js and was hosted on StdLib. FIrebase (google cloud services) was used to store the data, which was generated from user input passed to Here.com API. All user interests were compared using the Indico API which provided a text/sentiment analysis service.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced a number of obstacles and challenges during our project implementation. Connecting the Node.js backend to our JavaScript front end was a major challenge. We had to go through a pretty big learning curve to get familiar with manipulating data in Firebase databases. Utilizing multiple API's while keeping our application robust was our hardest task.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we could pick up so many new languages, frameworks and API&rsquo;s in such a short time span has made us really proud of ourselves. We were fortunate to be working with such a cohesive and talented team and help each other overcome challenges and grow as a hacker and also as a person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that coding efficiently, teamwork, time-management and seamless communication between group members is of utmost importance. We also learned how to use API's, integrate multiple API&rsquo;s into one application and deploy web-apps. We believe we all learned more due to the bonding we had at Hack Western and we believe that working in steps to achieve a number of small goals are the key to satisfying results.

                    What's next for Meetya
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once this semester&rsquo;s exam period is over, we are hoping to build up on Meetya&rsquo;s current version and fix existing bugs and add a lot more cool features (mobile app, more categories).
