                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project comes from combining my love for machine learning, with my actual work. Currently, I'm a researcher here, and I model neurons. I've always wanted to apply machine learning in this field, but never had time to do it at work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses a reinforcement learning algorithm that attempts to use only an extracellular voltage to force the gate value(s) into a specific state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the reinforcement learning algorithm from scratch. Its a simple algorithm, but it works well enough for a demo. I chose to do this over using a known machine learning algorithm because I wanted to know what was going on under the hood. The interface between python and NEURON was something I had done before, so making it again was relatively simple. Then I used most of the code from work to run the specific simulations. I didn't remake this code simply because it is not the focus of the project.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having to remember how to get through all the random quirks of python.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to create my own reinforcement learning algorithm. I was able to successfully force a gate value into a desired state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even a simple reinforcement learning algorithm can still be effective in some scenarios.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Testing more gates, and seeing if setting multiple gates into specific values is possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Being able to test hypothesis that try and explain the relationship between conduction block and gating values.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Optimization. A better reinforcement learning algorithm, and testing networks in parallel instead of serial.
