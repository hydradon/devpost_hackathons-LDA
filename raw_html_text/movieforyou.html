                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever sat in front of the television, opened Netflix, then scrolled through movies endlessly until you finally give up. Well we created a website to solve this suffering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You create an account on our website and once logged in, you pick which movies you like and which movies you don't. Based on this, our backend AI recommends movies for the user. Then, you can also interact  with other users about the movies you watched by posting about them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript, html and css for the front end. We used flask and python for the server side and login authentication. The AI that recommends the movies was built using python, more specifically the sklearn and pandas libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very hard to program the AI to be efficient. We also had trouble connecting python functions with the javascript and the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our authentication system. It is beyond complete and works perfectly. We are also proud of building our first recommending type AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work a lot with the backend, how to use flask and servers to create an proper authentication system. We also learned to program a recommending type AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MovieForYou
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to increase the efficiency of the AI that recommends the movies. Also it would be great to widen our database by adding the latest movies and even tv shows in he future.
