                    ReadMe is an android app (at the moment) that takes advantage of Google's Firebase text recognition
 API in order to do real-time text translation to dyslexic friendly typeface using the phone camera.
 In addition, ReadMe is able to read gallery images, relaying them to the user by text-to-speech and
 dyslexic friendly typeface. The design of the application is  focused around a color-blind palette
 and large, hard to miss buttons to get users straight to the purpose of the app: to help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ReadMe currently supports Latin-based languages, including English, French, and Spanish, in both OCR and text-to-speech.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of right now, ReadMe is compatible with Android 10, Android Pie, and past versions as well.

                    ReadMe was created initially at Hack @ Brown 2020 by Joe Han, Jeremy Chen, Jason Ho, and Steven Cheung.

                    We were inspired to create an app to address accessibility issues using readily available technology. We noticed that there was a lack of a unified platform to use text recognition software for the purpose of visual assistance for those with myopia, dyslexia, etc. so we designed an app to fill that void.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We faced major challenges learning to develop on the Android platform. In particular, we had a lot of issues with backwards-compatibility with outdated library resources. There was a lot of outdated documentation that made it difficult for us to make all parts of our program compatible.
