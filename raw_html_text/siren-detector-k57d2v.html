                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several years ago, I became friends with someone who was deaf.  Seeing him have the ability to drive in a car and be completely independent inspired me.  The difficulty of driving a car with only visual cues makes driving that much harder for the deaf community, and I wanted to make something that could help level the playing field on the road for them!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This device listens for high audio levels and notifies the individual when the audio level threshold is exceeded.  The notification system is two parts: a text message is sent to the user's phone, and flashing LED's turn on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a microphone sound sensor module for sound detection.  I then wired the module into an analog input of an Arduino Uno.  I wrote Arduino code that sent a UART (a serial communication protocol) signal to my laptop, where I had a Python script listening in on the same UART baud rate.  This Python code then sends a text message to my phone (via a Twilio Python library).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't realize the microphone sound sensor module I bought doesn't work for detecting sound frequencies (rather than just loudness), so I tried to make an amplifier circuit that utilized a generic condenser microphone from the hardware lab.  Unfortunately, the only condenser microphone in the lab broke, and I wasn't able to finish the circuit in time.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a working proof of concept!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to utilize a Twilio library for Python!  I also learned about the underlying technologies of audio amplifiers, despite me not able to finish the amplifier circuit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Siren Detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would love to get a higher quality microphone and use a digital signal processor (such as a dsPIC33) to filter out specific frequencies.  I would also like to train a machine learning model that could distinguish between various noises (sirens, car honks, dogs barking, etc.) and thereby send different notifications to the user based on the sound profile.  Having a device to hook up to the steering wheel that notifies the user through vibration would also be helpful.
