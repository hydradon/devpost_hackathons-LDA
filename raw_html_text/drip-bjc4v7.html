                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a growing concern for the future of our world due to climate change, we intend to mitigate the issues involved with this by supporting the agricultural side - farmers. In order to help grow a stronger crop yield, support farmers, and, more importantly, reduce the chances of droughts and carbon dioxide emissions. As we observed the world sustaining many issues related to these problems, we realized that if we could create a personalized farmer system to analyze farmland data, it would greatly benefit the growth of the farmland by decreasing chances of drought and ultimately saving water usage!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drip is an innovative platform that allows farmers to seamlessly survey their agricultural land and locate key factors such as irrigation issues, low crop yield, and disease growth. By taking in aerial image data from real-time satellites/drones, we transfer this into the processing part of the application which uses machine learning. All of the data is uniquely synced up using the power of IoT and ExpressJS (backend). The streamlined system allows farmers to take precautionary measures to significantly reduce the risks of drought and CO2 emissions.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode for the front end of the application. We used machine learning with Python for the image processing portion. To send the processed data and power the IoT devices we used Express JS for the server side.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into various challenges in identifying what features/frameworks to adopt for this project, as there were many options. Additionally, figuring out the conceptual part of the machine learning/processing phase of the application proved to be difficult.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is important to pick a defined set of frameworks to work with.

                    What's next for drip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, Drip plans to focus on third world countries and drought-prone areas. Additionally, it seeks to advance its processing capabilities by adding on new key data factors that will ultimately increase its overall efficiency.  Finally, Drip will improve it's VR Technology by incorporating new VR 3D Imaging.
