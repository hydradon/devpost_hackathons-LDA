                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wrote a python script to scrape the recipes we required. We then created an android app which would allow the user to answer questions as prompted regarding the type of food which they desired. The app was written in java and using the retrofit library to make calls to our custom restful api. The api was in charge of communicating with our database and retrieving information which was then displayed in the android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A large challenge we faced was implementing the dynamic options for the user to choose from for each question. We had to make calls to the api quite frequently and keep track of previous answers which took us a great deal of time to properly design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scraping the data was also a not trivial task as there were many we had to parse through to get all of the information that we required.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how precise our answers are. When using the app, we got results which fit our specifications very well and discovered foods that we would not have known about otherwise!
