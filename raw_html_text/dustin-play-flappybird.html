                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have two days in Tiger hack, So I decided to start learning Machine Learning over youtube and Google
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply play the game Flappy bird
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I clone a flappy bird game (via pygame) from Github (
                    <a href="https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird
                    </a>
                    )
By simplify the game and re-editing the input. I create an AI (Dustin) and lets him learn how to play the game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to learn something over youtube in just 2 days. But it work out nicely. I test out Dustin and lets him train himself overnight. He took all of my processing power, and I have to force restart a lot of time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After 16 hours of learning, (from 0 points, Dustin make it to the 7 point his highest high score and no longer burning my potatoes computer when he learning. This means that I just learn how ML work, in just 2 days, that is an amazing achievement already
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    that ML is not that hard and it does not require a powerful machine to run. 
Sometimes, without appropriate equipment, It is necessary to improvise and improve algorithm to make my program run smoothly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dustin play flappybird
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ML seems is challenging and I still have a lot of things to do. I wonder if I can help Dustin train himself to recognize fake new over the internet. That would be a great project.
