                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to join charitable organizations and make a social change, but didn't know where to start. Oftentimes had to turn to social media and search to fine opportunities, but didn't have that option.

                    We decided to use a content-based filtering algorithm to find the organizations that are most relevant to users given their interests and skills.
