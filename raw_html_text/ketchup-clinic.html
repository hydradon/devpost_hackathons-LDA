                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spending a week in rural mountain village in Nicaragua as a Global Health Outreach representative and witnessing the detrimental consequences of limited hospital access and lack of medical checkups on the villagers inspired us to develop Ketchup Clinic. By creating an affordable web application that allows villagers to record their vital medical data and send their medical concerns to nearby hospitals, our team hopes that Ketchup Clinic will help people like my dear friends in Nicaragua get appropriate medical advice and treatment in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ketchup Clinic is a web application that allows users (people in remote areas) to record their medical status with equipment such as blood pressure monitor and arduino pulse sensor, and send their medical condition and concerns to clinicians in nearby hospitals in the city. Clinicians are able to look at incoming sessions from their patients in remote areas and give appropriate medical advice or ask them to book an appointment at the hospital.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end implementation of our web application using javascript and html/ css. It utilizes libraries such as jquery to serve different web pages based on the user's profile and actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Arduino component consisted of a pulse sensor and a circuit that contained a component that can sense the temperature. The information from the sensors was displayed with an LCD. Existing libraries for the Arduino were leveraged to facilitate the programming of the hardware and increase the time-efficiency of development.

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The libraries and frameworks available for working with hardware components such as Arduino boards and websites in conjunction, were very restrictive. They reduced our ability to program the hardware components, forcing us to find and learn alternate ways to program and control the microcontroller.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Applying our skills to develop our own solution to a problem that we encountered in our lives, especially a problem that impacts many people around the world.

                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gained further experience in user interface design, collaboration in software projects and the frameworks available for interfacing hardware components with web technologies.

                    What's next:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connect Arduino component to a blood pressure sensor to make the product more portable. Build a mobile application to make it easier for patients and healthcare providers to access the data, and make the product even more portable.
