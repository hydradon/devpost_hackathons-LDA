                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I attended the Lightning Conference in Berlin last month, where I spoke with several other programmers about lnurl. I expressed my disagreement with the idea behind it - mainly that it should be implemented in the BOLT protocol layer instead. But I was convinced by the others' arguments and support of the lnurl specification and ideas. So I started this project and have since gotten it to a usable state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a node.js implementation of the lnurl specification. Including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        encode a URL as bech32-encoded lnurl string
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        decode lnurl bech32-encoded string
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        run an HTTPS web server that supports the lnurl spec (channelRequest, withdrawRequest, auth/login)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    lnurl-node is built with node.js and depends on a few other open-source projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The lnurl specification is still being developed and clarified so it's a bit of a work-in-progress. I've been in communication the past few weeks with the other programmers working on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How quickly I was able to get the project in a usable state and that other programmers are already using it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Listening and understanding the needs of other programmers who might use this and how to collaborate to develop/clarify a specification that others might implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for lnurl-node
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve testing, safety and security; continue to improve the specification and the lnurl-node project itself while developing my other projects that depend on it.
                </p>
