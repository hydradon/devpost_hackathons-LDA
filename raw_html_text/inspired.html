                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Goal-setting on your own sucks. To-do lists are left blank or are perpetually ignored. Calendars are oppressive and fail to capture progression. The most successful achievers are those that are supported and pressured positively by other people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You indicate your goals, updating your progress as necessary. People see your goals and send you words of encouragement (or tough love!). You do the same for them.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not knowing Swift. I've maintained iOS apps as part of a team (internship), but never built one from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent more than half the time working through tutorials. The amount of features accomplished are rather minimal, but by coding the app with proper principles, I'm more confident that I will continue this project after Bitcamp.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polish the UI, connectivity with FB, improve the interaction and suggestion models.
