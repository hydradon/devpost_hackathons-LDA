                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just had our last week of school and tons of assignments due. During this time we often asked friends in our classes how much progress they had made and what issues they were struggling with (especially on our 209 assignment haha). We wanted to know what progress we should have made and what common pitfalls we would encounter because it helped us know what we should be doing and when, and what issues we would have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a simple collaborative progress sharing app. Our real time, responsive web app allows users to create a "task" or "project" and assign progress checkpoints. The app creates a "map" (that looks like a subway line) and then the creator can invite people to join the "room". On the left side of the line, each node has a title of what the accomplishment is. On the right side of the node are emojis, each representing a user (all unique, and chosen by each user when joining the room). If you select a node, you will get detailed information on the description of the checkpoint, who has gotten to that node (their written nametags too, not just emoji icons), and when they got there. Each person who has gotten to a checkpoint can also indicate what issues they had at that checkpoint. You will also be able to indicate you have achieved that checkpoint, so long as you have achieved every checkpoint prior to that. People in the room who are not the creators can suggest additional checkpoints or edits to existing checkpoint descriptions with the suggest feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Vue.js framework, and a Firestore database. We took design cues from Duolingo, and subway maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating our Firestore database with our Vue framework was a challenge, since we were dealing outdated node modules for quite a bit before we realized that the tutorial we used was old.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy that we came up with what we believe is a relevant and personally useful application design that can have many use cases and be collaborative.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We continued to learn about the pains of CSS, and dealing with issues of implementation in a Firestore database.

                    Although we are achieving the very basics of our idea in this project submission, we are excited for some of the opportunities we can see in the future. We would really want to be able to add gamifcation to our application. Some ways in which we could do this is by adding a point system, where you get more points if you achieve an checkpoint within a certain interval of other people (ie working in sync) or you could get more points by responding to issues people have at checkpoints (ie supporting peers). Sound effects would also be nice. A far off future idea would be having non linear progress maps, where you could achieve certain groups of checkpoints without referencing everything else before.
