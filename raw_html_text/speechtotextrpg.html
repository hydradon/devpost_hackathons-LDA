                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us on the team play role playing games, but are frustrated by the tedium of resource management. We hoped to create a program that could understand what we were saying and adjust our inventory accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program takes input from a variety of configuration files and changes the quantities based on specified voice commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google's speech recognition API and a variety of python file readers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google's API runs into issues when the internet is slow, and we were not able to implement a GUI due to time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of getting speech to text working and learning how to use Git.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were excited to learn about Google's cloud services, Git, and advanced python techniques.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SpeechToTextRPG
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more time, we would implement a GUI and a hex-board component.
