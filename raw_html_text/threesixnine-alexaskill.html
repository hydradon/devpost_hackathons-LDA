                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa store didn't seem to offer a counting type of game and 3 6 9 is a fun counting game that I used to play as a child. However, because the timing/speed aspect cannot be precisely controlled, a multiplication aspect was added, which was an educational boost to the game as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How to Play
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three Six Nine is a counting game where each member of the game takes a turn counting by one. However, in these specific scenarios, the player must say "quack" rather than the number.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The number contains a digit that contains a three, six, or nine
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The number is divisible by three
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the number contains more than one digit that contains a three, six, or nine, the user must say "quack quack"
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Example: 1, 2, clap, 4 ... 11, clap, clap, 14
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can be played either with one person or with as many people as you want by simply saying either "Ask Three Six Nine to play" or "Ask Three Six Nine to play with {numFriends} friends."
                </p>

                    As it was my first Alexa skill that I built, I had a difficult time understanding how I would implement this game. There were no other examples that I could find that was centered around a counting game. For a while, I couldn't figure out how to account for when the user didn't give Alexa any input.

                    Being my first Alexa skill, I'm proud that I stuck with my original idea and managed to figure out an implementation of the game for Alexa.

                        Nothing much more. I will be looking to developing new Alexa Skills hoping to use the Echo buttons.
