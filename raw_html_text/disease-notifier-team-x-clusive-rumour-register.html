                    A need to attain these outcomes -
&bull; Collection and recording of disease notifications, including the analysis of data and monitoring of disease trends.
&bull; The follow-up and investigation of cases of notifiable diseases (in line with local and national guidelines) and the  implementation of disease control measures to prevent the spread of these diseases in the community.
&bull; Investigation and management of disease outbreaks.
&bull; Informing and developing disease prevention and control strategies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does &ndash;
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this project an app is made in which a users provides their location then they will get notification any time a nearby disease is registered. 
If they are aware of the disease spreading around their area then they will verify the disease thus increasing the count of number of users who are aware. So if number will reach certain level than a high alert can be declared.
If they are unaware of the disease then they can get the information of the vital disease and they can get the level of danger by analysing the number of people verified it.
If they get to know that a disease is spreading which is not yet registered anywhere then the can register the very disease with information about area.

                    How I built it &ndash;
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build it by using the following features - 
&bull; Google Places API &ndash; To take user&rsquo;s location and in a meantime notify them about the nearby diseases. 
&bull; FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) &ndash; To send downstream notification
&bull; Network Volley &ndash; To request the server and to get response from server using POST method
&bull; Android Studio &ndash; Platform for making app using JAVA language
&bull; PHP - Backend
                </p>

                    What's next for Disease Notifier (Team X-clusive , Rumour Register)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its ann initiative to modernize the systems and processes used to receive nationally notifiable disease data to provide more comprehensive, timely, and higher quality data than ever before for public health decision making. So that we can create awareness among the people and do some good to the society.
