                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try some new tech. Gain more experience. Learn as much as we could for our first hackathon. 
Pebble seemed like the way to go. 
We wanted to build an app for the Pebble smartwatch that takes advantage of its fitness capabilities.  We also know that we are way more likely to commit (a follow through) to a workout if you have a friend with you, but sometimes it isn't always feasible to run with other people in the same location. We intended this app to let you virtually run with your friends (a race!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was designed to track your speed, and distance as you run. If you chose, you can "run with a friend". This app was supposed to collect real time data for both you and your friend. On your screen you would see your stats for the run as well as your friends; allowing for a race between the two of you without your friend being physically with you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built mainly in cloudpebble, tested with two pebble devices and android smartphones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of difficulty working with the gps and using that to find the distance traveled (we found it was not accurate enough). We also struggled with integrating the script written in the pebble java-script environment with the android side of the development (which was supposed to handle the data transfer between you and your friend).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How fast we learned and our perseverance - sticking with a project and trying different strategies to accomplish a problem. A lot (understatement) of problem solving was involved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned javascript, Android Studio, cloudpebble, pebble.js, and a whole lot of teamwork. We learned that pebble development has many facets, and although C is tougher, it makes integration easier and allows far more doors to be opened. We learned how complicated android app development can quickly become, and that simple solutions are a developers best friend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Running Together
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Running Together is to create a catchy one word name like Facebook or Twitter. Also we need to add many core features and implement actual real time data. Finally, we need way more flashy features and microtransactions to keep the loyal user base hooked.
