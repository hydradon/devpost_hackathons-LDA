                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When someone is in a new area they have never been before, let's say a new campus, they have trouble finding their classes and sometimes get lost. When using the maps on campuses it is usually only a picture of the full campus and you have to find where your classroom is by guessing a direction to go in around the building, We wanted to make it simpler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a simple web app that is an intractable map of the UC Merced campus. When you click on a building it brings up a separate picture of that buildings blueprint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using Basic HTML on dreamweaver we created a simple web app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to add multiple pictures to each building on the Map (aka all of the floors of the building)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement a javascript so that clicking on the buildings does not take you to a different page but instead pops open a separate image over the original map
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement a javascript and how to create a simple web app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ucMaps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal is to eventually figure out how we can add a gallery of photos to each clickable building so that we could have every single floor, and maybe add a GPS feature to it eventually making it a phone app instead of a web app. We would also like to eventually fine tune it so that each image that pops up is the same size and maybe we could even do this for multiple UC's so that freshman don't have as hard of a time finding their classes.
