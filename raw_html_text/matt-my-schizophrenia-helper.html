                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Schizophrenia is a scary disorder. I saw a video that simulates it and was absolutely terrified with what I witness. I wanted to create an app that helped those with it in some way and so Matt was born. He is a trustworthy friend that will tell you if a person (you are talking to or see) is real or not. I spoke with a doctor about the app and he suggested making it similar to a human friend that the patient can trust because that is how most therapy works for the disease in real life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It acts like a friend that tells people if someone is real or not. Using machine learning it confirms (via facial detection for now) whether there is actually a person there or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift + Google Cloud Vision API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Haven API wasn't good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works. Someone who worked at Google said it was the best use case of their API they had heard of, that made me really happy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The technology is really awesome, I can't wait to see where we take it.
