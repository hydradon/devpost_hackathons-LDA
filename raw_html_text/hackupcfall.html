                    We wanted to give people a tool with which they could

                        learn a new language
                    </strong>
                    or teach it by meeting new people through a chat. The purpose is to make learning more fun because of the
                    <strong>
                        interaction with strangers
                    </strong>

                    is a chatting website specialized in learning languages. It connects two people interested in learning the
                    <strong>
                        same language
                    </strong>
                    or the one spoken by the other one and lets them chat for
                    <strong>
                        an agreed time
                    </strong>
                    about a
                    <strong>
                        specific topic
                    </strong>
                    . In the end, the score is calculated from 0 to 30 according to complexity, orthographic correctness and relevance to the subject.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had
                    <strong>
                        4 courses of action
                    </strong>
                    :
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Firstly, designing the chat interface by using node.js and socket.io.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Secondly, we created a class structure in order to organize all the information from the different sections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Thirdly, we had to develop a scoring system which would measure the language level.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, we designed a web interface with HTML and CSS which is the application interface.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We discovered that the most difficult part was putting together all the pieces that we had in the end. We had four structures that worked perfectly but we had to figure out a way to communicate between them. This was the part that was the hardest for us because we didn't know how to communicate between processes, such as connecting HTML with Node.js and connecting a C++ file  with a javascript file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to sort out many of the difficulties and each of us faced a
                    <strong>
                        new programming language
                    </strong>
                    of which we had little knowdlege.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's possible to stay up all night learning a new programming language and that communication between processes is much less documented than many programming languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dance the Cha Cha Chat!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps will be completing the
                    <strong>
                        other languages' dictionaries
                    </strong>
                    , adding the possibility of having a contact list or
                    <strong>
                        adding friends
                    </strong>
                    . The goal is that people who don't have the time or the money to learn a language can start by having fun with our web application.
