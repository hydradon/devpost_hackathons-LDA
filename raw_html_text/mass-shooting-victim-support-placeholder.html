                    </em>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can take preemptive action to keep themselves safe and communicate with loved ones in case they're involved in a shooting. They can:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Set emergency contacts for quick communication during a crisis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set their own important medical information, such as blood type and special treatment instructions, to be displayed on the lock screen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Access a bevy of knowledge on preventing and staying safe during mass shootings, in order to create an Emergency Action Plan.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    If caught in a shooting, Shooter Shield can be life saving. Once they've gotten to cover, the user can use Shooter Shield to:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Send an SOS - A press of a button queues up 911 on the user's phone. The application tells the user what information is useful to the police. Another press sends a message to the user's emergency contacts, with status (Safe, In Danger, or Injured) and attached GPS coordinates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Review survival tips &amp; first aid procedures - The user can quickly review advice for what to do during a shooting, and access first aid  information for common gunfire-caused injuries.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        See a map with key information such as 
their friends' locations, police and paramedic locations, and routes to the nearest hospital
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Get alerts on the situation as they happen.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    <strong>

                <p>
                    After the user or someone they care about is caught in a shooting, Shooter Shield has resources they can use to recover emotionally and financially, and take action on preventing future shootings. Users can:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>

                <p>
                    We initially aimed at a React Native app utilizing Expo to create an app capable of running on both Android and iOS. Unfortunately, after multiple technical difficulties, we ended up creating a simple screen-jumping prototype in

                    Bringing together the plentiful but widely scattered resources available to shooting victims, and hopefully saving lives.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Building apps in such a short time frame can be quite frustrating. Familiarizing ourselves better with the languages of app construction would have been wise. Also, bring warm socks and blankets because some hackathons set their thermostats to 'arctic chill.'

                    We'd love to build a fully functioning app with complete access to the resources our research turned up. Our next steps would include:
