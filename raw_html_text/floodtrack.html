                </h2>
                <p>
                    Water tables in Ireland are measured from c 1900 maps and local knowledge updates are not a reliable data source to track real time water data for property and land owners at risk. Also, the agricultural community are reliant on historical intergenerational knowledge transfer for reliable soil optimization practices.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sensor network would be build measure and learn from the water tables and help to model and predict to help with water management and soil optimization

                    This data could be of immense importance to planners and researchers to better understand how the citizens interact with landscapes, ecosystems and their local services.
