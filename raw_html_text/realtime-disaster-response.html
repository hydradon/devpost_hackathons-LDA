                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The immediate and long-term impact of any disaster, man-made or natural, is hard to quantify. Media coverage highlights the immediate aftermath as people and businesses directly affected by the event deal with their new reality. But after the journalists go home, recovery efforts remain.

                <p>
                    The App aims to assist rescue team from miles away on the ground to make a difference. Besides that, the App helps victims to ease the communication and logistics breakdowns that happen during disasters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    (1) The first part is a text message communication tool in case the network is too bad to use, or the network system is totally down and for people who don't even have smartphones. For example, by using the tool, victims can request route to a safe place and retrieve navigation. 
And they can post their request to public twitter just by a single text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) For the second part, we aim at big data virtualization to coordinate damage assessment and relocation efforts. Through data shown on the App, it&rsquo;s easy to determine where medical staff is most urgently needed, or where and what support teams and supplies are needed most.
For recurring disasters (such as in areas prone to wildfires or hurricanes), pull from previous recovery data to refine current recovery activities. 
In addition, we plan to create real-time maps that identify what is happening in the affected area. It could be used to identify where grassroots support is available, and which areas need formalized help.

                    To achieve those functions, we would utilize Microsoft bing Map API, Twitter Fabric API, Twilio and IBM Bluemix to implement the client system.
