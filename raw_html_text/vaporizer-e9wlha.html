                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dani Vertiz is an active listener of the Vaporwave microgenre. Chimiziri "Will" Mbionwu has worked with audio engineering as a hobby, and Daniel Garzon enjoys to listen to music in his free time. Without much experience with audio file manipulation through programming, we thought it'd be fun to work on a Vaporwave converter web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web application prompts the user to input the name of a song, artist, and a .WAV file. When the form is submitted, the audio file is sent from the client-side to our Flask server. Within our POST request, we then send the file object to our C++ audio library where majority of the magic happens. The library is able to trim, repeat, add reverb, slow down, and change pitch to parts of the file or the entire file, if desired.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from placing first, our biggest accomplishment was creating an applicaiton that we all had fun building. Although the experience was very tiring, we didn't feel like competing was a burden because as a team, we were heavily invested in our idea!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of music theory, some of us didn't have much experience with Python's server framework Flask. Also reinforcing frontend knowledge with React, and learning how to parse through and manipulate audio files.
