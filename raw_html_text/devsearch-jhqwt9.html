                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have a formal search engine for developers looking directly for repositories in GitHub. We thought it was a great idea to create a website that can search repositories directly from GitHub and show it to developers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a search engine for GitHub repositories, where you type the words in the text box and the page shows you all the repositories in GitHub that are related to your keyword
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript for all the work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble parsing information for API to work, which took most of the time fixing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with an idea of what to work on quickly, so we could start work on it early. Also, we divided work for each team member and worked on them collaboratively
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about designing/developing a website (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and about APIs. Also, we gained more experience with working on a challenging task in a limited time as a group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DevSearch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next goal for DevSearch is to expand this for other technical queries with a filtering system which only accepts the right codes verified by a certified developer.
