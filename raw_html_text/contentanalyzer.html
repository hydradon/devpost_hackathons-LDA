                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the elections approaching close, it has become increasingly difficult to convey unbiased information to readers of blog posts. The staggering variety of words and phrases have made it extremely intricate to understand what parts of an article are biased and what parts are not. This project aims to utilize Natural Language Processing techniques to classify various fragments of a post into subjective and non-subjective sentences
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project provides a web browser extension using which the user can highlight any segment on a webpage and the extension displays the subjective and non-subjective parts in the highlighted segment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    The project is divided into two major modules
                </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Browser extension
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        REST API for the backend carry out NLP Sentiment Analysis and classifying subjective statements in an article
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The Browser extension is implemented using Javascript and HTML and CSS and would call the REST API when a segment of text is highlighted and the mouse cursor is released.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The REST API is developed using Python - Django. Currently, the API has only one endpoint that can be called via a POST request with the following name
                    <code>
                        text
                    </code>
                    in the request body. The extension upon
                    <code>
                        mouseover
                    </code>
                    collects the highlighted text and sends it to the REST API. The API utilizes a model previously trained by leveraging Sentiment Analysis using
                    <code>
                        Naive Bayes
                    </code>
                    to tag each sentence with a subjectiveness level with a certain confidence. The model classifies each sentence in a given paragraph as subjective with a certain degree of accuracy. A threshold is set on the accuracy of the subjectiveness level which filters any non-subjective sentences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, the API is hosted on Heroku under the url
                    <code>
                        https://hackutd-cognizant-nlp.herokuapp.com/myapp1/
                    </code>
                    The API expects a POST request with only one field in the body
                    <code>
                        text
                    </code>
                    - The content to be analyzed.
A sample response of the API is attached to this submission.
