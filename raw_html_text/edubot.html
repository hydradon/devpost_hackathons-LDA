                    Every 5 minutes (a minute count that is divisible by 5), EduBot will announce the top 3 most frequent words and commands used while being alive in the Twitch chat channel. This was going to be used for machine learning/AI algorithms to further interact with users, but it would've taken longer than the allotted time given for SD Hacks.

                    Doesn't have any functionality in this app as of right now but it is in the works. Wanted to use DocuSign for any formal agreements between Twitch chat users, most likely in the realm of tutoring services (given its name of EduBot), which I wanted to implement.
