                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We watched a CGPGrey video on machine learning that allowed us to connect the idea to a dating sim. Whichever character fails to win your love gets replaced by a better version of itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far, it gets halfway through the first day (the tutorial). We got the hang of Ren'Py, though, so after today, we should be able to write up the rest of it much faster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ren'Py is a visual novel IDE. It's simple... and frustrating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ren'Py hates loops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built something!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ren'Py and Python. Ren'Py supports Python. We also learned how to configure Notepad++ to run .rpy files. It was a slightly involved process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DatingSim
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A pseudo-machine learning mechanism and proper endings.
                </p>
