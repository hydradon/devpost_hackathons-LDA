                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the Canadian national college health assessment conducted in 2016, nearly
                    <strong>
                        two-thirds
                    </strong>
                    of students reported experiencing &ldquo;overwhelming anxiety". Thus, we saw this as an opportunity to create and develop a software application that students can use to improve their daily mental health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application has two important functions: a mood tracker and a resource page. When you open the application, you are asked whether you are feeling content or upset. Based on your choice, you will be given tailored affirmations and exercises to improve your mood. Additionally, a resources page will be built that contains the information of the KidsHelpPhone, jack.org, Canadian Mental Health Association, and local counselling services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was built using Swift and design mockups were created on Canva.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our group members have ever coded in Swift before. We also had a lot of other ideas that we wanted to incorporate into the application, such as a chatroom where users would be able to connect with a trained professional. However, when discussing with design and development mentors, they recommended that we focused on the resource portal.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are so proud that we created the start of an application in under 24 hours! :)

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to navigate through multiple pages using Swift, how prevalent of an issue the lack of mental health awareness is amongst this market segment, and how to create mockups of an application using Canva.
