                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envisioned what the future would look like and we saw people looking at themselves in the mirror and choosing which clothing to wear or buy without actually having to physically wear it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon asking a chat bot to try on specific clothing, the chat bot will redirect to a website that let's you try on the clothing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html and css for the website that shows the user the clothing item in front of a webcam. We also used the microsoft bot framework in order to ask chat with a bot and ask it to show the website to try on the clothing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning, we were using a mirror or semi-reflective surface and build a smart mirror. However, we did not have the resources to do so and could not obtain any from nearby stores. We also had some software issue trouble initially starting up the chat bot. E.g. making a simple Hello World function work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being very creative with the obstacles that we faced and because of that creativity,  we made a more practical and accessible application that lets a user try on clothes virtually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New tools and APIs such as javascript, microsoft-botframework and web camera tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mirroar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will implement a smart mirror once we have a reflective surface and a monitor available. We will be able to make the clothing fit better onto the user and improve on scalability.
