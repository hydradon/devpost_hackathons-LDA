                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The EMS system was designed to quickly provide care to individuals. Critical conditions can lead to death in minutes and even seconds, and the system has not always fulfilled the needs of immediate treatment and transport. There are around 400000 licensed EMS providers, increasing at an average rate of 60000 each year. These numbers are not including licensed nurses, medical assistants, etc. who may also be involved to expand emergency care to individuals. If we can get more providers involved, we can guarantee that any person can receive professional and quick medical care, even in rural or underrepresented areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app allows individuals in need of immediate medical care to quickly call for a local provider driving service. Along with this, anyone with medical concerns may also use this as a mode of transportation with an person who can provide immediate care if needed.
                </p>

                    What's next for Ambient
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Establishing an way for those with no access to phones or the internet to be able to use this app, possibly by implementing a "button" in the community which will activate the system.
