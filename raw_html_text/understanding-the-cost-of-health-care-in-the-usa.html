                    How is money allocated in the United Stated to Health Care? The entirety of healthcare spending represents almost 1/3 of our nation's GDP. Yet few people actually understand how money is allocated in the United States. Using an open source data set from data.gov we looked at spending around the 100 most common inpatient services and 30 most common outpatient services. Specifically, we create an interactive visualization for the geographic distributions of discharge rates, charges covered, total payment made and Medicare spending. We subseted this data using many intuitive views and also look at the burden of the different procedures on spending. We were able to achieve a level of specificity that could provide metrics on spending, discharge and care distribution on the single hospital level in a fun easy to use point and click interface.
