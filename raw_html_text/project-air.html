                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've always wanted to be able to experience what it is like to be an air traffic controller, in VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically it's a watered down Air Traffic Control Sim in VR with the Alexa. You can clear planes for landing/takeoff. Prepare them for takeoff/landing. Have them enter holding patterns. And most importantly, prevent them from crashing!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created astar  paths for the planes to follow on the runway, and for takeoff/landing. Used Alexa to change values in a Firebase database. Unity listens for the changes and acts appropriately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase and Alexa don't play well. The desktop we brought could barely run the Vive, so Unity crashed frequently.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity, Alexa, and Firebase
                </p>

                    What's next for Project Air
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more functionality, more types of emergencies, and more ways for the user to interact with the airport.
