                <p>
                    Sketching artists may spend a large amount of time gathering evidence on suspects' appearances from witnesses. They also spend a considerable amount of time perfecting their representations of suspects so that they may look more realistic. We would like to automate much of that process so that artists can start from a descriptive body sketch and a realistic image of a face rather than sketch everything from scratch.

                        Many of us were not familiar with react so we took more time to learn about it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We attempted to use a pre-trained ML model but were met with multiple hurdles. We made a simple PCA based model but its results did not satisfy us (in fact they were scary 0_0). We attempted to use pre-trained models from recent research projects like CA-GAN, but we had trouble with transferring large files to the GPU environment we had access to, which impacted our ability to run the models.
