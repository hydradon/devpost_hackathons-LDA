                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding tutors at MSU is currently painful and tedious. Navigating different class websites and looking for physical fliers in hallways is inefficient, taxing, time demanding, and often unsuccessful. We want to make it easy for tutors and students to find each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TutorTime allows students to post jobs to an internet board. Tutors can look at these jobs that include information such as subject, price, and contact information. Our site is unique as it allows students and tutors to rate each other. This keeps rating honest as the tendency by students is to leave bad reviews for educators whether they are bad or good. Allowing tutors to rate students is the equivalent of allowing Uber drivers to rate their passengers. Both parties know if they are getting someone difficult before committing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built TutorTime on Flask and a Google Cloud Virtual Machine. Flask is a language that integrates HTML and other front end tools with python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going into this hackathon none of our members had made a web application. Our most comfortable languages were C++ and python, which aren't the most popular languages for web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first hackathon any of our team members participated in. This is also the first internet application any of us has made. We are proud to have made our first web application and to have figured out how to get a website up and running and also to learn some front end. We are also proud to have a functioning project at our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned how to use Flask and Google's Virtual Machine environment. Flask is a language that combines python with html to help bring front end development to python. Our website is currently hosted on a Google Virtual Machine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TutorTime
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We look forward to bringing TutorTime to IOS and andriod. We also look forward to adding new features such as built in chat, integrating secure third party payment options, email notifications, improving security, and general functionality and aesthetic of our platform.
