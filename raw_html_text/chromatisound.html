                    ABOUT OUR PROJECT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is Chromatisound, a collection of audio visualization APIs intended to be used by the Hearing Impaired and in music education. Our inspiration for this project came from our desire to share our interest in music with the world in a new and exciting way. We realized that we could accomplish this by translating the characteristics of music (amplitude, pitch, rhythm) into visual and analytical form factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results of our efforts is a UI that procedurally generates an image based on sound snippets called ChromaSound. Our algorithm inputs sound data as amplitude over time and to output the following parameters: shape, size, color, and position as a vector. We use signal processing to identify relavent frequencies within our data and use them to plot a range of colors, shapes, and vector angles. With the signal amplitude dictates the size of the shape and vector magnitude, each sound snippet will generate a completely unique image based on the loudness and pitch of the sounds heard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our other work for this project include two API backends that process sound information in real time, Chordify and VoiceHarmony. Each of these programs performs the fourier transform on small chunks of data at a time, identifing what frequencies are most relevent. Once isolated, the frequencies are fed into a chord recognition API called pychord to determine the musical chord or chord progression the sound data represents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to implement these systems, both sound analysis and visualization, in a webApp to process sound input in real time, creating a new form factor in which sound can be experienced. We hope you found our project interesting, please be sure to let us know what you think!

                    ABOUT US
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a group of high school students from the Haverford School with a shared passion for innovation in software engineering. Our team members, freshmen Elijah Lee and Josiah Somani, junior Alexander Greer, and senior Alex Sun, collectively held experience in graphic and web-app design, signal processing, and data analysis in a host of languages. Our goal in attending this hackathon was to learn as much as we could from the many talented computer scientists and engineers working alongside us, and hopefully create something cool along the way! We hope you take a look through our project and let us know what you think!
