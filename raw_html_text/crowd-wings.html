                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we found, from personal experience, it is super frustrating that there is a large barrier for investments in early-stage startups. These startups required angel investing in order to make the desired impact. However, this level of funding is not available for a normal person that is just excited to invest in a new startup and wants to see this startup succeed. Marketplaces such as Kickstarter allow startups to crowdfund but do not give the crowd a stake in the company, they only provide the finished product. The investors are not part of the decision making of the company.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The CrowdWings platform allows the crowd to not only invest in a company but also to have a meaningful impact on the company development and growth through feedback and decision making. Our company acts as a large angel investor that buys a stake in the company, and investors get a pre-screened view of startups that will most likely have a high return on investment. This way, investors are most likely to profit while involved in the decision making of the company. They will receive updates on company progress continuously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CrowdWings is a Django web app hosted on Azure. Admins post startups to the page and uses are able to invest in individual startups using the PayPal API.

                <p>
                    We were able to successfully integrate our complex system into a web app and host a live functional prototype!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about this new industry of crowdfunding equity. We also learned about UX design through multiple iterations of our interface (and Bananas!).
                </p>

                    What's next for Crowd Wings
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will polish off the website from feedback during the demos. Then we plan to open CrowdWings up to a beta audience. Once we have a minimum viable product and real users we hope to obtain funding to quickly scale into this emerging industry.
