                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of the results of the 2016 presidential election, which occurred a few days prior to the submission of this project, we felt inspired to create a website that allowed people to talk to the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Both of us had limited experience in computer science, and only one of us had attended a hackathon previously. So using our programming skills and the little knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we had, we created "Words That Trump."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply click on the picture of Trump and hear some of his most infamous phrases and statements. Also, try to argue with him by entering a message in the appropriate text area. You'll see what it's like to be Hillary!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, we used Audacity to cut up sound bits from Trump's speeches and rallies and used the mp3 files to make Trump speak.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As stated previously, we both had limited experience in computer science and are far from hackathon experts. Thinking of an idea that was reasonable yet challenging for us took some time, and the actual building and design of the website was difficult because we learned about the languages as we went.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to create something completely different from what we have ever done before. Also, we were able to create something that we were not sure we could do at the beginning of the hackathon. And not to mention, we had a lot of fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and learned how to solve problems on our own and not get discouraged.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Words That Trump
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were to continue with this project, we would like to be able to add more phrases from his speeches. We would also like to add a feature that allows the user to enter a specific phrase that could then be said by Donald Trump!
