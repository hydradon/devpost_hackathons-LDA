                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an adventure game that allowed the player to choose what actions they took.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an adventure game that takes the player through a journey. It takes player input and uses it to make a choice which ultimately changes what type of adventurer the player is. The player can choose between physical and magical attacks, and defeating enemies levels up the player, and the player can choose what type of attacks they want to improve for their own preferred play style.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C++ and multiple functions to simulate a world. The main function runs through the dialogue, and along the way, there is a random chance that the player will encounter an enemy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble coming up with what we wanted to do and we had difficulty combining our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked well together and managed to create something that worked in the end. We made an actual combat system that works and gives the player a choice of what they want to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate and how to use classes.

                <p>
                    Story expansion, GUI, and more options for combat/dialogue.
