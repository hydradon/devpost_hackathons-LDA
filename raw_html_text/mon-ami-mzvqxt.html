                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technology is making our world smaller but also keeping us apart by putting us behind screens. We realize that college students don't have many friends and often don't know how to make them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mon Ami brings users closer together by using the same devices that keeping us apart. It brings "social" media to the real world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first started with an idea. This idea evolved into a Balsamiq mockup. We didn't know about Balsamiq before the Hackathon but we are glad we found it in Slack, it has kept our vision constant throughout the weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was a challenge. All of us are first-time app developers and although we have all dabbled in different programming languages before, we certainly  had a lot of internet tutorials and documents to learn from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of everything we have accomplished this weekend, even the seemingly super simple stuff like getting Android Studio installed correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a mockup in Balsamiq, we learned how to configure system path variables, how to run a virtual Android, how to use Windows Powershell, how to get GPS data, how to send chats, but most importantly, we learned how to ask for help when we needed it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mon Ami
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mon Ami has many niches it can fill. We plan on implementing minigames, event notifications, classifieds, and many more.
