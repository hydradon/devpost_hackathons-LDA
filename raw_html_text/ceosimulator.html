                    Inspiration: I was inspired, in part, by the games like Papa's Pizzeria on coolmath.com, where you become the owner of a business unexpectedly without any real qualifications.

                    What it does: This is a video game where you make decisions as the CEO without much information to go off of. The goal: to not go bankrupt.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I built it using javascript, html, and css

                    What's next for CEOSimulator: Adding more board member characters to introduce the events who will also give you advice. Some of the board members will want you to succeed and will therefore give you good advice a certain percentage of the time, while other board members will deliberately give you bad advice a certain percentage of the time. More events will be added, as well as more outcomes.
