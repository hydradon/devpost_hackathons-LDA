                    There are two major goals of our project. On one side we are providing a way to find a facility that meets an individual's needs. This is accomplished by connecting the facilities together in a central database where they can list what resources they offer, and how much of that is available at the moment. This data is used to map out the facilities and show their current availability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The database is a standard MySQL database that is currently cloud hosted. Mapping is done with Shiny, a web framework on top of R. R is also used for the machine learning techniques used to identify risk factors. Design on the website was done with Twitter Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    R was a new language for most of the people on the team, but it was pretty quickly picked up. The data in the sample dataset also had a lot of missing data. This made it difficult to make the model used for analyzing new data.
