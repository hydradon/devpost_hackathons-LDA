                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When looking into ideas, we really liked the idea of the Retro theme and wanted an idea around that. After brainstorming, we came up with the idea of DJs throwing vinyl records at a group of dancers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the game, you play the DJ at his record table. The aim of the game is to throw vinyls at the dancers in the disco. Every dancer hit gains points, but watch out as they will be throwing song ideas right back. Get hit too many times and you're out!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Art designs were done in Piskels, then taken to Unity where with C++ and Unity the game was built.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, only one of our two members knew how to use Unity from the beginning. It made the work a little bit more challenging in the learning sense and workload.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with Piskel and designing part of own artwork was a lot of fun although not perfect!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both gained more experience in Unity which was awesome.

                <p>
                    Currently, maybe picking it back up afterwards to make it look neater and better setting.
