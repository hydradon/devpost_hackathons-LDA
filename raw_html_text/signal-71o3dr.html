                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Significant amounts of our time is spent consuming media which is affecting our ability to be productive. As university students we found that a substantial proportion of the time we spent procrastinating was attributed to posts on social that were designed to be inherently addictive. However, the only tools available to overcome the time wasted being unproductive on social media were inadequate and didn&rsquo;t address the core problem &ndash; addictive UI designs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although there are various tools available on the chrome extension store to block posts on various different social media platforms, they were mainly focussed on blocking content and also built only for individual platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this, we recognised that it was our responsibility to build a universal tool, which would allow us to address the time wasted on social media and allow users to take back control of their productivity.

                    We take the Signal from the noise by eradicating addictive design patterns on the most popular social media platforms. We want to give users the ability to make good decisions easier and bad decisions harder.
