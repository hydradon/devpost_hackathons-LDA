                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started to implement the routing for a Microsoft HoloLens based navigation project. The other person involved experienced setbacks, and decided to pivot. I had no other ideas for this hackathon so I kept working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It runs Dijkstra's Algorithm against a collection of Unity GameObjects, and draws a path between them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I kept marching slowly forward, through the pain and the tears.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I encountered a malfunctioning build environment, sleep deprivation, and a whole set of non-cooperative vendor provided libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote code I can reuse in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have an idea before arriving at a hackathon. Always keep in mind the complexity of the tools and platform you are building on.
                </p>

                    What's next for Incomplete HoloLens Navigation Experiment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I see myself reusing parts of this project's implementation future Unity based projects.
