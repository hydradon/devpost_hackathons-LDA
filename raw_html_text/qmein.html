                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The long lines and antique sign-in system at Knight Hacks.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Your app has your identity and you scan the QR code of the event. Once you scan the QR, the app goes through the events application and sends your information to their database. It will log you in the event and the time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Logan Lopez is the back bone of the application. He worked with Laravel creating database internal API then using zexing api to scan the QR and all is done with Android-studio.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zexing cannot be run as fragment. Unfamiliarity with fragments. Database issues, and connections issues with back-end server and client app.
                </p>
