                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While auditing a previous project we realized that centralized web2 APIs can be serious security vulnerabilities. Infura is centralized in this way and the volume of transactions going to ethereum through it could cause problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use ipfs as a totally transparent backend filesystem to allow anyone to run their own local client API which access data. This combined with a soft consensus mechanism on the location of the data, which is run through ipfs pubsub to run programs which change the data state of the filesystem. We built a local client api which interacts with the distributed system and provides infura like routes through the localhost. This will make it easy for current projects to port over to our decentralized system.
