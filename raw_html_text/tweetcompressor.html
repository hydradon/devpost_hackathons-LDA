                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tired of seeing long tweets in our timeline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes any tweet with more than 140 characters in the timeline and remove any unnecessary words, as determined by a list of Stop Words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a Chrome extension that listens to changes in the DOM and checks to see if the tweet is over the limit. If so, it replaces the text on the tweet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had used JQuery or had worked with the DOM before this, so learning how to use these things turned out to be harder than we thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of being able to modify the HTML as it got updated by observing the DOM.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use JQuery, how the DOM works, and how Chrome extensions are written.
                </p>

                    What's next for TweetCompressor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's currently a bug with quote tweets, as the two separate parts show up as one tweet that's separated by a link. This causes both tweets to get shortened into one.
