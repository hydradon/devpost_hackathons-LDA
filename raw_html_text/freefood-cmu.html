                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all been there. Stuck on campus doing work, with little time to spare, and even less money. On a campus as big as this, there has to be some extra food lying around somewhere, right? This web app helps you help others (and others help you) not go hungry!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you know of some left over food (after a meeting, or you happen to stumble across some extra food) you can post to the website to let people know where the food is, when it'll be there 'till, and what's available. Or, if you are starving, sign-in and see what food you can get on campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and django to the build the web app. We built on a template provided by Rohan to create multiple pages for the front-end (log-in, register, homepage) as well as the database required for the users and posts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew html or django, so we had to learn as we went. We also forgot to migrate new fields after creating them, which caused the web app to crash, and took a while for us to figure out how to fix it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a website using skills that we didn't have before the hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>

                    Basics of django.

                    What's next for FreeFood @CMU!!!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -make the upvotes/downvotes relate to the user who posted, not just the post, which determines the credibility of the user that posted
-add an API to show on a map where the food is
-add a feature that allows you to post pictures of the food
-automatic deletion of old posts
-user can extend post-life if he/she sees food is not gone yet
-make it so only people with CMU emails can register
