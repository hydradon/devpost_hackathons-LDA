                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking one smart contract and pay multiple parties/wallets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows a transaction to be split into percentage amounts set in the smart contract amongst the parties being paid. For an example, a customer pays for an item, that transaction is then split between the seller of the item and the supplier who provided the goods/service to create the item (i.e. a coffee shop and its supplier of coffee beans).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user initiates a transaction which contains the total amount value. They also specify a duration of time the contract lasts for, and what percentage of the total amount will be sent to different wallets and presses a button to make it run.
This then allows the users that contain the other wallets to accept or ignore  (cancel?) the transaction. If all members accept, the exchange happens.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TBD ???
Attempted with solidity.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE DOING!!!!! None of us know blockchain - so we had to learn as we built.
We didn't know where to start therefore wasted a lot of time figuring shit out.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We understand the base level of ethereum and how it works. We created something with no prior knowledge of blockchain tools/technologies. We survived no sleep and food truck indigestion. We made some awesome network contacts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should have learned how to code in ethereum prior to this hackathon because the educational workshops were too fast and we weren't able to learn and hack at the same time.
