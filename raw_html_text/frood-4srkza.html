                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us enjoy eating food and were amazed by the amount of free food to be found on a college campus if you are just willing to look for it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Android app allows CMU students to easily find food events hosted by various organizations, and lets those student organizations and companies to advertise their events. Users can either find food with the map/list, or post their event using a form. The app shows markers on a campus map for each event and displays a short pop-up with the organization name, the food provided, and date and time of the event. It also has a list display in which more information, such as price and extra comments from the organizers are shown.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to code the app, and MapBox for the map API. For the logo, we used LogoMaker by ucraft.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all inexperienced with mobile app development, so becoming accustomed to Android Studio and writing in both XML and Java was difficult in the beginning. Also, figuring out how to use MapBox and store data even after closing the app was particularly difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of completing a functional app that is aesthetically pleasing and somewhat useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop an Android app and collaborate with teammates by equally dividing the tasks and helping one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Frood
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our free time, we may like to learn how to authorize users, handle user input mistakes, and develop Frood for iOS.
