                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pill counters are a rarity in pharmacies because of how expensive they are. We came up the idea with using augmented reality to speed and and increase the quality and efficiency of pharmacist that work in retail that have to fill prescriptions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a picture of what the pharmacists is looking at (pills) and it identifies them and counts the amount of pills on the table.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Microsoft's Hololens integrating it with custom vision. We trained a program with over 400 pictures that we took and labeled them manually respectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very challenging to write a function that takes the live pictures and then send the image to Microsoft API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learend how to train a machine learning algorithm and how to create an app for Hololens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Count On Us
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now we are only logging the number on the console in the future we would like to display it on the screen of the Hololens.
Make the user experience better, add more pills to our databases and increase our algorithm accuracy. We also want tp be able to show live the pharmacist the amount of pills.
