                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to provide a way for people to feel safe while they're traveling in unfamiliar territory, we decided to create an app that allows citizens to report a crime that they have seen to the police and see crime that other people have reported.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StreetSmart stores the information that users report in a database, which police can utilize. Each report also shows up as a pin on the app. As crime reports grow over time, other users will be able to use this information so that they know which area to avoid when they're in an unfamiliar place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift and Xcode to build the app, and we used MySQL to create the backend database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unfamiliar with MySQL. We had trouble saving the data we collect from our app on Xcode to the database we made as well as trying to use the information on the database from the app.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we learned how to use MySQL and created a database.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about databases and connecting them to apps.

                <p>
                    We will try to connect the database to the app.
