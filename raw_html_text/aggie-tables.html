                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have all personally been annoyed by getting our food at one of the dining halls and trying to find a seat for so long that our food gets cold.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A  button would be at each dining table and this button will be green for open, yellow for semi-open, and red for full. The page will then show in real time which tables are open based on their buttons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used C++, a ti-launchpad, and a breadboard to create a button that would be at each dining table.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    transferring our code from Python into HTML and reading data from button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    learning html, flask, and to read data from button into computer.
                </p>
