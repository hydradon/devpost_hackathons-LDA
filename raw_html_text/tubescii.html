                    At the beginning of sunhack we were stumped. Although we're sophomores we still felt like a lot of things were out of scope for us. Thinking of an idea that was interesting, let alone plausible, in 36 hours was a difficult feat. Our first night felt like a lot of ideas that never even made it to step one of being implemented, and we spent the whole time looking up APIs trying to see what was available to us.

                    We came to the conclusion that anything of any real use was a little out of our reach, so we picked another secondary goal instead.

                    TubeSCII was a fun idea in concept: a video player that played videos in ASCII art. We tossed that idea around and added bits of details before we sat down and decided to learn Javascript just to achieve this idea. In just a little over 8 hours we had a small webserver running that could play videos thanks to the help of one of our more prodigious teammates, Wyatt. Each little hurdle and feat we overcame felt like a big achievement in our coding knowledge. We feel like we've explored new areas of coding we could hardly think of tackling on our own. This weekend was a real success for us seeing our work come to fruition, and we're glad to have come to sunhacks.
