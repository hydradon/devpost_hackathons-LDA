                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a child who grew up in a lower-income bracket, I did not have as many opportunities to eat healthy as a child should, and it caused many physiological changes. Now that I am older, I have a chance to improve the lives of others, especially the children, who are struggling with this issue as well.
