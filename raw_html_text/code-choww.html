                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game that would introduce children to programming. We reminisced about our time in middle school and wished we had been introduced to coding at a younger age. We believe one way to achieve diversity in  the workplace is by exposing under represented communities to the power of computer science.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Code Poww was initially a game that children could play to learn how to code. The only way to gain points is by making function calls such as characterName.jump or characterName.jump. These calls will give children a basic understanding of object oriented programming. Our website currently demos what this game will do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this hackathon we focused on creating a demo for this game and a display page for how the game would work. The display page was built using html and css. The demo was built using photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially tried to build the game  using the phaser api. One team mate had experience developing games in Java but we wanted to develop a javascript based game. We got stuck adding the image to the screen. After this was solved we had a hard time conceptualizing how the students code would get checked and how to proceed once this was done. We also had trouble connecting our site with our domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a working demo, so thats great!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about sprites and phaser.

                    What's next for Code Poww
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next steps would be to actually create the game.
