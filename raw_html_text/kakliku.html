                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program allows user to take a picture of , what is supposed to be an image text, and transforms it into an editable and searchable text. It currently recognizes over than 600 languages, but in this version, we are only using 2 - English and Georgian.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using an enormous and difficult library called tesseract along with leptonica within an android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This library had no support for Georgian language and we had to implement it into it ourselves. This part took the most time of our Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IT WORKS! (with over 95 % accuracy of course)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about android and ndk, which enabled us to use c++ code. We also learned that there is a library which needs 30 minutes to compile...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kakliku
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kakliku won't be forgotten, There lies a great path of development in front of it. More functionalities, more languages, real time support.. etc.
