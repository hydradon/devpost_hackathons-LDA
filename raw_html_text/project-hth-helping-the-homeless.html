                <p>
                    We built it by integrating the Google Maps API software and also HTML, Javascript, CSS, etc.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into involved lack of knowledge regarding certain aspects of the project, making it so we had to learn as we went along.

                <p>
                    We're proud of finishing this website and successfully implementing the resources we set out to, it was long and tedious but we gained a lot of knowledge and experience along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program in teams, split up tasks, and learned more about the topic of homelessness in general through our research.

                    What's next for Project HTH (Helping the Homeless)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on expanding our website and also developing an app which could utilize a mesh network to transfer data from one homeless individual to another, creating a larger web of communication and information transfer.
