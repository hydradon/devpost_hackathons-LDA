                    Our goal is to provide accurate, reliable information about the scope and depth of disasters that have affected different locations. Therefore, organizations such as the Red Cross and other disaster relief efforts know which areas have been deeply affected by different natural disasters and where they can and should focus their efforts. We have three different categories of information that we provide- which regions do not have food/water, which roads or no longer functional, and which regions do not have network. You can choose to display all of these or toggle them until you have the display you would like. Even though some disasters are inevitable, we think it is vital to have an efficient process for providing relief and paving the path for recovery so affected communities can rebuild themselves.

                <h2>
                    We learned a lot about web development using React and Bulma. We also learned how hackathons work and how we as a team can work on a short-term, but impactful project.

                    We faced a lot of challenges using different services and trying to deploy our application. However, we worked together and overcame these challenges, learning from them in the process.
