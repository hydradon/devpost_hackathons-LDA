                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Number game that I played when i was young inspired me to make this program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First it let you guess number 1 to 31. After you guess, if it is not correct the computer set, it will say larger or less than your number. You can guess easier every time you guess. How many times you guess will show up at the last(when you get correct number). Play with friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it

                    Using Random, while loop.

                <p>
                    I did not know how to use Random Number code.
