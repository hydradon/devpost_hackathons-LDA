                    The energy industry is monopolized by large corporations who bring tremendous fees for usage of power and answer to no one. They have more power than the government and citizens in small communities have to pay more due to the cost associated with transporting power from large installations and the energy lost in doing so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    dEnergy is a platform for energy trading for smaller companies or even individuals to trade power via the ethereum blockchain. The platform uses ether as a mode of exchange to eliminate fraud and ensure one isn't being taxed any more than needed.

                    I set up my own private ethereum testnet and used the web3js API to import a smart contract into a simple html file. From there I used jquery and html5 functions to execute commands from within the contract and retreive certain values as needed for the end user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first, i had no method of returning the value of variables within the contract so I used solidity events to replace the html of a textarea and return the value as needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using web3js, I was able to successfully trade ether on my private testnet via different firebase accounts
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned the first method of doing a given thing isn't always the right one, and one should be open to trying different methods of executing their code as I did when I spent a considerable fraction of the day trying different methods to send ether
Actually installing the plants and getting the site live on the ethereum mainnet so it can be used for real trading rather than simply between two different acsounts at a time
