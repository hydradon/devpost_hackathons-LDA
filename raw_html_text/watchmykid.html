                <p>
                    We also had some troubles to get a domain from domain.com, so we ended up hosting our static web page on Github Pages.

                    We have created a project that can help parents to keep their kids save from the internet content. They will be notified with the potential dangerous URL of the page that the kids are visiting.

                    We have learned to create a Chrome extension with react and use Azure Cognitive Services to classify images depending on their content.
