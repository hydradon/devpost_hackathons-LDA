                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Listening to music and appreciating and noticing how few artists used weird/experimental synthesizers, and that when artists did, they ended up being an interesting or vital part of a track (when done right).
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A laptop webcam tracks the tip of your index finger, and gets your x and y coordinate. Based on your fingers relative position to the edge of the camera frame, the "intensity" of a few effects on some standard synthesizers which are up to the user to choose from (varying form distortion to reverb) change. The user can set up to two effects, one being controlled by the relative position in the x and one in the y. There is also functionality to play with your synth with a keyboard.
