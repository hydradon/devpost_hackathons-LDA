                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As minorities and women of color in the tech industry, we were inspired by the idea of bringing like-minded individuals together through a single platform. Our idea stemmed from personal experiences, from once being mentees, to now being mentors to other young women in technology.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    LightHER is dedicated to matching women with mentees and mentors in STEM. Our team of developers' goal is to build a community through an interactive interface that will allow mentees and mentors to filter matches based on interests, location, age, and goals.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am not too well versed with using Git and the command line and struggled to understand the commands at first, until finally growing comfortable with it enough to be able to utilize it with the rest of my team.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While the website is not 100% complete, I'm incredibly proud of the message behind it and what we are trying to share with women in tech who may not have the confidence to get out there to meet with other industry professionals who are just like them. This website is to let women know that they are not alone!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to get a better understanding of utilizing Git and the command line as well as got a little more experience using Bootstrap, which I typically don't use when building websites as I prefer starting from scratch.

                    What's next for LightHER
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LightHER is a project that I want to keep working on after Technica ends. Uniting women in technology is a long term goal of mine and is a very personal one, especially because of the fact that I am on the e-board of an on-campus organization in New York dedicated to doing this everyday.
