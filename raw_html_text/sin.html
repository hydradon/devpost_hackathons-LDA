                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When complete, it allows professors to share documentation with students. The students should be able to see all their courses and which paperwork they have for each one
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using xcode and swift. We connected the app to an online database, allowing paperwork to be viewed by different devices
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Impossible to work with docusign API. It was also challenging to understand how to create an online database to hold the data and connect to the app. Because it was every team member's first hackathon, we also had trouble finding way to share code with each other and work independently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sending and retrieving to/form database. Making the tableview of our app look nice. UI does not show aparant errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with firebase, xcode, and swift. We also learned that, in the future, it would be bette to start with a small project and build on it, rather than attempting a challenging project right away.

                    What's next for Sine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a way to make docusign API work, or find another API that allows for the same functionalities. Finish the platform so the app can reach a usable state
