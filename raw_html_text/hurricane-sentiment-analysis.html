                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some fantastic ideas that nobody on our team new how to accomplish so we went with something that we had at least a little experience in.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    At the home page there are two options, one is to click a button to donate to Red Cross and takes you to their donation website. The other one takes you to a page with the map of the world and in it are circles that represent a tweet with a keyword of Hurricane in it. Each circle is a certain color based on what their reaction was. The four main colors are Red for mad/distressed emotions, Green for happy/optimistic emotions, Yellow for a mixed combination of emotions, and White representing a tweet that had no real emotion connected to it. Based on these graphics, one can infer different situations with emotions and begin to understand what exactly is happening.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to parse in the text,  some of the giant json files given to us. We then

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge that we ran into was implementing the Domain.com domain with Amazon Web Service. This took about 8 hours to figure out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another Challenge we faced was on using actually creating the website in a timely manner. Google made it fairly easy to implement a map with circles on it so that was a plus.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we are capable of coming up with ideas but we need to focus more on practical applications.
