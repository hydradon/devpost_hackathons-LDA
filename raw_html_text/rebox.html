                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Death of a close one forced us to examine the ease of use with transferring physical property vs rigidity of current email-as-identity based system.  In today's world it is possible to keep ones identity while changing his/her address.  Not as simple in the digital world where your address IS your identity.  This needed to be addressed to release the value latent within vanity email addresses and other usernames/avatars/labels available through provider-specific social platforms (facebook, google+, snapchat, instagram, pinterest, etc.).  Identity is permanent, address is flexible
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Introduces a global ID registry service that provider services can reference, and users can sign up for.  Adopters are afforded the ability to barter and trade registry assets between themselves. Once fully adopted, service providers will provide the rules of engagement as needed to properly route messages between users based on asset ownership as indicated in the registry.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created an instance of Hyperledger Fabric v1.  Built a model on Hyperledger Playground online.  Downloaded Hyperledger Playground to local ubuntu box.  Connected  local composer playground to HLFV1 instance on Bluemix.  Ran commands to stand up RESTful API.  Built light-weight JQuery based front end - invoking RESTful api to drive registration and market listing actions

                    <li>
                        Complex Documentation.  No easy path between IBM and Hyperledger docs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ubuntu environment crash 1hr before leaving the first day
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Due to environment rebuild lost critical time to further develop pitch and build more compelling front end
                    </li>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't get to the 100% vision we shared.  But the 70% correctly show-cased use of all components and we did a great job speaking to the concept of an open marketplace for digital assets that adorn our identities without becoming our identities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hyperledger Composer is a great tool for mocking up smart contracts without worrying about the complexities of the underlying Fabric or blockchain implementation.  The models are SUPER EASY to set up and are exactly what the enterprise needs to become efficient on DLT in no time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For more complex implementations that require cross channel communication, we would recommend building chaincode directly on top of the Fabric.  Great to have different tools to work with based on the complexity.  Modularity and separation of concerns was also a great feature for the enterprise.
                </p>

                    What's next for reBox
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both members will continue to market the experience over social media outlets.  Melvin will join the DID Working Group and Hyperledger Indy team to focus on outreach.  Team is looking forward to pairing this concept with blockstack Client to showcase how the marketplace can work.  Would like to attend more Hackathons to flush the idea out more.
