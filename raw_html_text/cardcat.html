                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having gone to many conferences in the past, I've ended up with a stack of business cards that lay unused due to the high time cost of going through them.  My goal with CardCat was to lower that cost, making networking easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in a image via a MMS message, parses text &amp; scans for contact info in that text, then returns a VCard of that contact information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire workflow is in python, at first it was run locally via a Flask server, then once I had a reasonably stable version I migrated to Google Cloud functions to allow for lower latency &amp; easier scaling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Windows. Line. Endings.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating and shipping this project all in one day, I was skeptical I would finish at first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using APIs is an amazing way to get a lot done in a little time, why solve a problem twice?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CardCat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be great to integrate it into a mobile application that allows people to correct errors that the parser made, and storing these corrections to improve predictions in the future.
                </p>

                    Try it out (It's not a url, so I can't put this below)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Text a picture of a business card to (609) 785-3037 &amp; it will reply with a VCard. (Note: it can take up to a minute to reply)
