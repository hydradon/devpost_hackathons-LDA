                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a website like GreatSchools that would enable the user to assess whether a neighborhood is a nice place to live or not. Currently, it's easy to obtain info on the features inside the house, but not the most important feature: the location! Our website solves this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Input a ZIP code and get results on various statistics of the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML, Python, and JavaScript in combination with the Domain.com website builder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating all the different components into a cohesive unit. There was also hundreds of thousands of data points, which made things difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to solve these challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration of different languages and building a website from scratch.
                </p>

                    What's next for Sherlock Homes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more time and resources, we could add much more data to our analysis, giving a fuller picture of the neighborhood.
