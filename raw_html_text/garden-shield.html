                    Inspiration - We surveyed teachers in our school, to list out problems they faced in everyday life. Our engineering teacher said he had a garden and animals ate his fruits. This inspired us to make pest repeller.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - It tries to keep away pests by scaring them away with flashing lights, sounds, and movement. The shape of the coyote is said to deter most herbivores.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - We cut the cardboard, and slowly attached the sensors and wired it all together.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - Interfacing two Arduino, Making it all work together.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - The finished product looks presentable.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - How to use PIR sensors. Most LEDs won't work in series circuits.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Garden Shield - Try and make it look pleasing and increase functionality.
