                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When queuing for competitive overwatch it can become frustrating not having a team. Since solo queuing is a great way to get stuck in SR hell; we decided to make a bot that can group people with similar skill levels together so they can have a team to coordinate with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It groups members of a server into teams based on their skill rankings and most played roles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript and an overwatch api to get player data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally tried to use a different api to retrieve player data but it was not properly documented and was hard to query.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The difference between a javascript object and a javascript object literal.
                </p>

                    What's next for Overwatch Dream Team
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hopefully aim to add more advanced metrics to gauge skill.
