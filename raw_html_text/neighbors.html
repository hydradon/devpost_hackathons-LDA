                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our busy lives have modified our view of &ldquo;tasks&rdquo;
-It has become difficult for people to allocate time to do the simplest of tasks such as mowing the lawn, buying groceries etc
-Jobs like handyman, plumbers that were once devalued are now rising in value
-60% of the world population still does not have access to Internet service. As a result, they are deprived of the various benefits that comes with the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neighbors is a android based app that connects people with internet connections who have job offer to people who are qualified for the job (regardless of whether they have access to internet or not).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to create our app. 
Nexmo's API, a Vonage company, was used to send job offers in the form of text message to qualified people and to get their response. This response was recorded and displayed in the profile of the user who posted the advertisement for the job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team members had any experience with FireBase and this was our first time using Nexmo's API. Coming up with an idea that had real world application was a real challenge. Apart from that we had some other challenges related to coding that were solved by watching youtube video or referring to company representatives in PennApps XIV.
