                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have seen in the past that people try to alter student information such as test scores and grades for college admission and we have also noticed the difficulty within obtaining student information with individuals usually having to go to multiple sources so we wanted to create an application that solves both of these problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    U.N.I allows individuals to research accurate information on students such as their bio and transcripts in a safe and secure manor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built it using solidity and javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges i ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was pretty challenging to come up with a plausible and realistic idea to execute. It was also a challenge to write the code for the application considering that none of the member of our team had ever worked with the coding language solidity.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That teamwork real does put everything together and that you have to be ready to step in when there is no other choice.

                    To reach out to schools so that they can test the system and give us feedback. Also to have a meeting with the minister of education.
