                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learners need targeted and comprehensive help when struggling with a topic/tool.

                <p>
                    iTut connects learners who have a question about a certain topic with other community members knowledgeable in this topic (Tutors) to have an online one on one video call. Community members have a personal rating based on previous help offered or video calls that received high rating.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django to create the backend server with Firebase for storing users and questions details. We used Node.js for creating video calls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for iTut
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iTut isn't completely finished, so there is still work to be done in building a friendly and encouraging platform for members to share knowledge and offer help to each other.
