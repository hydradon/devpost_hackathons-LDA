                    Inspiration: Working in technical support, and with the upcoming integration of Direct to Express utilizing TriPOS configurations, we will be seeing more configuration files and we would like to expedite troubleshooting and create an external tool that can be utilized by those outside of Vantiv Integrated Payments.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: This tool allows easy modification and validation of configuration parameters. It imports, exports, and validates the file.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: Html, javascript/Typescript, and XML.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Validation errors, and exporting (still in the works!)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Getting the tool to export right before the deadline, even though it doesn't save any of the fields into the exported file.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: JavaScript is difficult to work with, planning, and that it's okay to put some portions of your idea on the backburner!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for triPOS Config Tool: Exporting fields to the external file, and added services:
