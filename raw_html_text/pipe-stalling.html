                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us had nostalgia for doing a game similar to the first game that we created together. However, we decided to completely revamp the physics, graphics, and ideology to make a better and more fun product. We even made it have 4 players. Title and character names were inspired by our Computer Architecture class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Controls
                    </strong>
                    Movement keys are [WASD], [IJKL], [TFGH], [UP, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT]. Beam attack keys are E, O, Y, and RIGHT_SHIFT. Special attacks exclusive to each character are Q, R, U, FORWARD_SLASH. Pressing the down key in the air results in a faster slam attack which deals damage. Double tapping left or right keys initiates a faster dash. All attacks besides slamming deal recoil. Health is tracked out of 100 points, and only one character can heal health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        The Characters
                    </strong>
                    Bulbastore (STORE) - Green character. Special attack stores energy and then releases it in a strong blast.
Loadstar (LOAD) - Yellow character. Special attack loads mines into the world, which explode when another player makes contact.
Jumpernaut (JUMP) - Blue character. Special attack initiates a super jump. Slamming during this jump creates 3 times the impact.
Mad Adder (ADD) - Red character. Special attack damages enemy with beam and adds their health to own health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        How to Win
                    </strong>
                    Fight to the death free for all, last one standing wins. Those who lose all of their health are losers. SAD!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply put, this game is fun for the whole family.
