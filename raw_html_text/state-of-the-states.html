                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Surprised about election results? So were we.
This election brought to light vast disparities in different parts of America. With uneven development occurring across the country, we have lost touch with what "other" parts of America are like. State of the States aims to show you what your life would be like if you grew up elsewhere. How would your income change? Access to women's healthcare? What about pregnancy rates? We aim to build empathy across the partisan divide, while providing links to charities where our users can donate to causes they learn about through us.

                    Pacing ourselves at our first Hackathon, learning Flask and its intricacies, cleaning large amounts of data quickly, managing a team that could play to our strengths given that half of us have only taken a single intro CS course.
