                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Amazon web services such as Lambda along with Alexa skill kit to build this skill. I really enjoyed building it. This is my fourth live skill on Amazon skill store.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to maintain session state to record which question has user answered as Yes and which one as No. I thought I have to use DynamoDB to store the information but I didn't want to do that as I really don't need that info later. Then I figured out how to use Session attributes and it really solved my problem.
