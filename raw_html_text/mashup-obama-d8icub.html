                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all seen those videos of Obama singing 'Panda' or 'Call Me Maybe' on youtube. We wanted to make it possible for the general user to make those.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application takes in a string of text that you'd like Obama to say, and we generate a video of Obama saying it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Watson API for speech to text processing and parsed Obama speeches into a database of words that Obama has said. After running many videos through our database generation process, we develop a map from words to video slices. We then splice together the videos that the user wants based on the words he or she requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some errors serving a video to a webpage efficiently, so we pivoted and made our application a desktop program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to make fun videos of Obama.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to interact with IBM bluemix and how to use the Watson API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mashup Obama
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to scale up our database to something much larger, so that we have a larger set of words to choose from and also multiple people we can make mashups from.
