                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Landmarks; what distinguish one city from another, tourism attractions and it creates the identity for the place. Creating smart animated LED landmark that can be customized based on a certain event is what we want to see next in Saudi Arabia as we are heading to achieve the vision 2030.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Epoxy Lens can serve both the government and private sectors. It can collaborate with international and national events so that on a national day, for example, it would present customized animated light that can represent the event. It also can present the advertisement for organization product or service in a unique 3D Led design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware prototype: It was built using Arduino UNO, 64 LEDs, a breadboard, 16 (220 ohms) + (1k ohm) resistor to protect the LEDs and 4 transistors for digital switching. 16 LED was bent and soldiered to fulfill the condition of cathodes connected together forming a layer and anodes vertically as columns (in this step we would have 1 layer and 16 columns).  We repeat this step 4 times, that will create for us 4 layers. The last step for the hardware would be soldiering all the columns together.  So we ended up with 16 anodes (columns) and 4 cathodes (layers).
Software: we used Arduino IDE for the main code and LED cube generator to ease visualizing the controlling of the cube (what to turn on and what to turn off from the LEDs). With that we created a pattern that displays &ldquo;2030&rdquo; on the LED cube, each number at a time (No.2&gt; delay&gt; No. 3&gt; delay and so on)  Also, we used Adobe Illustrator to design the front end web interfaces.

                        Label correctly and logically! That would come in handy in future. You&rsquo;re probably going to forget why did you plug that wire in that pin BUT with the correct logic you can always trace it back. P.s. we paid the price for learning this one :&rsquo;)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We&rsquo;ve always known &ldquo;voltage is the difference between two points&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve never used it efficiently in a practical situation. I know this &ldquo;if anode= 5v and cathode=0v led would light up&rdquo; I learned this &ldquo;so if we want to make sure to make the led off it&rsquo;s either anode=0v and cathode=0v &ndash;here it comes- OR anode=v and cathode=5v&rdquo;. That would defiantly help with controlling each led individually on different layers.

                    We want to bring the idea to life, Creating a designing website that is accessible by both experts and hobbies from different ages and different backgrounds. The website would generate the corresponding code of the designs without going throw the hassle of &ldquo;the line codes&rdquo;. We want to add the feature of animating your 3d designs. In addition, we may make the LED cube works by solar power cells to reduce the usage of electrical power.
