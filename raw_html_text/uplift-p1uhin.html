                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Especially in college, stress is a universally (haha get it?) experienced problem, and sometimes you just want to talk about it. We were actually initially inspired by "Tinder" for it's use as a matchmaking application, although we did not exactly take much design influence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program matches up stressed users with a personal counselor or a professional. The user simply answers a few questions and our program gives them a list of possible helpers to chat with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Github as a collaborative space so we were able to work simultaneously on the project. We used text editors like atom and sublime in order to program in the languages of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP and we used eclipse to program in Java. We started out with the front end by creating the HTML and CSS of the home page. We linked the next page and programmed the HTML and CSS for the next page. We made a form in which we stored the user input as variables for javaScript. We used the local data and our algorithm analyzed the database to find the top five options at most for the users. We then output the most compatible options on the page and provided an option to chat with these options by creating a chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a variety of issues regarding how we managed our back end. However, we found many shorter solutions that ultimately did not affect the user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a responsive website that takes user input that generates the appropriate list of outputs. The design is visually appealing and incorporates almost all the necessary components of a real application.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned the various aspects of website development.

                <p>
                    If we were to continue working on uplift in the future, we would work on having an organized messaging system.
