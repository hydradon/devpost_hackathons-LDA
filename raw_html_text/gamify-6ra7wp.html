                    The program starts with a dashboard in which the user may:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        import an existing text file with terms and definitions from File Explorer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        begin a new study set by adding terms and their corresponding definitions using purely UI
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        launch one of a wide selection of games using the selected study set
### Games
#### Match

#### Snake
A take on the classic video game that prompts the player to enter a term's definition when the snake collects food
#### Tetris
