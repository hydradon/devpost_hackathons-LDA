                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's currently a depression epidemic. About 20% of Americans today, in fact, suffer from depression. It's hard for them to get out there, feel connected and involved. And so, we created Got Plans? as a simple way for users with depression to find things to do.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Invites users to add more events if they don't have very many on their calendar, encouraging them to get out of their slump.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift 4, node.js, MongoDB, Alamofire, JTAppleCalendar
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, events we post to the API endpoint do not show up in the database. Also, Facebook's SDK is not easy to work with -- so we ditched it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The calendar and schedule views are dynamic, and update as you click around (without having to update the ViewController). Users can also successfully register and login, allowing us to store their events even after they've closed the app.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't use 3rd party APIs if you can help it!
