                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always have apps that cater towards protecting homes and tracking kids, but nothing that actually truly helps kids deal with high stress situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An app that enables kids to quietly message the police, their parents, and sound an alarm from a different location, with just three simple buttons. This idea branched into a location tracker and a guided breathing exercise with Alert Ninja.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app with Android Studio using an SMS API along with a LocationSending API. Wireframes were created on Figma.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the specific functions needed for each aspect of the app and debugging the SMS functions.
                </p>

                    The UI is very well thought out and kid friendly.
