                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use Discord a lot (which is another communication software platform, it's extremely similar to Slack). When I'm at home, in my second monitor, I always have Discord open. More specifically, my own personal Discord workspace (think about if you have your own Slack, where you were the only member in it). I use it to write little reminders for myself, links to refer to later, a list of reminders of things to do, I use it to transfer files between my PC which I can open on my laptop later, etc. - I wanted to make a bot that could improve "quality of life", if you will. Sort of like a personal assistant.

                    I wanted to make an "improving quality of life" bot, sort of like a personal assistant where you could @ the bot, give it a command, and it would execute it for you. The idea was I could get all of these done from the comfort of that text box, no need to open anything else. Some features / commands I wanted to implement were:
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You could @ the bot name and based on certain command keywords you could have the bot do different tasks, all from the comfort of that Discord text box; no need to open anything else. Some features / commands I wanted to implement were:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basic arithmetic
Example: @Allie_Bot calculate 2047 / 31
                </p>
                <p>
                    Set reminders
Example: @Allie_Bot remindme 20min take pizza out of oven (and then in 20 minutes, you would be pinged)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Add calendar events to Google Calander
Example: @Allie_Bot calendar Thursday September 20 2019 12:00-15:00 swimming lessons (and it would add this event to your calendar)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Post top 5 current hottest posts of a subreddit
Example: @Allie_Bot reddit r/memes (next 5 messages are links to the current top 5 hottest posts)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perform Google searches for you
Example: @Allie_Bot search apples (returns a link to the first link you would normally get if you were to type apples into a search engine)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built in Java, using the Java Discord API (JDA).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think I bit off way more than I can chew. I was familiar with the Java Discord API, but trying to learn how to use the Reddit API, the Google Calendar API, the DuckDuckGo API, was extremely overwhelming. I wasn't able to implement a lot of my planned features.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got my bot up and running. It can do basic arithmetic and can do "true randomness" tasks - such as coinflips and dice rolls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned I just need to work harder for the things I want to achieve. Can't go into Hack the North 2019 being satisfied with what I already know - I need to plan much better in advance so I can do better in my future events.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Get all my planned features to work. Then add more, and to never settle for mediocrity. Even the most minor task such as finding out the contents of a certain cell in a certain Google Sheet, I want to be able to retrieve it.
