                    What is our goal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is focused on assisting the Continuum Of Care services with a simple yet robust design. Additionally, we want to make our platform as accessible as possible to a wide variety of users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    INN satisfies three primary goals:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Its primary function is to
                        <strong>
                            help the homeless get off the street as quickly as possible
                        </strong>
                        . It does this by providing anyone with access to the internet with the availability of local shelters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shelter workers can use this technology to
                        <strong>
                            redirect homeless to shelters with more resources
                        </strong>
                        . If homeless people do not have access to the internet they can call a shelter who, by using our platform, can then direct them to the nearest available C.O.C facility.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide a platform by which users may
                        <strong>
                            quickly visualize nearby shelter occupancy levels
                        </strong>
                        .
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    INN was developed using JSP and java servlets. The high level design leans toward a model view controller approach. We used a mysql database to store all of our client and shelter information. The server accesses this data and gives it to the user in a variety of formats. We used Google Maps API to display shelters and calculate relative distances. Finally, the front end design is primarily based on and implements Google's Material Design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge our team faced was overcoming the organizational complexities of developing purposeful software in a small amount of time. we also faced a few technical issues such as software compatibility and version control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we maintained challenging yet achievable goals throughout development of INN. Additionally, we take pride in the teamwork and collaborative skills that were developed along to way. Most importantly, our team is proud of developing software that we believe will help both the homeless community and the shelters that provide them service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned a great deal about the planning, and collaborative process. We learned how to communicate effectively as a group to teach each other new techniques and skills. This hackathon also opened our eyes to the severity of homelessness in our own communities. We learned that we have the power to make a change,
