                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make using a computer more accessible for people who may have trouble using a mouse and keyboard. To that end, we developed GoldenEye.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GoldenEye is an application which uses eye-tracking and blink detection to control mouse movements and clicking. We think that this is an important first step in the accessibility of technology for users who have difficulty operating a mouse, and we hope that this serves as a foundation for future developments in accessibility using eye-tracking. Eye-tracking is a promising technology with a generally negative reputation based on privacy concerns, but we hope that more people are beginning to see how it could serve as a helpful technology in many different use-cases.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our program with Python, using a tobii eye-tracker for input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Timing the blinks, accuracy of the clicks, and reducing input lag.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time we've worked with an accessibility and we're proud to release a product that enables and empowers users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that eye-tracking is a great technology that should not be overlooked because of its negative implications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GoldenEye
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a plan to create an eye-authenticated password manager, with authentication happening by tracing a pattern with your eyes. We were unable to roll this out in the time allotted tonight but hope to implement this functionality in the future.
