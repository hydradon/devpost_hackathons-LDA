                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An MSN icon that said "the problem with life is there isn't any background music"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Play music to suite your mood and activities. You tell the app what you like to listen to when you do various activities and give it your schedule. The app will pick songs to keep you in a good mood whether that means getting you pumped to do another lap around the track, or staying calm while you work on a stressful project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, parallelized work with Git, ate a lot of chips, and wrote some Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding how Android libraries work together, and we all needed a Java refresher.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked very well as a team. We were supportive of each other, we parallelized efficiently, and our skills complemented each others' well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Project scoping is very important. We were too ambitious and had to simplify the project as we went.
                </p>

                    Connecting with a wearable to more easily and conveniently measure heart rate.
