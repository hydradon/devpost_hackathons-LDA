                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We threw ideas at each other until we found something we all liked- something game-y but a bit different. We all also had an interest in android development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Step Quest keeps track of steps taken from when a phone is restarted and during the day. The number of steps then helped calculated calories burned and kilometers walked by the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with learning basic components of android development and moved into working with sensors in android phones. Later, we learned to design fragments for the application and added pixel art for the game-y feel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with the complex sensors as beginners to android was very difficult. We also had many issues with changing font, and sharing data between fragments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a working application and we all got some experience in android development!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a ton of experience working in android development and especially with fragments and sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Step Quest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Step Quest may become a full sized app that could be released on mobile stores. There's many features we would've liked to include, but we were short on knowledge and time. We would like to implement a character customization system, a leveling system, more achievements, more accurate calorie tracking, and many other features.
