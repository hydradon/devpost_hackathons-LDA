                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are 187,830 students in FCPS this year. Thousands of them need financial aid but don't have an easy and efficient way to do it. We wanted to create an easier way to give other kids a good education without having to worry about fees or any type of money needed for school events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A student can fill in questions and get recommendations from teachers to attract the attention of companies. These companies can grant them money for their education and contact students about career opportunities with them.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Code.org to create our app. Code.org uses block code to do commands and create the app, using JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a difficult time stringing all of our code together. In order to save time, we worked on different screens on our own time and decided we would compile them all together afterwards. When it came to actually putting them together, the code did not work properly. We talked to mentors and they didn't have a solution besides starting all over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of coming up with an idea that could help hundreds of thousands of people get an education without worrying about fees. We think this app could really be useful to many people and influence the world in many ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it is best to work on all the code on one computer/account. We would have saved a lot more time if we did that from the beginning but we wanted to split up the work evenly. We also became more comfortable with using Code.org
                </p>

                    What's next for SMOrES
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve our app and have our own way of processing money other than using other places like Apple Pay. We also want to improve our UI design and make it more friendly looking.
