                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a fun video game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's pretty much a clone of that mario party game, that's really it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    umm, sweat, tears, blood, unity, C#, and a lot of youtube tutorials
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apple's own proprietary IDE apparently doesn't like to work with Apples own proprietary graphics API, who knew? thanks for actually working, OpenGL!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting networking to work, kind of? It's still in progress, we'll see :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork makes the dream work. Also apple kind of sucks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BallBrawlers
                </h2>
                <p>
                    probably nothing, but maybe we'll put in microtransactions or something.
