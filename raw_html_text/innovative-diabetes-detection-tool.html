                    Try to detect Diabetes from everyday bathroom usage without urinal and blood sample. This application acquires the information from the sensor detecting the urine from the toilet. By doing so, it both acquire a lot of data necessary for the Diabetes detection and reduce the high cost and tedious process to do the same process in the hospital. I build the application on the XCode. This application can be operated on iPhone, which is fairly accessible for most Americans. I have learned so much in a day considering that I am quite new to the App development. Ultimately, it will be able to transfer the information from users' smartphone to doctors across the United States.
