                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really enjoy the benefit and comfort of couch gaming.  We also enjoyed VR content alot, and so we mixed them together and came up with a concept for a better control system in VR for more relaxed gaming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It demos a VR control concept that prevents motion sickness, saves cost by using wireless connection and mobile devices.  It also provides movement in 8 different directions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using unity and a wireless connection app between the phone and a laptop keyboard we were able to build a basic model to prove our concept.
                </p>
