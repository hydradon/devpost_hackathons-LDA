                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a very common feeling to be at a very large event (a convention, a festival, a university orientation) and be lost in the huge facility, with a pamphlet that has a map but isn't very helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website, Mesh, allows an organizer of a large event to enter each individual event to our website. Attendees can access a digital pamphlet that has an ordered schedule of events as well as a list of events happening within the next 30 minutes as well as a map with all the locations of those upcoming events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using HTML/CSS for the front end and JavaScript for back end. JavaScript code would take information entered in text fields (by the organizer) and store it appropriately for later use/display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not very experienced with JavaScript upon beginning this project, so there were constant challenges every step of the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are generally proud of the UI/logo as well as the overall idea for the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of new JavaScript features, including how to locally store information in browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mesh
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are lots of features we would have added to Mesh before submission had we been given ample time that would make it more user-friendly.
                </p>
