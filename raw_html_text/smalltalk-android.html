                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We analyzed the daily grind of a phone support worker, who gets asked again and again the same questions from customers, and we know that this is a very inefficient way of approaching the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SmallTalk offers assistance for a person who's looking for support from mobile carrier providers or moblie phone sellers, it reduces the requirements for human assistance and it can be available 24/7 via our app or can be implemented with facebook/twitter
SmallTalk is based on a self-learning algorithm, and the more he encounters a certain intent from a user, the more he knows how to better approach it next time. Also it could filter through long sections of comments like on facebook and see the most important intents from users, like "Is this phone still available" or "How can i subscribe to this deal"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The setting stone for this project is wit-ai, a self learning chatbot framework for translating the intents of the users in interpretable actions by the server. The front-end consists in a android application which follows latest architecture guidelines and technologies, and a modern design
The interfacing with the chatbot framework is done in a local python server which supports communication flows, the system being smart enough to understand a communication and past inputs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For some of us from backend, it was our first time using python and developing backend logic, for the frontend, we tried to comply to the latest architecture guidelines and material designs setting some high standards for this ammount of time, like implementing biometrinc validation, flowing animations and on the code side, use code injection, mvvm architecture and follow the solid principles
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The separation of concerns between the team members was awesome, and for a hackaton context the workflow was very smooth and structured. For some of us this was the first hackaton ever, and got the chance to put our skills to a challange, and we are proud that we can deliver a product concept after all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us approached backend, and really got to see what common problems occur in this domain, the beauty of it and it's difficult parts. Communication and workflow skills got a good bump forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SmallTalk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backbone of the app, Wit-ai is built by facebook, and with some elbow grease it can be smoothly integrated into facebook messenger or twitter to offer support on such an accessible platform
                </p>
