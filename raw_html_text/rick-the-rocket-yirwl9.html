                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our primary inspiration was Snake Pass. The core idea behind Snake Pass was to break the conventional rules of a platformer that were previously thought to be required. Traditionally, a platformer needs two key aspects: running and jumping. Snake Pass is a platformer where jumping does not exist and all the following consequences. Similarly, Rick the Rocket is a game about exploring the consequences of a platformer where you can't run

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rick the Rocket challenges players to think outside the box for traditional movement options and asks them to keep track of their speed and directionality to explore mini-levels
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rick the Rocket was designed with the Pygame library for Python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Complicated collision mechanics with certain areas of sprites severely limited our progress, and made it impossible at times to move on with further steps, which ultimately led to cut features
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The thing we're most proud of is the player's movement. Controlling Rick is fairly intuitive and easy to learn, but hard and rewarding to master with a high skill ceiling. Once comfortable with the controls and with enough environmental power-ups, a player can truly feel like they're flying across a level
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest lesson we took from the development of Rick the Rocket was about time management. Specifically, we learned just how important it was to focus on core mechanics and physics right off the bat, no matter how difficult, otherwise the progress deficit can begin to snowball
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rick the Rocket
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main focus moving forward for Rick the Rocket is an issue of polish. Animations need to smoothed out, level interactions need to be cleaner, and most importantly: core mechanics such as the bouncing helmet, different powerups, and speed management need to be thoroughly explored through more plentiful and complex puzzles
