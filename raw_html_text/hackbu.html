                    What if you didn't know what to get for your friend on their birthday?

                    </strong>
                    Provides you with a birthday gift suggestion for your friend!

                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Alexa receives the name of the person you want to find a gift for.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Utilizes the Facebook Graph API to retrieve interests and likes associated with that person's online presence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Parses the info from Facebook to provide viable data that can then be used to construct keyword phrases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Calls the eBay Finding API with our generated phrases in a manner designed to retrieve the most relevant results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Parses the returned item and price info into a more conversational form, which Alexa then articulates to you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The item info and price is also sent to the Alexa companion app on your smartphone.

                    <li>
                        Add knowledge of a friend's birthday, ideally so the user could ask something like, "What friends have birthdays next week, and what should I get them?"

                                This was a stretch goal for us, and due to time constraints, we were unable to accomplish this during HackBU.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We came into HackBU having absolutely no experience with Alexa skills or any of the APIs we ended up using.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our first challenge was coming up with what technologies could help us reach this project's end goal. We initially went down the wrong path, diving heavily into Google's Content API for Shopping. It was only several hours into this research that we discovered that Google no longer provided public endpoints for this API and our time had been wasted researching it. The other initial obvious choice was using Amazon's own shopping API to return sales listings, but we found out that required prior registration and approval from Amazon, so that was unfeasable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We ended up choosing eBay's Finding API, as that appeared to be the most viable option, despite its API's lack of clear documentation, which ended up taking quite of experimentation to figure out.
