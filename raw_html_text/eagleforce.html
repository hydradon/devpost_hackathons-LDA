                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The problem statement was inspiring and challenging. It was great to see that with the available technology what we could do to detect oil spills which would otherwise be not possible at all.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With machine learning we can detect oil spill from the images provided and generate awareness and possibly detect the responsible party.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use AWS services (Serverless architecture - lambda, S3, Dynamodb, API Gateway) for developing our solution.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not use pre-trained model for inference.
