                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Procurement Docusign was inspired by necessity.  My company recently contacted Docusign about automating the signing of our company's purchase orders.  Due to the volume of purchase orders we process, we quickly realized that we would need something to reduce the amount of manual interaction our procurement department would have with the Docusign web interface.  Our current accounting/purchasing business application supports API integration, as does out SharePoint environment, which stores the signed documents.
