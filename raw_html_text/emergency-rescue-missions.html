                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is difficult for rescuers to go out into the field with very little training and go through rescue simulations, or rescue others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This prepares rescuers about violent situations, and informs them about what they should be doing in dangerous situations because they are experiencing the situation through simulations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally built it through Unity, then connected it to Steam VR, then we finished it by connecting it to the Oculus system and VR headset.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Unity took 12 hours and three tries to download onto the PC.  This was frustrating because the VR system only connects to the PC

                        Steam overpowered oculus instead of working with it.  The two programs didn't cooperate.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we created three simulations in Unity that turned out better than we could have ever imagined after starting out with no knowledge of what Unity was, how to use it, or how to connect it to the headset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work with Unity and VR software. We also learned that nothing is too hard to learn and make within 36 hours. Even though we had zero knowledge on working with these software, we managed to learn how to work with it in the future and create a potentially impactful simulation for rescue teams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emergency Rescue Missions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal for the next simulations to come will be more realistic and have more interactions with the environment, objects, and people so the teams will be able to have more experience and rescue survivors at a faster pace.
