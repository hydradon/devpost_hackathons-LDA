                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Access. Quality. Treatment costs. All healthcare systems must continuously make trade-offs between these three factors to strike a balance that caters to the majority&ndash; their attempt at a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; solution. But constituents are often unsatisfied with the generalized solution that&rsquo;s available where they live and would instead prefer that of a different region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A resident of New Zealand who is in need of surgery waits an average of 304 days but only has to pay a fraction of the cost of what it would be in the US. This is the result of the country&rsquo;s choice to sacrifice accessibility for reduced costs. To circumvent this confine, the patient must look to foreign alternatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, navigating the international medical landscape is a daunting task, for which there are currently no effective solutions. To this end, we propose DHEA, a platform that provides access to a global network of hospitals that was previously out of reach to the typical consumer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a target procedure or specialty, our application will present users with an intuitive overview of medical destinations, that is complete with a breakdown of wait time, quality, and travel + treatment costs for the top medical facilities within each country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each healthcare system has its own merits. We&rsquo;re not trying to get the best of all worlds. But what we are doing is giving the user the power to choose what to sacrifice and prioritize instead of . We&rsquo;re giving you a buffet of healthcare systems--you&rsquo;re not served one course the whole time, you get to choose. And what we&rsquo;re trying to do is create a system where the user gets to choose what to sacrifice and what to prioritize.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DHEA&rsquo;s novelty lies in its end-to-end, self-service, and personalized delivery. With our product, we empower patients to find their own optimal balance of access, quality of care, and affordability. With DHEA, we hope to move further towards the democratization of healthcare.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django as the web framework with HTML/CSS/JavaScript in the front-end and PostgreSQL in the back. To congregate travel information, we used the Amadeus API along with a simple cost-optimization algorithm. Additionally, we used python to write scripts for database seeding and web scraping.
