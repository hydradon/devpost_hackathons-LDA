                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the many people who want to shop online, but are afraid to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to enter their birth month, and then determines their birthstone. Then, it provides a link for them to buy birthstone jewelry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Android Studio and Java.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app initially wouldn't run. Then, the text was overlapping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I made an app! Also, I got the text to not overlap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use andriod studio.
                </p>

                    The app will remain forever in my memory.
