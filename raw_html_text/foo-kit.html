                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Inspiration for building this app came from the problem we are trying to fight: the absolute lack of "spiciness" in our lives. We wanted to develop an app that would help our users plan their next adventure
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Foo-Kit will plan an entire vacation for you; with a twist. You will not have any control on how the vacation is planned, but you will, however, be able to purchase a package built by our application- all with one easy click of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we wanted to start fresh. Include 2 APIs to gather the info we need and that's it: Pretty UI, good enough info. We eventually realized that was not enough. We discovered a wide variation of functionality that we could implement to the app. So we decided to integrate Twilio, to develop the user's personal tour guide during their spontaneous adventure.  The next idea was to gather health and safety information in the current state of the country. To do this, we used an RSS feed from the CDC website to gather any news on
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of us, it was our either our first time hacking or not enough experience hacking. We ran into a lot of bugs, errors, late night frustrations, and most importantly the lack of sleep. The technologies we wanted to integrate into the app were completely new to many of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to have a somewhat completed product is always something to be proud of. For the people in the team that learned new technologies over the past 36 hours, it was a great experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's never too late to learn something new. One of the most rewarding experiences was being able to learn the new APIs and integrate them. For others, it was being able to network with so many big tech companies and being given feedback on the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Foo-Kit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, the app will not be forgotten. Foo-kit has potential; whether in its current state or in a whole new iteration. We want to see Foo-Kit expand and be capable of handling users daily.
