                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was trying to build a learning platform based around teaching people with developmental auditory processing disorder reading a spelling. The first attempt was made using a SQL database.
                    <br>
                    The SQL database would not allow for complexity sounds letters mapping within the English language. I started to research different NoSQL database that could handle the complexity. Neo4j fit just right, so I began learning it. 
After working out the data structure, I started looking for a web developer that could make the website. I could not find any that were willing to work with the Neo4j in building a website, because for the lack of resources to learn.
                    <br>
                    So I started to learn; Neo4j with Python, Neo4j with Nodejs express, and GRANDstack. I liked GRANDstack the best.
I found a programmer to work with and showed him what I learned and the resources available and the problems for each.  We decided to Neo4j with Python, because there seemed to be more info out there to help and it was close to what he knows. We worked on this for six months before shutting it down. 
After that, I was determined to learn GRANDstack.  With a lot of struggle, I learned how to make a website with GRANDstack. I fell in love with technology and want to make it easier for others to learn.
                    <br>
                    I have wanted to make the site for a while now; the Global GraphHack pushed me to do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It teaches people how to create React components using Neo4j, GraphQL, and Apollo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the website with React with SCSS.  The stater and components on GitHub or made with GRANDstack starter, GraphQL, React, Apollo, and Neo4j.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not know any programming when I started not even HTLM or CSS when I started this project. 
I could not understand any of William Lyon code or Docs when I started when I started to learn. 
I still can not host the GRANDstack site.

                    I made a website using GRANDstack. It was my first website.
