                    <strong>
                        Classical computers
                    </strong>
                    have fundamental computational limits:
                    <em>
                        transistor scaling
                    </em>
                    puts physical and economic limits on our ability to make better processors,
                    <em>
                        parallelization constraints
                    </em>
                    limit our ability to use more processors, and
                    <em>
                        energy consumption
                    </em>
                    limits our ability to build denser architectures. Yet there is still so much more we'd like to do computationally. Problems like simulation-driven drug design, organic batteries and solar cell design, and the quest for AGI are all currently computationally expensive due to size and complexity.

                <p>
                    Formulating these problems in a way that leverages
                    <strong>
                        quantum computing
                    </strong>
                    could make them exponentially less costly. Quantum computers use qubits instead of bits, and when the qubits are put into a quantum-mechanical state, they can exist in a probabilistic state of 1 and 0, or "two states at once". Because each qubit represents two states at once, the total number of states doubles with each added qubit.

                    We built bloqit as a fun game to teach the basics of quantum computing.

                    We built bloqit using

                    , an open-source quantum computing software development framework with tools for creating and manipulating quantum programs and running them on prototype quantum devices and simulators. It follows the circuit model for universal quantum computation, and can be used for any quantum hardware that follows this model.

                    was used for local simulation during this game. The code itself
                    <strong>
                        python
