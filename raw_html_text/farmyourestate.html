                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the StateFarm mission, we wanted to build on the "recover from the unexpected" part to aid users to face any adversity they may encounter.  Essentially, helping people become more self-sufficient
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an incentive based tool to increase communication between customers and agents to help solve any unintended problems that could arise
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the front and back-ends natively using Swift 4 on Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced issues attempting to deploy the application onto a device, so we had to implement it through the simulator offered by Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a well-functioned app within tough time constraints of 24 hours. We also enjoyed the user interface we applied onto our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first opportunity we received to work with Swift and Xcode natively to develop our app.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to set a standard for customer and agent relationships and hopefully allow other companies to build a better system together and to help things go right.
