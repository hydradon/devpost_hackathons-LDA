                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always wanted to tutor others but I always have obscure schedules so helping other learn is not alsways avavilbe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects a user with other students or teaches and they can chat and students can quickly pay the tutros for their service and also get a certification that they were taught by someone skilled
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use react native fro the front end to make an android app and then stripe to handle all the payments and firebase to store accounts and other neceessary data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The only technology that I was use to is firebase and all the other technologies were new to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to functioning market place for education with tools I have never used before in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learn more about react-native, the ease of stripe, and to take a break at hackathons because taking a break, like by walking or going to help others with their app, will help you relax to come back to tackle the problem.
                </p>

                    What's next for Learnet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is to get official certification from coursera so people can be confident they are being taguht by those who know their stuff.
