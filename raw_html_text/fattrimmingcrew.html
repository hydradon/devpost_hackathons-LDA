                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is often difficult to stay motivated if you feel like you are not making any progress in your goals -- whether it be learning to play an instrument or getting physically fit. We look in the mirror or on the scale each day, and feel like we haven't changed, but change happens slowly and isn't always obvious. How can we determine whether we are making progress? We weigh ourselves. If we lose weight, we are more healthy, right? What if we have gained muscle? This is the challenge we run into. We cannot determine how healthy we are based on weight alone.  A child can weigh 120 and a woman can weigh the same but if they are at different heights or have different body fat needs to be healthy - this is not a very good determinant of fitness.Our body composition, as in the amount of body fat or lean mass we have, is more meaningful.

                <p>
                    This is a mobile app to help users visualize and compare their progress to meet either weight or body fat percentage goals. By asking the user for measurements of various points of their body (waist, hips, thighs, etc) , we can approximate the body fat percentage as well as lean body mass, basal metabolic rate, and other relevant information for meeting your body composition goals, whether it to build more muscle, go up a weight class, or stay toned. At this point, we have decided to focus on body fat percentage calculations.

                <p>
                    Right now it is a prototype of the design but the calculations and formulas for the body fat percentage calculations are written out, along with any of the other aforementioned stats. We used Adobe XD and google sheets, with previous existing body measurement data that I collected over a period of 2 years. We used Adobe XD's interactive prototyping to make our project as close to how we would like it to function, including gestures and legible color contrasting / typography. We used several

We also looked at what font options we had that had numerous styles and matched the style of the app we had in mind. We used another

                    of the font and the minimum font size for the screens which would allow us to dynamically resize for different screens. We decided to design on the smallest feasible screen this app might be on, iPhone 6/7/8, to determine what information is important and how to emphasize it using UI/UX concepts rather than design on a larger screen and struggle to get that same information on a smaller screen in the future.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a color palette that was both aesthetically pleasing and functional for accessibility/legibility was difficult. Getting the gesture animation on Adobe to function correctly took some time as well. The design of the graphs took longer than expected and determining the scale and what information would be relevant to the user was the biggest challenge.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a decent design that we are happy with overall, especially with trying to make it as user friendly as possible. In the past, we spent several weeks trying to come up with a good design and choose fonts, sizes, and colors, but this time we got way more done than ever before without too much stress.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use my time more effectively without stressing about the result and creating reachable and incremental goals, which has always been something with which I have struggled. We learned more about the functions in excel/sheets that would help with data visualization in the future.

                <p>
                    We'd like to start programming this for real, possibly in a different language than we have used before if it's more suitable or just to learn another language. We'd also like to add more features and analysis. Hopefully we can either create a companion app that keeps track of your exercise progress such as 1 rep max and sets/reps or include it in a future version of this app.
