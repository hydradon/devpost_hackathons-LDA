                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For my capstone project, I am working with a physically handicap man to create wheelchair accessories. He mentioned he needed a way to call for help in the middle of the night. The goal would be to connect this to the existing Amazon Echo in his home so he could call for help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    wirelessly controlled alarm working over wifi network
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wired up circuit to arduino/particle
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not very skilled in software so programming has been a challenge. Also, it was hard to upload code to the particle over the very crowded wifi network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got the alarm circuit to work, got particle to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time using the particle photon, learned all about it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Assistive Alarm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for Assistive Alarm is to get the device user friendly and connected to the homes of physically handicap.
