                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main reasons people still use plastic water bottles is that the water is simply more convenient and accessible. Water stations aren't everywhere and we don't want to look for them to fill up our water bottles. Enter

                        DropLIT : Hydrate don't Dyedrate.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    DropLIT is a user-submitted website that pinpoints the various hydration stations in a given area. Hydration stations refer to merely filtered water bottle refilling stations. Initially, there are hydration stations around the UC Davis Campus that have been inputed by the developers. To incentivize users to pinpoint new hydration stations, the website will provide various metrics including the amount of money the user has saved and total water drank.

                            : The Arcadia Group explains that per year, the average American drinks nearly $3000 in water bottles. Switching to a reusable water bottle will save you, on average $2900. Knowing where to fill up your bottle means you fill it up more, and thus save more money.

                            : Nearly 17 million oil barrels are used to produce over 50 billion water bottles, of which only 20% are recycled properly. By creating a user-driven service, once widely-produced, will create a significant dent in oil production and the amount of water bottled produced and thrown away.
