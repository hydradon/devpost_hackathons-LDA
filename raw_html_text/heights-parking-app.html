                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is currently a heights parking whatsapp group that is horribly inefficient
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses map interface to clearly mark an open spot so users can find parking easier
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio as well as google maps api to develop this application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fully understanding the google maps api and navigating through Android Studio for the first time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working prototype with big plans for the future
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can't change the world in 24 hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Heights Parking App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we hope to connect someone looking for a spot with someone leaving a spot as well as have the 
map distinguishe between legal and illegal parking spots
