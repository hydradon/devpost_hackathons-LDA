                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were initially inspired by rSync and it's rolling checksum algorithms. We decided after a day of theory crafting that we can write multiple algorithms that follow a similar principle to minimize bandwidth usage at the cost of CPU.

                    The algorithm is very sophisticated. If you can think of a data structure, we probably used it.
