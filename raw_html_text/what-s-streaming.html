                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many video streaming services available today each with different content. It is very cumbersome to go through all the various services to see if specific content is available. Let Alexa recommend movies that you can actually watch with your available streaming services. In-Skill purchases enable greater filtering capabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's Streaming will recommend movies to watch based on the services that the user has configured. The basic skill will provide movie recommendations based on what services the user has available. The In-Skill Purchase will enable expanded search and filter options such as Genre, Film Duration, Age Rating, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the skill using the Alexa Developer Console to build the interaction model and Lambda handle the back end using node.js SDK. In addition, we built an API to handle the movie requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few minor issues ranging from mapping all available options from the movie database to slot types to trying to handle the natural conversation flow using reprompts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a database with an API that the alexa skill can access to find the available streaming movies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build an Alexa Skill and add the In-Skill Purchasing Option. We also learned how to quickly build a lambda function to support the Alexa Skill.
