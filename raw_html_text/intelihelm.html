                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This helmet is engineered to improve bike safety and confidence while cycling. Our goal was to design a helmet that improves bike-user interaction by notifying the rider to changes in their surroundings, such as an approaching car, this will be displayed as a distance on the rider's phone. This helmet has the ability to inform cars of decisions made by the cyclist, through LED lights, activated by voice commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the use of an Arduino Uno, Android Java development software, and a watermelon helmet, we were able to design a bike safety system. We used a bluetooth module to communicate between the helmet and the phone, speech api allowing the user to operate the system hands-free, an ultrasonic sensor to detect approaching cars, and led lights to signal to surrounding motorists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Things we struggled with
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bluetooth connection between the phone and the helmet (the Arduino) proved to be much more difficult than expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were most proud of the fact that we were able to deliver a functioning product by the end of the hackathon. With 3 team members that have never coded before, or been to a hackathon, we did not believe that the odds were in our favor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the coaching of our one experienced member, we learned the basics of android studio and Arduino programming. We also learned how to assemble the basic circuits and wiring of an Arduino board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Intelihelm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, we would like to have included an accelerometer that would detect when a cyclist was in a crash. This would allow the user to communicate their situation with a predesignated set out people. Additionally, the presentation of the product would need to be refined with the use of much brighter LEDs, and a more aerodynamic appearance.
