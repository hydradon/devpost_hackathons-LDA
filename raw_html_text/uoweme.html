                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we are living in apartments with multiple roommates, we have had troubles splitting bills or grocery items amongst each other. So for our project, 'uOweMe', we wanted to find a way to simplify paying our bills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main feature of this app is its option to evenly split a bill, like for monthly utilities or food, amongst group members when adding a payment request. On the latter, if the user does not know which member to charge, he/she can manually input a list of items or scan a receipt that autocompletes the list. Then the members can select which items from the list to pay for to save the hassle of figuring out the charge amounts. Other features include a home screen that shows how much the user owes in a group and vice versa, and also setting reminders to settle payments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was mainly coded using React-Native JS language. We implemented firebase for authentication and security. We also used React-Native, Python, Google Cloud Platform for storage, cloud vision, and cloud functions to process receipts to text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had miscommunications in the beginning on how we all wanted the different functions and outlook of the application to look like, so we took some time to dispute our differences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Taking an image and turning it into an itemized list
-UI/UX design

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our developers learned how to use Google Cloud Platforms, new API's, and image-to-text processing. 
Some team members are also new to React-Native, so they been able to learn and practice this new language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for uOweMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We do plan to continue improving our app as we find that it has a much better UI/UX, and hope that we are able to fine tune and implement more features.
