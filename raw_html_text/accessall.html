                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt as though our app can promote change in public spaces by encouraging them to be more accessible for people with disabilities.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to rate the accessibility of a location (restaurant, parks, etc.) to increase awareness for the lack of accessibility and encourage said locations to better suite their businesses for people with disabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React, NodeJS, Google Maps API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into was being able work with the google api and implementing it with React in a short amount of time. More so, sticking to what we know rather than picking up something new.
