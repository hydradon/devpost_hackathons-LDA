                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Members of our team have personal experiences with panic attacks and know that when you're in the middle of one, there's not much else you can focus on. We wanted to create an app that could be used hands-free with minimal voice controls, so the Google Home was a perfect match.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PANda Pause guides the user through a panic attack. It calms anxiety by playing relaxing music, guiding them through deep breathing, or guiding them through relaxing their body.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it through Google's Dialogflow API which let us configure responses to various phrases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had used Dialogflow prior to this so we had to learn from scratch. We weren't quite sure of what it was capable of doing or how to execute it, and we don't have the experience necessary to modify the actual back-end code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app is genuinely useful for people and is easier to use in the middle of a panic attack than a phone app would be. We were able to modify the voice to be more calm and natural.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to quickly find information on a brand new API and apply it. We learned some of the possibilities of Google Home apps and how they could be useful in different ways than phone apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PANda Pause
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to learn how to include more features like calling loved ones, turning down the brightness on smart lights, and providing distractions to focus on.
