                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew we wanted to do an AR experience and we wanted to try something around context-sensitive or space-sensitive language practice. We couldn't get the language piece working, but some of what we had already done transferred nicely to an AR game inspired by
                    <em>
                        Pac-Man
                    </em>
                    .

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Invisible Octopus Invaders have landed. We didn&rsquo;t have time to perfect our OctoLens goggles, so you can only see them through a very narrow band that expands your visible light spectrum. But you can hear them coming. Don&rsquo;t let them touch you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Run around and collect coins while avoiding giant octopuses.
Run and hide behind furniture.
Listen closely for their approaches and dodge them.
Pick up a flamethrower to ward them off for a few seconds.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scene built in Unity using C# and deployed to HoloLens. Models/particle effects: some custom, some sketchfab.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many hours spent configuring machine for deployment to HoloLens.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A quick pivot that used what we had done so far and turned it into something we could ship.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got experience with Unity, HoloLens, design, story, and whimsy!
