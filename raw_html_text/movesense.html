                    &nbsp;Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MoveSense sensor can provide information of acceleration, angular acceleration and magnetic field. So we come out with an idea that, as long as it can sense the body movements of people to help improving the sports performance and monitoring body health. It can also reflect the body action into the game, to control the characters in the game fight against each other with body movements instead of keyboard. 
Playing old games in a new way is cool and awesome!

                    &nbsp;What&nbsp;it&nbsp;does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a motion sensing game based on a classic game called "the king of the fighters", which is a 2-d game fighting game. We use movesense to sense body movements like punching, jumping and kicking&hellip; to have two people fighting against each other in the game.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MOVESENSE has api for iOS app, so we built an app to receive acceleration data from the sensor, analyze the data and send operations to the computer by http POST. In the mean time we built a django program to receive the data from the phone and simulate the operation by WinAPI, like key &lsquo;J&rsquo; for &lsquo;hit&rsquo; and key &lsquo;A&rsquo; / &lsquo;D&rsquo; for &lsquo;left&rsquo; and &lsquo;right&rsquo;.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge is how to let the phone communicate with the computer. We used http POST for the phone and django for the computer. Second is how to decide the move from acceleration data. We found out that the absolute value of the acceleration can be used to decide whether this is a &lsquo;hit&rsquo; and the direction of the acceleration can be used to decide the moving direction.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our project, we alert a 14-year-old game, The King of Fighters, into a motion sensing game. This antique game brings back the memory of our childhood and makes us realize that old game can be updated with new technology as well.
