                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to use hardware for the first time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The raspberry pi is supposed to be used as a security camera 
The qualcomm dragonboard is supposed be used to display stuff
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Raspberry Pi and Qualcomm Dragon board. Programmed in python for the Pi and C++ for the other
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware problems, and lack of documentation for the Qualcomm dragon board
We had missing hardware for the pi, and only got late.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not sure as of yet, however, we will continue to work on the security cam if its not done as this is something that would be great to use whenever we want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to handle hardware, and program on them
                </p>

                    What's next for HardwareMess
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the projects to work so that we can use it when we need it.
