                    The inspiration for this project indirectly came from a sibling.

                    Caleb, our UI guy, has a little brother who enjoys remixing music. (He makes dank beats.) While free software to edit music is all over the place (literally, I just downloaded Audacity at 2AM this morning to cut some sound samples), making live music with editing software is basically impossible. You need a hookup to an electronic keyboard or other cool contraption for the user to remix live.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So for the longest time, Caleb's been meaning to get his brother some music hardware, like a

                    or an

                    . However, that hardware is incredibly expensive, and we're still college students: fiscal obligation to government/lenders/parental units, gotta pay off tuition before making sweet tunes, no job, so on so forth. Caleb was gonna have to put that plan off for a while.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we got accepted to HackTech. (And subsequently needed an idea for something to do.)

                    Thus, "keymix." A sick little portmanteau of "keyboard" and "remix," the title says it all. You get to upload sound samples, play 'em and stop 'em whenever you want, and map sounds in ten different keymaps, which can be imported between sessions. The only hardware you need--a keyboard and a mouse/trackpad--is provided with your computer, which most aspiring remixers need regardless. We're planning to keep this open source, so anyone who wants to make it better can.
