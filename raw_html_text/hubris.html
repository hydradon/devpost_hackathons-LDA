                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by being femme people with an online presence and understanding the everyday dangers of harassment online. Uplift's message connected to us and we knew that they were doing important work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This twine text-based online game explores what it's like to try to build a 3D game in Unity in 24 hours with nothing but some Java experience and a lot of passion. (and coffee)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started in Unreal Engine, then switched to Unity for better VR and mentor help, then VR fell through. At around 8 am, we made the call to abandon Unity and switch to twine to explore our dialogue tree and show off our process in a self-referential game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything. Literally everything that could have gone wrong - hardware, software, bugs, experience - did go wrong. There were multiple computer crashes in one hour. It got real.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EVERYTHING! We learned so much about ourselves, how we work, and what we can do under pressure. We also learned some C#!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work as a team, how to handle frustration, how to effectively budget time, and new coding languages and processes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HUBRIS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to continue working with Uplift and maybe come back to this project with more experience.
