                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original idea was to make a projected keyboard in which an IR camera would detect keystrokes but once we realised we didn't have the right parts we scraped that idea (which was too big and bulky anyway) and made the next best thing a super convenient remote input program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The keyboard can be accesed online where you may also choose your preferred keyboard type (early version only includes QWERTY and midi boards) once selected a simple python program needs to be executed on the PC to be used and from there the application is ready to use!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The keyboards were created with html and CSS.
A python script that uses the pyautogui library was used to read characters from the server and invoke the PC keyboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire project and most of the technologies used were very new to all of us. We struggled to rethink, learn and create something new all in 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    Further upgrades for this project include a wider variety of keyboards and and application that allow you to custom make whatever input device you would like, from a touch screen controller to a single giant button just for fun.
