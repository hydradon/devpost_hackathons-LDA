                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the lack of usefulness of old objects that could still be used by others such as books and tools. We firmly believe in reusing old things and not letting them gather dust and buying used instead of new. Troc is all about making a city intelligent by reducing its ecological footprint and connecting people with similar interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects people by allowing them to lend, borrow or trade items from each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built using a node.js backend with the express framework, the website is rendered using jade templates and bootstrap and the persistence layer consists of a mySQL database. Everything is hosted on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of technological problems related to authentication and want into a few walls trying to render properly the front end using bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to have a fully functional app hosted on the cloud with few &laquo;prototyping&raquo;&nbsp;restraints, the app has a real use and we explored new techs we didn't have much experience with which was a good occasion learn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about templating and front end technologies, but I think we learned much more about how to manage time during a 24 hour hackathon, handling fatigue, organizing and taking critical time constrained decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Troc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Different and more efficient ways to find an item you want. A way to land things instead of trading them permanently. A reputation system that makes you feel safe about who you're lending your things to.
