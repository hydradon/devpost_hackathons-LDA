                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last year I competed in the White House's Mental Health Hackathon. I learned that 40 million adults experience anxiety disorders and I wanted to figure out a way to help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Viate provides relief from panic attacks by transporting its users to a relaxing environment. We introduce a technique called Grounding to the users. Grounding consists of making users aware of their environment while having panic attacks. Since users are focusing on specific objects, it helps slow down their racing thoughts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the environment in Unity and viewed it through Oculus rift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had trouble with Glare Input for the simulation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the entire environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to import and manipulate assets as well as design inside of Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Viate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, hopefully we can get the experience fully functioning.
