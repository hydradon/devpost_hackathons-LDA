                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As expecting parents my wife and I constantly find ourselves asking what food is or isn't safe. It isn't something that's easy to Google as there's too much contradictory low-quality information out there and also you often don't want to look things up on your smartphone while you're already preparing food. Hence an Alexa skill makes sense as it allows a structured search of relevant information via a helpful voice user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill answers questions succinctly based on current medical guidance about a what is and isn't safe for pregnant women. It is a really simple idea, but I've tried to put a lot of effort into the database, the matching algorithm (including fuzzy matching, and especially the voice design to make it as easy and effective as possible. It also give helpful visual indicators and gives randomised helpful voice searches to try based on examples that are useful or interesting in some way or another.

                <p>
                    Node.js, AWS, Lambda, various scripts to automate test and deployment

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll add tons more items to the database to make it the most comprehensive resource available. May also add different types of information or create a variant that gives food advice to different audiences.
