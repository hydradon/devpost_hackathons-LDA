                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a problem at transfering small file from a device to another ( Like Drive or Whatsapp web are used at everywhere, but it is not very easy)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Read QR on PC via Device such as phone, upload file to site, transfer the file to pc easily without no write anything only reading QR and select file
It isnt required any program, it is based on web for camera and file transfer
                </p>
