                    HackerSpin is a fun trivia game for computer science knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HackerSpin was inspired by games like Trivia Crack, which are a fun way of learning new things. I wanted to make a similarly styled game that quizzed you on computer science trivia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game could be used both by people new to programming and seasoned veterans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game consists of 5 categories:
-Famous Figures
-Computer Science History
-Hacker Culture &amp; Media
-Programming
-Hardware
                </p>
                <p>
                    A player spins the wheel and answers the question on the category they got.
