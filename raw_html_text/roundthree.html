                    Cavalry is an SMS-based medical walkthrough for world travelers and those who live in rural areas without easy access to emergency medical attention. It introduces a simple, fast interface that allows you to quickly arrive to a life-saving solution in the critical first few minutes after onset of an injury. All of our data is stored on the cloud, and can be accessed with a simple cellular connection without the need of a smartphone with data.

                    Cavalry currently walks through a series of yes or no questions to arrive to a treatment plan. We hope to soon utilize machine learning and natural language processing to allow for more open-ended questions, which allows for more patient-specific treatment plans. Our algorithm also allows for easy scalability and addition of features, which we hope to use to allow for the possibility of over-the-phone medical consults.
