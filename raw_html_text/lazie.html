                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first-year students at Columbia, we've come to discover the difficulty in managing time in university. Busy with our studies and lives, students constantly face time constraints. Lazie aims to connect students with spare time, with those who need to finish every day tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lazie is your platform for everyday errands. It connects students who want to do and those who want to ask. Students who ask are people who have requests - from walking a dog, to saving a spot in the library - and students who do are those who complete them. We allow students create an account in which they can both do and ask, keeping track of errands that they requested and errands that they are running. We help students save both time and earn a bit of extra money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the back-end of the code using Flask, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Jinja and Python. For the front-end, we used CSS and HTML to code the page designs. We further used Invision after our wireframing process to create a MVP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of beginner coders, we had a difficult time connecting our varying sources of knowledge together to create a cohesive platform. With preliminary knowledge in a select amount of languages, we had to learn while we made the platform. Connecting the front-end and back-end while leveraging data was one of our greatest challenges. This experience was a great learning opportunity for all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how far we have come with our product despite our level of expertise. We were able to come up with a product idea that we love, code that functioned succesfully, and the prototype of a platform that we think could be highly influential for college students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lazie
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lazie is currently operating on a website, but we hope to develop it towards an app. With its flexibility and open-ended nature, Lazie has the ability to transcend beyond the university campus and into corporate and community life.
