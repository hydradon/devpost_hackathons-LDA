                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We were inspired by students in our school who have learning disabilities; we wanted to create something that accommodates their learning styles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our passion for technology stemmed from a required technology class that we took in freshman year.

                <p>
                    Our virtual reality program is personalized for every student to aid them in the subjects that they struggle the most in. Students learn in different ways, and our method provides a more interactive and hands-on experience for students that learn through visual and kinesthetic experiences. Most teachers in school neglect these learning methods, which alienates some students. Our program is built to solve this issue. In our demo we will be focusing on biology by simulating a white blood cell engulfing an invading bacterium in the process of phagocytosis.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Unity to execute our Virtual Reality Game. After studying, numerous tutorials and sample codes we were able to program our game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never tried C# coding or Virtual Reality software. It was a frustrating experience at first because of the learning curve, but ended up being extremely rewarding in the end. It was also difficult for us to identify and fix errors in our code due to our inexperience with C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major accomplishment was learning the basics of C# in such a short amount of time. We're also proud we managed to develop our program according to our vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of time management, teamwork, and problem-solving.
                </p>

                    What's next for XR Education using VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're looking forward to expanding this program to include more games and subjects. In the end, we hope this program will appeal to all kinds of students.
