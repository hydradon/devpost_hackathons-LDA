                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The theme for this hackathon was full circle, which got me thinking about how success is created. It requires tedious hard work, and even the most successful people must have small jobs before their big break. However, if people cannot find small jobs, they are less likely to pursue their dreams and strive for greater things. This website is good for people who want to look for temporary and simple jobs on their way to something greater, starting the circle. Immigrants, refugees, and even new college graduates will find this very helpful.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aspiring workers can choose their city and see what jobs are available for them, what the hours and days are like, and how to contact the employers to apply. Hiring employers can also add their company to the lists, so it is a site for both sides. Additionally, there are tabs for workers where they can learn how to create a perfect resume and to nail their interview. These tabs help the workers get the jobs they want, encouraging them to keep working harder.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML, CSS, and javascript to create this project. There are many different pages that are interconnected through buttons and tabs.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a few challenges with creating a javascript dropdown menu and interactive textboxes. These issues were fixed after much detailed troubleshooting.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the javascript I used, as I was not too familiar with the language. I was surprised with my success in integrating these aspects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned many aspects of javascript through many online tutorials and informational sites as I was trying to integrate much more than I had previously known.
