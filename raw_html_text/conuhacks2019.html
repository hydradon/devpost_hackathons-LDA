                    We wanted to challenge ourselves to build a video-game in 24h using Java. What we came up with is this top-down single player action game. The original plan was to make it multiplayer by having players connect to a local server but unfortunately, the implementation was very buggy and not stable.

                    The biggest challenge was to get the game running in local multiplayer. It worked, but unfortunately, it was too buggy to play (eg. very high ping in excess of 1000) so we switched to a single player mode.

                    Looking ahead, we would want to implement a:

                <p>
                    Get better graphics.
