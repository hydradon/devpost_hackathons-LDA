                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over our coding classes we have learned how to make several kinds of games. We decided to incorporate this into our program as well as some more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two games you can choose from: Mad Libs or a fighting simulator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using html, javascript and some css, we created a functioning program. Each program references to another one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were some challenges with key presses, but a few good google searches sorted that out. Also, the opponent for the fighting simulator sometimes didn't change. This was solved by changing a single =  in some if statements to two equal signs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Something we are proud of is creating a world hub where you can choose which world you want to go to. Another thing is that in our fighting simulator, the third stage of the first world/level is very difficult and has only been beaten 4 or 5 times by the creators each.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that working together is key, and that communication helps sort many things out. To create a successful program, you must stay focused for the
                    <em>
                        entire
                    </em>
                    time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Games
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking of adding health/progress bars in the fighting simulator, adding animations to the attacks, and maybe adding a multiplayer game, as well as adding better graphics overall.
