                        Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    Mixed reality is a newer field of the virtual reality-related medium. If you already had a virtual reality environment, this game could be an application within that environment. This project is contributing to a very new idea and is changing the way we experience entertainment. A simple action for your physical body, such as throwing a dart, can have a new joy when experiencing it in your virtual body.

                    <strong>
                        What It Does
                    </strong>
                    Every dart thrown acts in the style typical to the tower defense genre. After they are thrown, they become defensive assets that deliver damage to incoming enemies. Every successful throw onto the board creates a turret, or defensive tower that shoots at the waves of approaching bugs.
