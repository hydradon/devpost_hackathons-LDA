                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was inspired by the two-player web games of our childhood, and the rubber ducks at our desk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a two-player platforming game in which one player is a duck trying to reach a bathtub, and the second player controls obstacles and traps to try to kill the duck.
