                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every morning, we realized that we check the weather to decide what to wear for the day, utilizing 2-4 minutes that could be better spent elsewhere. Regardless, we usually seem to go out and about in the wrong clothing choices, so we were inspired to create an easy solution to this problem with our android app, Fit4Forecast!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app takes into account all the factors of weather (temperature, humidity, wind speed) and provides the user with a perfect match of the articles of clothing for the day, thus making the user fit for the forecast! The app also allows us to save time in the morning by allowing us to make one less decision in our very hectic lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the OpenWeatherMap API to collect live weather statistics, including temperature (current, high, and low), wind speed, and a description of the weather, from a plethora of cities in the United States, updating regularly. To devise the app, we implemented this API in Android Studio. While some members were creating the sophisticated and user-friendly interface, others were taking the data from the API, converting to the Imperial system for units and calculating other factors affecting clothing choices, such as wind chill. From the data that we collected, we integrated them to provide a more accurate choice for clothing so it was not only based on temperature. We also made sure to store the user's last location, to make it convenient when they open the app again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major problems that our team ran into was that the OpenWeatherMap API wouldn&rsquo;t work. It took a while to generate the API key and then we needed to learn how to utilize the data that it provided in a json file. Moreover, our team didn't know much about android studio, so we spent a lot of time learning how to use it and generate an android app. Some of the functions that we learned include: creating multiple pages, creating buttons, storing data onto the phone, and debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are especially proud of the fact that despite we didn't know much about android studio and the implementation of APIs, we were able to create a fully functional app that we could use in our daily lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into this project, none of us had any experience with creating mobile apps or Android Studio, but now, we are well-versed in the field of making Android apps using the software. We also learned how to integrate an API and extract information that was beneficial to our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fit4Forecast
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing the tremendous amount of knowledge we learned, we are looking forward to improving upon our app by taking into account more aspects of the weather, such as humidity, to make more accurate clothing choices. Additionally, we would like to have user input in their style choices to make the app more personalized for the user.
