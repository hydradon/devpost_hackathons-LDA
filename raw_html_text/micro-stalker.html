                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Akhil Abraham talked about his major, cyber security. Jeechieu subsequently pitched an idea of trying to practically use information to help in one's professional interactions. Since it was each of our first times at a hackathon, we chose to work on this impulse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes the some of the non-invasive information of one's online identity to identify a person. Then, using back-end code based searches, a report is created on the front-end interface to show what this identified person does professionally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using Visual Studio in conjunction with Microsoft Azure for the front-end code and interface. For back-end searching and scripting, we're using SSH in conjunction with a virtual machine on Microsoft Azure to execute the searching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With very little relevant programming experience, we spent a lot of time running in circles or learning for long periods of times. The final result may be an not optimal system in terms of software. There was also a lot of shifting in what languages, software, and methods to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that we each learned a great deal over the past 2 days, and were motivated to get a job done. Hearing of other groups that break apart under the pressure of no sleep, or no progress humbles me. I, Jeechieu, am grateful that this weekend worked out as productive as it was.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned whats the next step in learning software engineering. This was literally my first step into any type of work in programming. It was an enlightening experience, especially the workshops. I learned how API's can differ, how different programs can function together in ways I didn't know prior, I project I'll learn a lot in the presentations, and finally I learned the true realistic values of learning software engineering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Micro Stalker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personally, with the busy schedule I'll be having these next months, in conjunction with the conviction I gained to work even harder on the next Pennapps Hackathon, this idea may end up scrapped by the end of this ordeal. I'd appreciate an mobile app like this to exist, many a times I found myself in the grand presence of a high up official, but actually knew nothing about them. It was sort of embarrassing once to talk to the vice-president of GE electrics on a level that doesn't even skim his professional expertise.
