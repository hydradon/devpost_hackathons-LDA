                    Inspiration: We wanted to solve a real-world problem that solves a big problem for consumers in the restaurant industry. We realized that there is no online portal where people can go to reserve a specific table at a restaurant. So, we decided to make one.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: We created a website where people can register/login, and search for the name of the restaurant they want to book a table for. The consumer will be given a blueprint layout of the restaurant, where they can select and reserve for a time slot for a specific table. The user can select the timings, and checkout. If the table is already booked for that time slot, user will be notified, and will have to choose another table if he/she wishes to proceed.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used CSS3, HTML5, PHP, SQL, JQUERY to build our website.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: While working on the website, we had to learn and format the code using intermediate css and php.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: Given the time frame of the project, we are very proud that we were able to develop a basic functioning website. We are proud that we were able to implement intermediate CSS to make the website more visually appealing.

                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned to work with intermediate CSS3, PHP and SQL.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Nexit: We see our website as becoming the go-to place for restaurant reservation. All though it is not fully completed, we plan to continue to develop, add more features, and hopefully evolve it to a viable business.
