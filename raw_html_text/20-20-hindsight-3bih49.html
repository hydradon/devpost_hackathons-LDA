                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea for this came project came from us looking at ourselves. As we noticed that we would spend hours on end staring at our computers, we wanted some way to remind ourselves to take a break sometimes.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project using tensorflow and google vision to track humans. We then used python and opencv to capture the video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into trouble having tensorflow work and actually recognize that people were in front of the webcam. We also trouble displaying the video in opencv because Ubuntu is not fully compatible with opencv.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we managed to put something in a small amount of time. Because we're all first-years in college, we were inexperienced with building projects from scratch. We also used programs that we never used before in a fun and creative way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how difficult it is to work with tensorflow and new programs in general. Also, we learned that some programs are easier to use in Windows, while others are easier to use in Ubuntu.

                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to incorporate this project into a chrome extension, so others can easily use our project.
