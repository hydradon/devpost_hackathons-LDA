                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every generation has some sort of telekinetic super power - Star Wars had the force, Harry Potter had a wand battle and we have our current day generation ProfessorX: Cerebral Wars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using two MUSE EEG headbands, we train in semi-real-time two individuals to prepare them for a meditation battle using a RaspberryPi B+ as the stand-alone appliance.  Between the two players, there is an LED strip driven by our software indicating who is winning.  The winner is the one who meditates the most during a specified period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created several machine learning libraries, a hardware setup, custom Linux distribution and created this mental para-dime according to current machine learning and neural literature.  As a team, each person was responsible for a component and it came together to form Cerebral Wars.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware not quite behaving as expected - LED/SPI strip from China.
Time for the complexity and scope of this project
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting this all to come together, while having two new team members join us in an autonomous fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thank some deity for giving us the idea to borrow a logic analyser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cerebral Wars
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding sound and haptic feedback to add an extra dimension to the platform/demo as well as irritate the winner.
