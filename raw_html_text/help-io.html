                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we got our inspiration from the Impact Partner Prompt 2, how do we know if there are side effects with medication? How might that be impacting a patients mental health and overall wellness?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To combat this problem we built two parts, a web application which visualizes data and an app where the data would be inputted. This data visualizer built into the website allows the physician to quickly understand the patient's symptoms and how the medication is working over time. This website allows for data storage so if there is a switch of a physician, there is still data that persists for the new physician, allowing for better diagnosis and a better outcome for all! This solution solves many things. A change of physicians often brings physicians back to square one for diagnosis, this is an issue clearly. Another issue it does solve is that it allows visualization of the effects of a drug over time. This allows the physicians to make data-driven decisions to lead to a better outcome. Also by a lot of data being inputted before the patient-physician appointment, the doctor will be able to get a bigger and better picture of the entire story of the patient and how he feels. The length of these appointments are short and having a concise database that a physician can access anytime will definitely allow for a better outcome.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using many different languages. We used Java for Android App Development. We used Figma for UI design. We also used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front end development. For backend development, we used Node.js, Express.js, and Firestore as our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was definitely connecting the data to the database, inputting the data as well as pulling the data, processing it and being able to input that data into the data visualizer. Another issue was with users and authentication. We definitely struggled with the backend and databases.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to deliver not only one application, but two that work together to solve a problem that is prevalent in the medical community!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely learned a lot as a team. We learned how to visualize data in the browser as well as using Firebase. Lots were learned about Android App Development for sure.
                </p>

                    What's next for BrilliantCare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a fully functional database connection from the input(Android Application) as well as the output (Web Application). This will allow the app to be fully functional. Another improvement would be the UI and design overall of both the Web Application and the Android Application
