                    We wanted to be ambitious to incorporate as many challenges as possible. And so, we created a complicated app integrated IoT that talks to a Qualcomm microcontroller - the DragonBoard 410C. We also incorporated a mock bank account that reminds its users to donate their money and support their local communities by pushing a, sourced online, link that sends them to their nearest food bank. We have a timer-based notification system that makes passwords seem like a thing of a past and successfully locks out users that input the wrong authentication key after a few attempts. We used a server-sided receiver program that talks to our code on the Android app using IP sockets and a Linux server. Together they successfully create a secure, local IoT and security coupling.

                    We are a happy group of suite mates all studying ECE. This is our first Hackathon and we had a great time.
