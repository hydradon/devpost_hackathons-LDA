                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GM already has an app for audiobooks. Why not have one for podcasts?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It listens to the contents of the podcasts, and tries to pick out ones similar to the ones the user has already listened to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use RevSpeech to transcribe the podcasts, and then use
                    <code>
                        doc2vec
                    </code>
                    to make a vector representation of the transcription. These high dimensional vectors approximate the semantic meaning of the podcast. We use these to pick similar one to what the user has listened to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We trained the vector representations on Spell's machine learning platform, using the API to initiate experiments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to transcribe a large volume of podcast data. We have been able to do this thanks to the generosity of the RevSpeech team. Thank you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also had trouble interfacing the different components of the system, from missing data that should be attached to the transcript to the format of the feature vectors being passed around.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully used machine learning algorithms to create a system which recommends related podcasts. We have also managed to produce an attractive and useable interface.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Python is a great language for rapid prototyping, but the lack of interface definitions often make it hard to use.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should be able to produce a more elaborate mathematical model for the recommendations.
We might also expand to other platforms.
