                    Inspiration: We wanted to do several things during this hackathon. Those things included wanting to learn something new, taking on a crazy idea, and solving a problem in a way that hasn't been solved before. So our inspiration was creating a new way to train workers for the American Airlines company.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: This project creates a simulation of a pilot going through maintenance before flight. This includes checking conditions like the compass, pushing the throttle, testing the engines, and other conditions. These are meant to prepare a pilot for what he should be checking for before a flight. This is also an issue from the pilots, as it has been found that pilots do not use a maintenance list when they should, leading to more issues. We not only made a cheap way to teach pilots without an airplane, but also made it more efficient by combining new technologies that can interact with the real world.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We spent 24 hours creating 3D models, hundreds of schematics, and scrapping hundreds of ideas for our prototype. Through the use of Oculus Rift, Unity, Blender, and the Leap Motion system, we created a very easy to use and easy to learn system for pilots to see what it's like to take maintenance before flight.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: None of our team had any experience with Unity or Blender before this competition. We all had to learn to use Blender and Unity to get our massive idea from our paper into reality.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We learned so much more about 3D modeling with blender, learned how to use the APKs for Oculus and Leap Motion, and learned how awesome and fun hackathons are. We all learned several new things and adapted to situations we never knew we could overcome.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned so much more about 3D modeling with Blender and how to program and setup games with Unity. We also saw how much potential there is for VR to develop, seeing first hand how cool the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion are. We learned to work as a team to learn new things together and quickly, even though we knew none of it before TAMUHackl

                <h2>
                    What's next for Pilot Training Simulator: We would like to make use of hololens to combine the real world with maintenance, comparing what's in the real world to images in VR, combining the use of computer vision with workers checking maintenance to increase efficiency and to create more training scenarios with VR.
