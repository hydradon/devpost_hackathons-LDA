                    The creation of our game, Boof, was inspired by the simple, yet addictive games which people could without much commitment. When we arrived at this hackathon, the only language that we had prior experience with was Java. Thus, in order to create our game, all of us needed to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within a single night, as well as utilize our new knowledge to create a web game.
