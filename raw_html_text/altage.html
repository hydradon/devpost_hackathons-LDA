                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the EPA, motor vehicles collectively cause 75 percent of carbon monoxide pollution in the United States. Hawai'i is among the top 10 electric vehicle markets in America. There are currently more than 10,000 electric vehicles. However, there are only 16 operating EV charging stations, 9 of which are located on Oahu. The lack of EV charging stations discourages consumers from converting to an electric vehicle. While the number of cars on the road increases, the air quality decreases with it. Altage wants to contribute to making the local, and eventually global, society more sustainable by creating a product that incentivizes consumers to think sustainable and purchase an electric vehicle instead of a gasoline car. Therefore, we want to contribute to the future by providing organizations such as Hawaiian Electric with a tool to analyze, manage and visually depict processed data to users working with EV charging stations to better understand the collected data after charging cycles and to predict anomalies based on the data given.

                <p>
                    We used R to pre-process the data according to Hawaiian Electric's requirements. Furthermore, we used Salesforce to display the data with the use of visually pleasing graphs and charts.

                <p>
                    We intend to further develop the application by implementing Machine Learning into the product as a way for the users to predict data anomalies and congestion. Thereby, users will be able to take action early to prevent future issues.
Furthermore, the front-end application can be worked with to include more functionalities and details.
