                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cognate is a chatbot that lets you have a conversation while learning a foreign language. You can select from 3 languages (French, Spanish, and Chinese), and the bot will have a conversation with you in that language. At any time during the conversation, you can put a word you don't know in {brackets}, and the bot will show you the translation of that word as well as how it fits into the sentence!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Gupshup, the platform for creating chatbots.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, Gupshup literally would not make GET requests. We have no idea why. We spent 2 hours trying to fix it. We couldn't move on with the development of our project because our API didn't work properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we DO have
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost nothing, since GET requests don't work, but we have the bot framework ready, we can isolate the words that are marked for translation, we can put them in a translator-ready format, and we can actually translate the sentences (manually).
