                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've decided to build this project because nowadays 3d printing is beeing more popular and the industry demands more people working on it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to manage a whole network of 3D printers using the web interface with live statistics of all the machines allowing you to mass-produce 3D models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using diferent showftware such as: Python, PHP, Javascript, C#, HTML, CSS, MySQL, etc
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had lots of trouble dedicating hours to avoid using sequential codes and just run into a full working one. Now It's actually pretty stable so we're proud of it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole thing is for as a huge reward, we built a nice showftware with a nice hardware as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of project leading and project management as well as developing new skills for

                    What's next for 3D Printer Network Manager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would be very happy to continue developing it since it can be much better by adding lots of modules and stuff!
