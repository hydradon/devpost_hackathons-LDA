                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this mirror after seeing similar but less sophisticated versions of it online. We upgraded some of its functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mirror Mirror displays all of the information you may need to jump start your day right on your mirror. With things like google calendar integration, Weather updates, and New York Times headlines. It also responds to some commands via voice
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built mirror mirror with a raspberry pi a monitor and some one way mirror film. Overlaying the film on the monitor we were able to display information underneath a mirror. Using PHP, and Javascript we were able to have the pi communicate with a laptop acting as a microphone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into included problems with voice recognition, as well as microphone input. We forgot a microphone for the pi so we had to improvise by using a laptop to record and recognize the audio then send the transcript to the pi which would process all of the input and respond.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the microphone work around I created and how it worked so well.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about various apis including open weather map, and google calendar

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whats next is to build a permanent version of the mirror and to continually upgrade its functionality
