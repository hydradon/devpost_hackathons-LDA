                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Diagnozing sleep apnea these days is only possible in sleeping labs with special pressure transducers and many cables attached on the user. 85% percent of the population are undiagnosed even though the consecuences are severe (e.g. strokes).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With our app everybody is able to track the heart rate and respiration while he's sleeping. We use IMU enabled headphones to do so.
