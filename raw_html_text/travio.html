                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were driving 2 hours from Dallas to Tyler for this hackathon where we talked about things we love. One of the things I love doing is
                    <strong>
                        collecting frequent flyer miles and traveling all over the world
                    </strong>
                    . So we decided to share this knowledge with everyone in a simple to use chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Any time you shop online, for example at staples.com and it's an airline partner store, it will prompt you to login to your airline account and shop there. For every hundred dollars you spend you can get anywhere from 50 to 2000 frequent flyer points. You need 12,500 points for a domestic flight in the US.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to go with a chrome extension for seamless integration. We built it with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scraping over 4000 rows data from 4 airline shopping programs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to add another airline and make it 4 airlines - Southwest, American, Delta, and United.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to scrape websites for data and working on chrome extensions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Travio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are actually planning to release it to the chrome store because of how useful it is to people who love free travel.
