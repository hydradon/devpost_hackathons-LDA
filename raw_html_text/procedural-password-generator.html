                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Passwords managers suck. We don't suck. Thus our password manager won't suck.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generates passwords procedurally rather than storing things on disk. It also provides a means of end to end encryption for sending the final password to the user from the cloud.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C#, Python, VPS, Soylent

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users would refuse to use a terminal application, so we had to figure out a user interface that the mass public would not mind using.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the most secure password manager in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to learn more about transmission of secure information over the web.
