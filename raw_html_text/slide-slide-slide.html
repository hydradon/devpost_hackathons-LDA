                    Inspiration - from the workshop! It was one of the most interactive workshop and I liked that I could do a lot with Unity.
                </h2>

                    What it does - it's a little cube sliding on a plane!

                <h2>
                    How I built it - I asked mentors for help and consulted Youtube and google.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - bugs! my caps and lower caps. It was really frustrating when I could not follow the tutorial
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - making things happen definitely! Even though this is a slow process but I am really learning.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - how to code C# in a very basic way. I think that everything is pretty intuitive but still tough to be exploring opportunities in such a short time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for slide slide slide! - I want to explore more visuals and add meaning to the blocks.
