                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking of some small struggles that we face in our everyday life, and movies came up. From there, we decided that this was something that would be really useful to people in our generation.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps the user find a movie based on many different categories. Say you're in the mood to watch an 80s movie but you don't know which one, you can click on the 80s category and search through a whole list of 80s movies. Same thing goes with genres, popular films, upcoming films, and specific actors.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to use XCode and a movie API that we found online, however, we couldn't figure out a way to make that fully functional. Instead, we just have a prototype that we created making graphic design pictures on Canva and putting it together on MarvelApp
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our collective lack of coding experience made it very difficult to create an actually functional app. Instead, we had to submit a prototype.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our idea and the time we invested into the project. The past 24 hours were a bit rough, but we think with a little more time and experience we could really make a functional and accurate application.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that creating an app that is fully functional and looks nice is really difficult to do in 24 hours. Also, we learned that with the right people and resources, you can actually accomplish a lot if you really work at it.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to implement the Movie/TV show API and make the app fully functional. Also, we hope to expand to our list of Actors and films.
