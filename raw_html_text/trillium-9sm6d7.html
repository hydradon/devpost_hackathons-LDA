                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by wanting to get back to the roots of genuine human connection to solve social isolation among older adults.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through a digital hub it connects older adults with volunteers and others by common or shared interests. It arranges and schedules a date and time to meet and carry out the interest or activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began with research and understanding who our audience really was and how we wanted to try to resolve the problem. We wanted to really listen to older adult's needs to be able to properly accommodate them in the application. We built the prototype using adobe XD
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When coming up with concepts and ideas we had an issue narrowing down our end goal, and creating a solid base to build off of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of our teamwork and knowing that we weren't afraid to help each other and be open when help was needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's okay to not be able to solve all the parts of the entire problem at one time. In addition to, being able to adapt and broaden our ideas to improve cover the issue more effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trillium
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully it becomes an integrated system that is implemented widely across Ontario and used to it's full potential. We hope that it catches on and with more advances in technology can be taken further to mitigate social isolation.
