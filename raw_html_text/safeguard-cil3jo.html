                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that people with asthma go to places that are not safe for them without knowing they really feel bad when their asthma crisis arrive so we decided to create a application which allows them to determine the places that are a risk to their health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Safeguard gathers your current location by finding the latitude and longitude of your device with the help of the html 5 geolocation API. Next, using the API of Breezometer,  we are able to gather how dangerous the air outside would be for a person with Asthma. Finally, with the use of Twilio, we are able to send a text message to the person to warn them about the hazards in their local area.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using Cloud 9 where we wrote our html, CSS, JavaScript and incorporated our APIs.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few challenges where we faced problems getting our APIs to work correctly and displaying our elements the way we wanted them to be.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating an app that would be able to help people in need and we would like to continue doing similar things in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it takes a while to accomplish our intended goal and that we are always going to face obstacles along the journey to our dreams, but with enough hard work and persistence we can overcome those challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Safeguard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our plans for safeguard in the future are to find ways to help people that suffer from other diseases the same way we helped the people with asthma.
