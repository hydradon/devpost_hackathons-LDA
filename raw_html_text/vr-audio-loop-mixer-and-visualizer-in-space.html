                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like music and space and wanted to try programming in virtual reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can look around space on a platform and select different musical loops organized by bass, drums, leads, and guitars. You can stop and play/refresh at any moment. Ideally there should be an Audio Visualizer aspect to it too, but I might not finish that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Oculus Libraries and free space assets and my own digital music loops in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never programmed for Oculus or VR before at all so it took me a while to figure things out. It's also not terribly revolutionary. I didn't have a lot of time to make loops that all fit nicely together, so some arrangements are pretty nasty sounding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks pretty cool, sounds pretty good with good choices, and it's functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Oculus and what it's like to program in VR. Also find friends who will actually come with me to hackathons next time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VR Audio Loop Mixer and Visualizer in Space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Audio Visualization if I don't finish that aspect of it, the use of controllers, and then probably selecting your own files.
