                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project aimed to resolve the HP challenge  that was proposed in the hackathon( 3D modelling using voice commands ). In our case we wanted to go one step ahead of what was asked and so give the user the ability to define a model using his/her voice , generate it and print it on the go through octoprint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our service, uses an Android App for voice recognition and user interface together with a server built on top of the preexisting Octoprint project running on a Raspberry Pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An android app converts voice to text and interprets the meaning of what was asked in terms of what model to generate and  what parameters to apply together with generating an open scad file and sending it to the raspberry pi server through FTP.
The Raspberry PI server compiles the models and automates the slicing and printing process within octoprint.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    First time working with ftp on android.
Problems installing and compiling OpenScad in the raspberry.
"hacking" the octoprint homepage to automate print job request.

                <p>
                    We are really proud about the app, as it does big part of the functionality.
building this project in 36 hours in our first international hackathon
