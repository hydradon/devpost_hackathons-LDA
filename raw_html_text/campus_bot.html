                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that every time we want to look for a map of our school or our class schedule we have to google it and go through multiple clicks. We want to reduce that process by having a source where a student can get all the essential school information in one click.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A message is sent to a user's phone number stating if they want to chat with the UCI bot. If so, the user replies and he/she is given a list of options where they can text what they want from those options. The bot returns the information(link, phone number, etc). The current available options are a map of campus, class schedule, events, emergency phone numbers, and the academic calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Twilio to set up a chatbot and python to create the script.
We decided on using Twilio, since most students are proficient at texting. Instead of building a complicated app
or website, why not use a simple chatbot interface where all the user has to do is text what he/she wants to see!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twilio was daunting at first to understand. We have never worked with an API/system like Twilio, so it took us a while before we could start building our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we can finally build any product with Twilio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the best way to learn a new system is to look at their Documentation. Instead of wasting time on how to do something, it is more efficient to look at the Documentation since there is a high chance the answer may be there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Campus_Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the moment Campus_Bot only works with UC Irvine. The goal is to continue expanding to different campuses and make it easier for students to get all the information they need!
