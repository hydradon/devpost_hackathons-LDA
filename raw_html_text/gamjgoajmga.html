                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our objective was to integrate the Fitbit watch to help victims of natural disasters be located in high risk areas. To take it a step further we added a feature utilizing the Fitbit's sensors to track a person's vitals to help search and rescue responders locate more add risk victims in critical conditions based on logs of their vitals.

                        Tracks and logs vitals.

                        Ranks status (non-critical, critical) of victims based on their fitbit data metrics.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html, css, google maps api, and fitbit sdk.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had issues running fitbit sdk and was unable to integrate for demo. Ran into numerous bugs in loading index file to local server.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built a prototype that works (despite the fact that the data is pseudo data).

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    git, html, css, google cloud functions
                </p>

                    What's next for FIND
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to integrate Fitbit, and to be able to incorporate mobile so as to collect more pertinent location data that will allow first responders to track victims with more accuracy. The ability to incorporate mobile would allow us to track Fitbit users who are stuck in the homes in the event of an emergency. We also hope to eventually expand the customer base of FIND. The privacy of Fitbit users is one of our top priorities, and as of now only authorized government officials and emergency responders are planned to be permitted to access the Fitbit data. In the future, though, we will create an expansion of the FIND application that will be available to citizens. This sister application will allow friends and family members of a Fitbit user (and only them) to access the Fitbit data of the user. Before accessing FIND, said friends and family will have to receive authorization from the Fitbit user in question. The expansion is planned to allow family members to locate one another in case they get separated.
