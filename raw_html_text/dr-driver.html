                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by utilizing Dialogflow and the Google Cloud Platform. Dialogflow was used to store in all the intents and entities, where different properties of the incident such as the vehicle brand to the color of vehicle. We used the Google Cloud Platforms to make use of the Cloud Natural Language API. We also integrated it with Trillio, to make the phone call to highway patrol.

                <p>
                    We initially used entities to look for location info. This would require us to manually enter all interstates and all of their exits. We then solved the problem by using data from the Google Maps API.

                <p>
                    We learned how to create a google assistant action by utilizing Dialogflow to develop our project. Furthermore through the test phrase segment of our entities, we also learned the magnitude of how important it is to have a variety of Test Phrases in our Action.
