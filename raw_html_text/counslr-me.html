                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from all the people who do not have access to mental health resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app allows people to communicate in real time with professionals from everywhere in the world!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using node.js as the back-end and angularjs as the front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges when trying to implement the chatrooms and when we were making the process for registering to the web app separate for counsellors and users,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we could implement all the features we wanted in our app even though we didn't have too much prior knowledge. We also managed to keep the UI clean and simple to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use various modules and how to make chatrooms for apps.

                <p>
                    Counsl.me will soon be safe enough for every user to use anonymously and if the need arises can visit the closest counsellor, all with the click of a button
