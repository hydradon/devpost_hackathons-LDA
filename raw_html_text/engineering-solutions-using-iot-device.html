                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started from sensors we had (temperature and light sensor) and brainstormed possible scenarios of their application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Light sensors measure ambient lighing condition and send signal to turn on street lights when the readings are lower than a certain value.
Temperature sensors obtain temperature data and keep delicate control during pasteurization and ensure eggs are not cooked.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up our sensors and IoT device according to online instructions. Then we develop Node Red Application online and simulated with randomly generated data. Finally we integrate collected data into our web apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up hardware and getting reliable readings are the biggest challenges. We collaborated with Lane, the engineer from Helium, over the issue and finally resolve the issue.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The learning process for hardware and IoT concept from 0 to 1 within 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ask questions and lok for help when things does not work out.
