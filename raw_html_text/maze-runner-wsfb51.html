                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the randomness of the project idea where the mazes that are generated are constantly new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This minigame basically consists of a square player who is trying to run away from the computer controlled enemy square. The computer moves towards the square player using the A* algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used mainly javascript and HTML canvas as the rendering engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we were going to create a 3D version of the game with the Oculus Rift for "increased" immersiveness but we realized that it was incredibly difficult to set up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we managed to create a "minimum" viable product in our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's useful to prepare software and large data components beforehand as the internet is incredibly slow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Maze Runner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better UI elements, smoother gameplay, endless mazes.
                </p>
