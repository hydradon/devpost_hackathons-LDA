                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took inspiration from the RPG game of D&amp;D for our character creation and enemies. Coupled with a simple combat it makes for a fun game. It's currently in a 1 level demo state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game runs in the terminal with the character represented by the * character. The WASD keys move the character around the screen and the I key displays the inventory of the character.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a collaborative real-time text editor, Atom, which is owned by Github and our C compiler from CECS130. Our group chose to use C because this was a language we all knew and could collaborate with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several challenges. 1: Reading in a 2D array of characters to serve as the map of the area. 2: The combat system took several iterations to perfect even with its simplicity. We introduced a lot of moving parts with multiple different enemies and combat actions for the player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the display and the ease of access for moving the character around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to learn how to just take input from a keypress without using a buffer delay as with the scanf function. I also learned collaboration and the importance of fully developing a production plan to reduce the amount of debugging when implementing several different people's codes together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dungeon World
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next is to expand Dragon World to its full 5 level idea and further the input to perhaps run through AWS and interface with Facebook Messenger or SMS to run a version of the game.
