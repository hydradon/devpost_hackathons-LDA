                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To enhance the livelihood of artists and musicians through the use of technology. "Ars mea" is "my art" in Latin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arsmea allows artists to take photos of their artwork and upload it to an online database. The app provides a way for potential buyers to browse different pieces of art, and see what it would look like on their wall, and buy the piece.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Swift's ARKit. Most of the app is done programmatically, but interface builder was a useful tool in creating the initial start up flow of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Artsmea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we will expand Arsmea to take on machine learning capabilities- specifically, matching up buyers to artwork based on the color scheme of the room they intend to put the piece in, as well as styles that they have previously shown preference to. We will also incorporate sculptures into the Arsmea catalogue, and use newfound 3-D AR scanning technology to allow sculpture artists to sell their artwork on the app.
