                <p>
                    Acts of misogyny and microaggressions in the workplace happen all too often. We wanted to provide women with the tools and confidence to deal with these uncomfortable situations in a safe, virtual space.

                <p>
                    CALL OUT is a website that will allow users to practice responding to misogynistic microaggressions through incentivize repeated practice with &ldquo;Bravery Points&rdquo; that can grow your virtual wellness garden.

                <p>
                    During the testing phase, we asked fellow women at HackXX to test our product and provide us feedback. The suggestions included:
Ask men to use the product
Give generic answer suggestions to get further into the scenario
Equalize the sound on videos
Add more pictures
Add more links to external resources
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now all three of our team members have experience in web development! We made amazing connections with other likeminded women at this hackathon and were honored to share our idea and prototype with everyone. We are thankful for all the feedback and words of encouragement we gained.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to apply systems engineering to a web development project, how to utilize Bootstrap and override certain elements for a unique website written from scratch using a simple online editor, pencode.io.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to include more scenarios and to make the scenarios more robust with different outcomes based on user response. We also would like to implement the Bravery Points incentive feature and the virtual wellness garden to maintain user engagement.
