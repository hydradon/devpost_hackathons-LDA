                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tasked to create a new site for the Happy Hookah business with a very short amount of time before the deadline. The process was arduous, but we persevered and created the skeleton of a (semi) functional site!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has lots of helpful information about a local business here in Atlanta. You can find all the important details about Happy Hookah on this site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Atom.io and lots of patience. It was an entirely new experience for all of us and on such a short frame of time to build the website, it was a fast-paced adventure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The timeframe was definitely constricting and prevented us from finishing the project to match our standards. However, with very little experience between all of us, what we accomplished is satisfactory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering the severe lack of experience we all have, it is an accomplishment we have a site at all. The programming was tough, but the team-bonding we experienced is truly irreplaceable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a considerable amount of html coding and the Atom.io text editor. We learned to work as a team and find alternative solutions to seemingly impossible problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Happy Hookah New Website
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to refine the site to a point where it is acceptable to publish online for the Happy Hookah business.
