                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are non-CS related engineering majors who wanted to tackle a challenge that also implemented skills we learned in our own intro engineering classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads a .csv file containing step count, mood, calories burned, hours of sleep, feeling of activity, and weight of one person over the course of 96 days.
It gives the user the option to compare more than 2 data types, to view the graphical representation of 1 data type, or view the statistical analysis of 1 data type.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Matlab, an open-source dataset of a health tracker, and our brains :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn how to read in .csv files and properly store each data type.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What are we proud of?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After three hours of research and trial and error we got the first line of code to work! After that it was smooth sailing and learning more Matlab and programming in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Data Analysis of Health Tracking Data
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were to do this again, we will transfer the Matlab code/logic into Javascript and HTML because they are more commonly used.
