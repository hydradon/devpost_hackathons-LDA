                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I go to gym a lot and log all my workout in the log book. It's very time consuming and I can't really easily figure out whether I been improving using the paper log book that's why we build Gymatic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using your Apple Watch watchOS3 we can automatically identify the exercise you did, count the rep for you and save the data in OpenShift. Gymatic will also contribute to the activity rings on Apple watch taking credit of your gym workout. Being able to see my gym log will help me improve my health by motivating me to go to the gym more.
