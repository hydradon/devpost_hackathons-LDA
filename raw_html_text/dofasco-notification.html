                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dofasco needed a webapp to check the status of their incidents and the severity of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our webapp allows dofasco to view incidents, and sort them based off date and severity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a template using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then used Django to populate the site with data from Dofasco's API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn to use Django, and additionally had to make assumptions about Dofasco's systems, such as what represented the different levels of severity were.  We also ran into problems with AWS where we were unable to make an account, and issues with domain.com where we couldn't ftp to it.
