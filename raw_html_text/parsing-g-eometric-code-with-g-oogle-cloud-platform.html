                    A common fear among new makers is causing harm to their equipment or themselves. This is not unfounded, given the true potential of improper use of heated, sharp, and electrical elements to be destructive. However, holding on to this fear is detrimental to a hobbyist or professional's development, and inhibits the cultivation of an independent, creative spirit.

                    This project aims to de-mystify how some of the most common machines in makerspaces, 3D printers and CNC machines, process and execute commands. The goal is a human-readable step-by-step explanation, available to a maker at all times, for any 3D file that they wish to double check before starting their project.

                    By working to eliminate the hesitation of starting the materializing process, this program will encourage the creative process and help in bringing the benefits to local individuals, communities, and society that will follow.

                    This program will search for G(eometric) and M(iscellaneous) code commands and 'translate' them into simpler written English for the user. In addition, it will find and preserve any comments that were within the file for readability, so as to avoid inadvertently providing a result less understandable.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Google Cloud Platform's Auto Machine Learning Natural Language API and training guides.
The G-Code I used were generated from 3D models from Thingiverse (specific models and authors linked) with Ultimaker Cura 4.3.0.
