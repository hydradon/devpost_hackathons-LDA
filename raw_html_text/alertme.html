                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the wake of recent school shootings, we developed an app that allows students to notify others if they sense suspicious behavior.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AlertMe! introduces an application that allows users to quickly report a school safety issue including school shootings, drugs, weapons, bomb threats, and fights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using MIT App Inventor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into was the type of platform/software we wanted to use for this app. Also, we had trouble setting up notifications if any suspicious behavior was received.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of accomplishing an app that has a potential to save lives and increase student safety throughout the country.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use MIT App Inventor as well as various teamwork and problem solving skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AlertMe!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to make AlertMe! available for IOS users in addition to Android users. We would also like to create push notifications for suspicious behavior within a 5 mile radius and create school and student profiles that can be used to increase the safety of students.
