                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make a smart system which can predict what kind of crime can happen in any particular area on the particular time period. To help police in preventing crime from happening and for normal people to live safely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It predicts the crime that may happen in a particular area at a particular amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used machine learning algorithms to make a crime prediction system for Urbana Champaign. For machine learning modeling we used R programming and from development purpose, we used Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a good amount of stuff in this small period. And if we able to complete this project this may bring impact for society and especially for people of champaign.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning was the best part of this event. We learned so many things from scratch in this small amount of period. Apart from technical stuff we learned about team management too.
                </p>

                    What's next for iCrimePredictor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make it a stand-alone prediction system and give this to the Champaign police department. and also release this for free so normal people. can use this
