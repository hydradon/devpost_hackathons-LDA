                            About 75 million American adults (32%) have a chronic condition such as high blood pressure&mdash;that&rsquo;s 1 in every 3 adults

                            Having high blood pressure puts you at risk for&nbsp;heart disease&nbsp;and&nbsp;stroke, which are leading causes of death in the United States.

                    Gl&uuml; is an ENGAGING Family-Social Health Management &amp; Maintenance Platform
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With all the technologies available to us and the prevalence of IoT devices Gl&uuml; promises to enable real-time management of chronic conditions and medication adherence for families. For our solution we wrote a cloud back end in C# and also used Ring Central's API to sms and voice call to track  medication usage for our proof of concept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future we will be integrating the Glip API and framework to make it easier for families as well as doctors to keep up with patients usage and habits.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest issue we faced was time management. We wanted to accomplish much more but were limited by our day to day availability. Also had some hard time translating and utilizing the Glip API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were successful in generating app mockups and designs that will go a long way when we fully build out our app. We also have really bonded as team in regards to the idea and it's potential to impact lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RingCentral has some potentially powerful API's we can leverage as we continue to build out Glu.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to integrate with other smart devices and continue to explore unconventional UI's like text and voice further.
