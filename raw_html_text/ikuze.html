                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hate office, especially office politics, therefore we create a game to mock at it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You climb on a higher position by taking on your boss, pull him/her/it down and sit on his/her/its seat
It is a erc721 token which represent you, the token will be your avatar, to train in different departments, to fight on different battle ground.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we use remix ide and we implement erc721, to build the base of the game, we tried to use bitski SDK to create our UI(failed tho, truffle is really unfriendly towards window user)
