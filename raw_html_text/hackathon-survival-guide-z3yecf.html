                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've been to a bunch of hackathons, and every time we see the same picture: students struggling to complete projects while combating stress, hunger, sleep deprivation, and feeling like they are not good enough to be here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone promotes hackathons as fun, creative experiences, and they certainly are - but that's just one side of the coin. The other side is a dark one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game about a girl at a hackathon. You can move using the arrow keys, and interact with objects by pressing X. The goal is to get your hackathon project done, but you have to keep in mind the constantly rising stress levels!
                    <br>
                    Moreover, there are random events throughout the game, because life is unpredictable, and you never know what's gonna happen!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    HOW TO TRY IT OUT:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you are using the link provided (hosted on github), BE AWARE that your browser may be blocking some "unsafe" scripts and not loading the game. Just allow the scripts to be loaded, I promise we are not trying to break into your computer, we are not at that level yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript+JQuery, HTML, CSS, and lots and lots of googling
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first web-based game, and we run into a lot of issues with setting it up in the beginning.
                    <br>
                    Moreover, we had only two people on the team, and each one of us had to do a little bit of everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a FINISHED PRODUCT in 24 hours with only two people! And not just a product, but a GAME! Games take so much time! Woo!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to build web-based games.
                    <br>
                    JQuery + HTML + CSS + JavaScript = A MESS
                    <br>
                    We are still bad at organizing our group work, but we are getting better!
                    <br>
                    Having lots of .js files can get confusing, especially if you have a lot of coupling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hackathon Survival Guide
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is always room for improvement! Next steps would be expanding the map, adding more interactions and making the game more complex, and adding more animations because everyone likes animations!
