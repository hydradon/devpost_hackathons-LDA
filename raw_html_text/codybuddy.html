                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wanted to work on a project but did not have any idea how to start? Have you ever wanted to learn new stuffs but got confused with the options available? Do you have a project idea but not enough resources to complete it? Do you want to take the lead on a project and create your own team to work on it? Don't worry, we have all been there. They are the common phases most CS students go through. Many computer science students, specially freshmen and sophomores, face the challenge to start working on side projects because they have never had any experience outside of the class assignments or labs. Most of the CS juniors and seniors, have a project idea in mind, but not enough contributors to complete it. Some of them want to lead their own group and work on their own idea. So, we built this web application which would solve this problem. Our web application enables students to search, sort and post project ideas online, connect with potential coders and collaborate with them to build something cool.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application opens up to the page where projects posted by users are listed with their necessary information (title, category, languages, frameworks) in a user friendly interface with the functionality to search and sort according to the user's need. Viewers can create their own profile to inquire about possible collaboration. Project owners get notified when a user asks to collaborate with them in their project idea. Contact information is shared among the users when one asks to collaborate with them.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the server on Node.js using Express framework. The front-end was developed using pug, bootstrap, css, javascript and jQuery.

                    Developing a user-friendly interface.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a full fledged working web-application from scratch.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Bootstrap and CSS.

                    What's next for CodeBuddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to authenticate user login. We want to enhance the search functionality significantly by using data aggregation, to deploy a chat server where users can chat with each other and in groups.
