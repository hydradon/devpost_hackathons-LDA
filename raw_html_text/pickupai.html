                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Azure AI APIs (Voice verification and bing voice to word). Then we use Django to create a web interface to allow the submission of audio files. If we had more time, we would implement twilio api to perform the commands over the phone.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using microsoft azure and using an AI api. So our inexperience with the programs we working with were the biggest hurdles we had to overcome.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team,we were able to pull it together. Many of us felt like leaving and quitting but we stayed till the end and pushed beyond our limits. We've learned a lot from this experience and we're looking to further explore the vast field of AI.
