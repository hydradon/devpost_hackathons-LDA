                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When going out, we realized that it costs a lot of money to buy food outside. Searching for cheap restaurants can be a time-consuming task, and thus we wanted to simplify it. Thus, we decided to create a web application that makes your life easy!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a user inputs a location and their budget, at a click of a button, the web-app recommends three restaurants that based on the location and your budget. We make sure that the three restaurants will not go over your budget because, at the aim, we try to help you to save money in a convenient way!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web application was built using mainly Flask and Python for the back-end, and HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Front-End. We requested API calls from Google Geocode and Zomato to return three restaurants and created our own algorithm to return three restaurants under or equal to your budget. After that, we also used the Google Maps API to show the location visually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we initially ran into was getting the API to actually work. Figuring out we can get specific data from the API took time as we were new into developing web-apps.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of what we created because, in the end, we were able to finalize our product and make it deployable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use multiple APIs and take it to our advantage, and also connect back-end and front-end together to make a web-app that actually works. We also learned team project-development skills to improve our efficiency.
