                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we came to hackNY, our group had no idea what we wanted to build. That was until the sponsors pitched their APIs and suddenly it all clicked together. We live in an age revolving around instant gratification: UberEats and Amazon's same-day shipping. We wanted to take it to another level by designing an application that allows you to satisfy your food cravings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    idCrave is an application that allows the user to upload images of food, analyzes the picture to determine what kind of food is in the picture, and recommends a list of restaurants where the user can buy that food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Clarifai's API, the application identifies the food in the image.  Then, it takes that content and inputs into Foursquare's API to return a list of restaurants, listed in order of the closest proximity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we wanted to build an iOS application that would allow users to simply take a picture. However, because none of our members had experience developing apps, we decided to build a website instead. We split up the tasks into front-end and back-end. Unfortunately, we were not able to link the two together successfully, so we were just left with a functioning program at the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were happy to learn and utilize the clarifai and foursquare APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For all of us, this was our first hackathon, which is a scary prospect for anyone. However, just by showing up, we were able to learn so much. We were able to learn the power of APIs and implement two that really interested us. Although there were many ups and downs, we knew that as long as we worked as a team, we could overcome any struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for idCrave
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because our original goal was to create a mobile application, we want to continue working on this and deploy it for iOS. Even though this means learning Swift, we are all excited to do so. The main feature of the app would be to simply snap a picture of any food on the go and recommend nearby locations for that particular food.
