                    Solar Explorer is a Oculus Rift educational tool which enables students to view the positions of the solar system's objects both in real-time, and at any time between 3000BC and 3000AD.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It utilises a range of cutting-edge visual technologies including Oculus Rift, VR-Boilerplate, and Three.JS alongside data from Skyfield to create a fully 3D environment containing orbits and information about each planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We developed this in 36 hours, as part of Manchester Spring GreatUniHack 2016.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We firstly found an appropriate API, to get the positions of planets for a given time. From this we parsed the data into a JSON format. Using this data structure, we passed it into a WebGL instance to provide the arguments for creating accurately sized planets, and used various mesh technologies to overlay maps of the planets onto the spheres.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our API's for mobile Virtual Reality, BoilerPlate-VR, was partially incomplete and lacked several key function calls which required significant workarounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, no-one in our group had large amounts of experience with Javascript; which we used as a key component of our program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the final hours, a Git merge caused us to lose significant parts of our code-base.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are proud of our progress and the workflow manner we adopted was efficient.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt large amounts of Javascript syntax, as well as Node.JS backend and how to use JSON to parse data in a clean and fast manner.

                    We aim now to recover our lost work, and develop the application further.
