                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are approximately 200 million babies born per year.  However, around 1 million babies die from lack of attention.
The mortality rate of accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed (ASSB) started to increase in the beginning of 1998 and had reached the highest rate at 20.8 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013.
Approximately 52% of parents in predominantly Asian countries, had reported that their children has had a sleep problem.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Baby Safe is your personal baby care assistant, an app to keep track of your baby health as well as to prevent accidental death of YOUR baby. All whilst using the thermal camera to monitor your baby without the need of being there yourself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used FlirOne iOS SDK to fetch thermal heat images and used image processing algorithm to accomplish our features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with a lot of ideas, and had a hard time choosing which one to spear head towards to. But later we decided to go for the one that had the most social commercial impact. Another challenge we ran into was figuring out how to implement the computer visual algorithm and hooking it up with the FLIR One SDK in a very short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The face coverage detection is the essential feature of the app and we are so excited that it works fantastically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop the software in a short amount of time. Pitching is also a valuable technique we learnt from this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Baby Safe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next stage for Baby Safe will be implementing the analysis of the temperature track record history. By focusing on the thermal camera technology, what else we can do push further in order to give the Baby Safe an all round product analysis?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multiple devices with communication is also needed. We would need to implement the quality of video streaming between the devices, so that family members or an organisation (like hospitals) can access the thermal camera seamlessly.
