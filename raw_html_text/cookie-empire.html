                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My goal was to produce a highly engaging
                    <strong>
                        #VoiceFirst
                    </strong>
                    game which Alexa users love to play, supplemented with a visual component!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except for a few notable exceptions, most of the Alexa games I've played are pretty bad and I quickly get bored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a game which sucks you in but remains simple to play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by clicker games such as cookie clicker. They provide highly engaging and addictive game mechanics based on simple inputs. They fitted perfectly into what I wanted to build.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cookie Empire lets you bake cookies. A lot of cookies!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, the more cookies you bake, the higher your net cookie worth is and the bigger your empire will be!
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's easy to bake cookies...just say "bake".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, the journey to a global cookie empire is not so simple. It will take time and dedication. Something I like to refer to as....cookiecation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is hand coded using the ASK NodeJS v2 SDK with AWS DynamoDB for data storage and AWS Lambda as the skill back-end.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time using and experimenting with APL. It has a steep learning curve but once you have gotten used to the logic, syntax and it's quirks, it's pretty fun to use and a powerful way to add a visual component to your skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a fast-paced engaging game which will hopefully have users coming back for more cookie goodness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa Presentation Language (APL). It was my first time.
I will now be using APL for all my future skills.

                <p>
                    Tweaks based on user data. More levels. Upgrades. Maintenance. Maybe in-skill purchasing.
