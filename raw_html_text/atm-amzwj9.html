                    Inspiration I come from the country where you hardly see a ATM machine 10 years ago. the curiosity of first time to use ATM has always made me to built similar to that. today i try to inspire myself with my childhood curiosity.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i used the programming language as python. currently i am studying python in college. so python programming helped me to create a simple ATM.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did the paper-prototype at first. than i gather all the programming syntax and worked step by step.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    getting all the values right, finding out the mathematical expressions without coding into vast terms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    after six hours of coding and errors, finally made it through the final output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i learn to interact with other member when my command prompt was not working, exchange of information from other programmer. it was a very useful place to learn to code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for atm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    next i am thinking to turn into GUI and launch the various options like bank help support, issuing extra card or creating more accounts and  credit accounts. there is plenty of room to be updated
