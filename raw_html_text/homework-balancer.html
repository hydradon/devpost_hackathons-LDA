                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of many ideas, but one thing which we all had in common was a heavy workload from school. Through this, we decided to create this application and interface for a collaborative network of teachers. By interacting with each other, both teachers and students would benefit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a teacher goes to the website, they are directed to a login/signup button. Then, they will be introduced to a page which shows the amount of homework the other teachers have given. It will show the total time of work from all four core classes (Math, English, Science, and History).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Flask web framework for creating the web server and serving dynamic web pages. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the websites UI and functionality.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully created the UI of the website, as well as the login page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned back-end terminology and concepts and full-stack web development. We also learned how to design web pages to interact with the server using ways such as the POST method with HTTP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Homework Balancer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to create an iOS or Android app and improve the UI. We also want to add some more features such as real-time syncing as well as an instant messaging box for teachers.
