                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent so much amount on our computers. Many a time it feels like we have been working for so long but things are not getting done. The biggest reason of this is those "tiny breaks" on the Social Media, that funny meme, that recreational video. It all adds up to waste a lot more time than we expect and affects our efficiency manyfold.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our chrome extension maintains a timer for Facebook, Netflix, Youtube and WhatsApp on the web for an entire day. After every time one of these tabs is opened or is activated, it reports the time you have spent in the day on these websites. It does reset the timer as the date changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javaScript to build the extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The three of us had never worked on javaScript before. This was a challenging experience. The asynchronous nature if JS and the callback functions all make it interesting to understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the extension work perfectly to the logic we developed!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>

                    JavaScript

                    What's next for Watch your time
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will come up with a pretty UI to really make you think about the time spent online (Also since not all of us want the console screen open all the time :D)
The user would have the ability to feed in the websites that he wants to track. 
Time data can be stored in a cloud that can allow us to generate a weekly or monthly report for the user.
