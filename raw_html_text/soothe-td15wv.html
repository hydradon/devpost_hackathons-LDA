                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being high school students, we understand what it is like to struggle with our mental health, and we understand just as much that youth and adults often aren&rsquo;t given the proper support systems as well as comfort to feel good in our own skin. Oftentimes, high school students give cries out for help but were never. We wanted to create S.O.O.T.H.E so that no youth or adult feels that they are alone and they would be able to use our website to destress in a healthy manner. We want our users to approach their issues with care and the idea that they matter. Although the first thought in mind was high school focused, our platform is friendly to all users and allows for a feeling of acceptance and calm within itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soothe is supposed to act as a web page/webapp that gives you a break and alleviates whatever problems you feel are going on in your life. Anything from college admissions, tests, home life, or just feeling down can be lessened through browsing our page. We have included a live twitter feed which acts as a daily motivator. We can broadcast anything from motivational quotes, sharing community stories, or even a hello every once in a while. We also were able to input a spotify playlist on our page that could be changed daily/weekly in order to suggest music to help you relax and rejuvenate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Html, CSS, and Javascript in order to achieve our project in less than 36 hrs. We all worked both collectively at times and also individualized certain tasks in order to get to where we are now. We were also able to use Twitter and Spotify API&rsquo;s in order to improve UX and overall aesthetic. By allowing our team to diversify our knowledge in certain areas we were able to complete tasks at more rapid paces and as a collective, bouncing ideas off of one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building this website was a very long process, we encountered many challenges. We created a logo which we had a difficulty displaying it on the web page/webapp. Simple things like changing the background color would ruin our entire code. As beginners it was a great experience and we learned a lot of trial and error trying to figure things out. We had to find specific lines of codes through many different websites and tutorials. So many trials and error. Finding a host for our website was another challenge, we searched for various types of host websites that could possibly get our webpage to be live. Our domain also never areived in our email fast enough to deploy it into our website. In the end all these big and small challenges were surpassed by working together and reaching our goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest accomplishment would be that we were able to get out website running, we were able to find a host, and best of all had fun doing it. From realizing we had no idea how to fully use a virtual environment in terminal to just trying to get everyone on slack to share files, our stress was filled with laugher. Being in an environment where we were surrounded by beginners like us was very calming. We weren&rsquo;t as nervous or stressed knowing other people were going through the same troubles we had. Our team celebrated our functioning live twitter feed and very much enjoyed the soothing music on our home page. We were lucky enough to get to talk to other empowering females like ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about both ourselves and our teammates at Tech Together. We came in as a group of 4 friends and were given the opportunity to add another member to our team! Despite the fact that we lived in a different state than our new team member we were able to connect through the activities, keynotes, and hacking! We were able to improve on our extremely limited skills and get a sense of the world of coding. Not only that, we were also surrounded by females who fit the description of a boss! We believe that Soothe stands for something we all wish to gain and struggle to achieve everyday. Through that, we have learned to take time to regroup during times of exhaustion and stress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Soothe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we would do next for Soothe is improve the UX to make it even more of a de-stressor. Our biggest improvement would be to make an actual app where you can join chat rooms and vent about whatever is troubling you at the time and gain a sense of community that you may be seeking all at the palm of your hands. We would also have a daily activity such as a game, puzzle, or writing session that could allow you about 5 minutes of personal time, which is crucial to improving one&rsquo;s mental wellbeing. We believe that Soothe stands for something we all wish to gain and struggle to achieve everyday.
