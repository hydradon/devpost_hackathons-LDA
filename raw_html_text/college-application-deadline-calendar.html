                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Strived to automate the process of creating a calendar for college application deadlines. This resource was not available to us and we still could not find one online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we want it to do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User opens the Google Form, selects which colleges they are applying to, selects which deadline they choose, and sends email invites to user to add deadlines/events to calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used UiPath to populate Google Sheets of all the colleges and their deadlines. We used Apps Script to create a Google Form with the data from the sheets and to send a calendar invite.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulty populating the Google Sheets with UiPath and ran out of time to scale the form.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went out of our comfort zones and explored new tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned about UiPath and other ways to populate Google Sheets through web scraping. We also learned to be mindful about scaling.
                </p>

                    Including open house events that the user can select by location and date.
