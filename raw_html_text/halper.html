                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't like writing long essays, so I tried to make a program that would automatically make my essay seem longer without me actually writing more stuff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It (should) replace all the periods in the essay to size 14. This means that there is more space between periods, and a seemingly longer essay
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used html and javascript to program my program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I couldn't find a way to replace all the periods in the essay, so I made another "feature."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I successfully installed a script that imported a text-editor box on my website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that html is harder than it looks.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll try and make the periods actually work.
