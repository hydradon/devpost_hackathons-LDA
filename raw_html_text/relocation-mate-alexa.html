                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all almost graduates that are looking to relocate in the next few months. We all lived in questionable neighbourhoods before. We though it would be useful to have an interface that can show you the best neighbourhoods and their listings given criteria such as crime rates or the employment rate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Relocation Mate offers you the right information about postcodes and it also makes suggestions on a larger postcode area you can move to based the criteria you input.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Relocation Mate preprocesses open government data about Population, Deprivation Indexes etc in order to create meaningful information. After the data is preprocessed, it can be queried over criteria using a weighted sum model and analytic hierarchical process. An API is created using Feathers.js that is used by an Alexa Skill.
