                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make a game which helps players learn what you do at a cornhacks event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a text-based game which offers several choices depending on the actual schedule plus a few interesting embellishments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C++ to program the code and had a team of writers for the majority of options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to coordinate work on the specifically, so we were limited to one computer doing coding at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of how easy it is to add decisions and expand the storyline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was refreshed on how to use pointers in C++, learned how to do structs in that language and also various ways to pass arguments and get data outside of the specific C++ language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Genuine Cornhacks Experience
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be presenting today and there is a potential random number generator we will add for the program.
