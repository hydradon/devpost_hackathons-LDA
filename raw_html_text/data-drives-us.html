                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the wake of recent events, we feel that the community as a whole needs to be more conscious of the data that any site can get with just a
                    <strong>
                        few lines of code
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our site shows the data that users unknowingly share with every website they visit. All of this information is presented through the browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the backend using Node + Express, hosted it on the AppEngine from the Google Cloud Platform, and the front end is built with Handlebars and SCSS. Data is retrieved from the user with vanilla JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Partway through building our project, we realized that the client information we were grabbing was not actually from the client - it was from the server. We had to redo all of the scripts associated with that part of the project and abandon 2 critical npm packages. Another issue we had was setting up GCP and configuring our DNS to use a custom domain name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how well we adapted to issues on the fly and our ability to learn new platforms quickly (none of us are front-end developers and we haven't hosted on a cloud service before).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to be more mindful of what we are doing on the backend and what we are doing on the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Data Drives Us
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to revamp the website's landing page and we plan to add some of the features we originally had to table due to time constraints.
