                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On our way driving to defHacks() NY, we chanced upon the wondrous sight of a police car stopped on the side of the road. Suddenly, an idea flew into our minds like a bird into its nest. We then embraced such clarity as to our purpose for the next thirty hours and settled upon the idea of helping to save the world... through law enforcement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By synthesizing the Google Maps API and the native Android GPS sensors, we created a system through which the locations of emergency personnel are tracked in order to facilitate rapid response to emergencies. After an emergency is reported to a police station, a dispatch agent immediately enters the caller's location into the app and sends the information to either a police officer, firemen, or ambulance. The information is sent to specific individuals of emergency personnel based on their location relative to the caller's location. When the emergency personnel receives the information to attend to the caller, he or she can choose to accept or deny the request. If he or she accepts the request, the location of the caller will be presented and a direct link to Google Maps navigation for that location is provided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to design and program the app. The Google Maps API was used to calculate distances between locations. We used the Firebase Cloud Messaging service to allow for communication between devices.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Lots and lots of roadblocks and traffic cones. (Bugs, bugs, and bugs.)
