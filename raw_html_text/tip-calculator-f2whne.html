                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about the kinds of things applications are useful for and decided it was about time we started creating something useful but simple (at first). Hopefully this is the start of a series of inventive projects
                </p>

                    What it does

                    calculates tip on anything you want
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    used swift and xcode, lynda, youtube, and stack overflow
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    learning a whole new language. we were just learning on the fly the whole time, dealing with the caveats of debugging in a language we'd almost never been exposed to
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we're proud of our UI skills, considering this is our first attempt.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned how to use Xcode, patience with systems, and how to sit down and just work for hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tip Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we want to smoothen it out by rounding the digits a little better, getting rid of leading zeros, and perhaps including a round to nearest dollar button.
