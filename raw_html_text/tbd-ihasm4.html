                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People are suffering from homelessness and other related issues. Information on aid services is scattered all over the internet. Homeless people need one easy and effective way to find all the aid services they need in one place. And service providers need to be on the same page so that they can more easily aid people in need. For that we though of "TBD".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project streamlines information on aid services into one web application. It allows homeless shelters to connect with each other and aid organizations. This way, people seeking aid with those organizations can find the right shelters and services that they need in the quickest way possible. It allows shelters to input, store, edit, and retrieve their data such as intake forms and occupant records for their own personal use, and actively keeps track of shelters in the area, their capacities, demographics, the services they provide, their locations, and other useful information. This information is made available to aid organizations in the area to make sure that persons seeking aid can find the right place every time.
