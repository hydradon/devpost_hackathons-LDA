                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Biomedical devices like brain epilepsy detectors, heart monitoring system, that are implanted within the body face the major issue of size and power consumption,which should be as small a figure as possible. Hence computationally intesive work like analog processing and digital signal processing, should be routed to virtual processors outside the body, which implement the required logic on-demand, process the sent inputs, and relay the processed output back to requester device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This system is not in a fully working condition, but however has immense potential to even reduce the amount of silicon chips that is circulated in the world, with every device querying for processing, allocate resources remotely, compute the inputs and send it to output devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We conceptualized this using the XILINX pynq board, board itself being under development, having customizable ARM -FPGA fabric that enables one to implement custom logic of choice on the go. We used XBEE modules to send data wirelessly from a requester, to another XBEE module interfaced to PYNQ board
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing software for the multiprocessor evironment requires working extensively with shared memory concept, needing programming partially in Python, and partially in C , to get the required logic implemented. It took us more time to understand the architecture from scratch ground up, and figure out ways to implement our solution.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stepping outside our comfort zone ! Doing something really challenging, taking the risk of working with a completely new , and potentially amazing hardware board, as opposed to working with our familiarities, that are less capable than this board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 days are just not enough to tap the potential of this amazing processing system, now that we know that there is a board like this around in the market, we can continue working further to develop the final working prototype of our project.

                    What's next for Virtual biomedical computing systems
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ohhh! What is one aspect of this world that is truly unexplored from a computational point of view? It's the human body! . Biomedical implants for brain, heart, muscles etc,. performing wide variety of monitoring and electrical stimulation to terminate any diseases, are the call of hour, and for something to go inside the body, should be as small and least power consuming as possible. This needs virtualization, and fast-tracked development to proceed further in biomedical engineering
