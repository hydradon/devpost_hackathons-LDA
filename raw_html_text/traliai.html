                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe in using technology to make the world a safer place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TraLi AI is a faster R-CNN developed to recognize and classify traffic lights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a faster R-CNN implementation and built upon it, training the network on the Small Bosch Traffic Light Dataset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The implementation of the network and using the Bosch Dataset for training purposes. Computing resources and internet connectivity also proved to be very troublesome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unwillingness to give up and a joint team effort to achieve the best in a very limited time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to actually implement a CNN, fine tune it and adjust it to work with the given dataset as part of the challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TraLiAI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Change the world...by further optimizing and improving the network.
