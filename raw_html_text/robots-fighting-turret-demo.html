                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AI integration into robots was our main inspiration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Makes two turret-based robots fight each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project through using Arduino and servo motors and we manipulated them with the Arduino IDE. There is also a computer interface included to be able to control the bots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning of the hackathon our plan was to integrate an Alexa with a Raspberry Pi and have it control robots, but through much trial and error there was no luck in connecting the Alexa and Raspberry Pi. The main issue here was the internet connections. Connecting through ports over a mobile hotspot on one's phone is not possible in the global scale, and the internet provided by the school has a firewall that prevents global ports, and port forwarding in general. With this in our way, and a lot of time spent into trying to implement this idea, we scrapped it and focused on the robotic component.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about throughout the entire event, which was probably a huge accomplishment. Another accomplishment was figuring out the problem with connecting the Alexa to the Raspberry Pi in this environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the things we learned was the endless troubleshooting that goes through making programs work, along with learning about different tools. Another was how to google our problems for solutions. The major thing we learned was in time management and working in a team efficiently.
