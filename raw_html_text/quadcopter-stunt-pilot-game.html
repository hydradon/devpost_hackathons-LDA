                    My inspiration for the project is that I was tired of flying my micro and nano quadcopters around the house and terrorizing the cats. I wanted something fun to do. I started by landing them on a square of cardboard. I tried to see how many times I could land on it. Then I wondered how many flips I could do without crashing. After that it was how many combinations I could do. I thought this might be something that could be automated for scoring.

                <p>
                    Using any standard, micro, nano quadcopter that does flips. Standard sized quadcopter outside. Game is meant to be played indoors.

                    The concept is to have fun with you quadcopter. Get points for spins, flips, landings, combined stunts. 
This will be a proof of concept to see if a scoring platform is functional in an IoT environment.

                        The RPi is paired to the Bluetooth device on the quadcopter, the RPi analyzes the data, sends the results to the cloud, Smartphone/tablet app (or HTML5) displays the points. Score is tweeted at the end of the game.
