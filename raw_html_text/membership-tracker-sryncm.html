                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a board member for the Undergraduate Finance Association and we have issues signing in people into our events. The lines would be so long that the speaker would not be able to start until up to 15 minutes after the official start of the event. As a result, I wanted to create an application that would simplify the signing in process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application allows clubs and organizations of UCI to keep track of attendees. Through only the request of a student's UCI Net ID the application is able to scrape the UCI directory for the information that students would normally have to spend a couple minutes typing and instantly saves it to a database. That database can then be exported and stored into an excel file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest part was split between being able to learn how to use all these libraries that I have never used before and creating a working and somewhat pleasant UI. Python does not offer many great UI/UX libraries and I could not get my python shell to link to my electron application. In the end, I had to go with what I learned in ICS 32... good old tkinter.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud with the amount of time and effort I was able to put into this. I really loved working on this project and hope it helps a lot of people. I did not think I would be able to implement so many cool features in such a short amount of time as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot of new libraries and things I can do with having only taken the intro Python classes here at UCI. I learned that there is a plethora of libraries and APIs out there waiting to be used for the next innovation.

                <p>
                    I am looking to get clubs at our school to use and implement this application in their own clubs to prevent the atrocity that is long lines.
