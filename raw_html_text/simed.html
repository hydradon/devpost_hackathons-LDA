                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration stemmed from the classic question that many students to elderly concerning whether someone has Advil or Tylenol for their minimal aliment. The created various questions about determining which drug was the best over-the-counter medicine based upon the symptoms to how much a drug is safe to take based upon person biostatistics. Unlike prescription medicines, over-the-counter requires no prescription and no consultation about usage and dosage from a medical professional.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SiMed was created with the intention of designing a simplistic and easy to use application to aid in discerning knowledge about over-the-counter medications. Thus, the app&rsquo;s main three functions are
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Giving a dosage amount personalized to biostatistics
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A recommendation based upon current symptoms
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A notification system to aid people in remembering when they last took a dose and when it is safe to take the next one if necessary.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The dosage function uses conversion units recommended by various hospitals and pharmaceutical companies data and research to determine the personalized amount. And the recommendation function uses user input of current symptoms and algorithms rating each system to come to a conclusion of the best over-the-counter medication for their current state.  And finally, because a common issue is forgetting when medication was taken, over-the-counter drugs actually have a level of danger due to over usage of the medication. A notification system allows for a safe way to take medications in a timely manner by reminding and storing when a person has last taken the medication. 
The mobile application runs on both iOS and Android operating systems to allow for a larger consumer base.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built using the Ionic Framework with Cordova. The scripting was mostly in angularJS with a few implementations of SQLite for UI storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team member in charge of the back-end angular scripting was relatively new to coding and ended up working on almost the entire angularJS/html code for the app. The main issue was trying to get notifications to work for the app, but after some tweaking all of them work.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning html/angularJS/css/ionic in a night and the fact three Biomedical Engineers were able to create a mobile application from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the process of creating this mobile app, we have learned many things. The research we had to do on drugs was one the bigger tasks we had because we had to understand what the dosages were depending on the person who needs the drug. Different body types and ages will need different dosages rather than just the standard dosages listed on most boxes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SiMed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for SiMed would be to expand our databases as well as continue to improve our app to optimal conditions for determining and reflecting more of the real world.
