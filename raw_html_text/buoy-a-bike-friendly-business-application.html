                    Help realize a bike lane. Invest in your neighborhood. Support local business.

                    BUOY IS A SIGNAL OF A CHANGING TIDE, a growing swell for positive changes. 
BUOY SERVES AS A NAVIGATION MARKER for the direction we need to take. 
BUOY GIVES CAUSE TO BE CHEERFUL AND CONFIDENT that a community can come together to make a difference.

                    This concept seeks to empower citizens, cyclists, homeowners, and private-businesses to directly contribute to, and reap benefits from implementation of bike facilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A web-based application serves as a mechanism for identifying interest among individuals and businesses to invest in local bike infrastructure, and furthers prioritization and implementation based on value capture strategies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An interactive mapping tool allows web users to view the Oahu Bike Plan and to mark their particular interest in prioritizing designated bike routes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on a mapped location (where someone works or lives), projected measurable benefits resulting from the future construction of a planned bike route are graphically presented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A personalized potential return on investment is calculated based on derived benefits from increased property value and/or increased patronage from cyclists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An web user can decide to contribute according to a calculated assessed amount, relative to the collective shared contribution among neighbors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A contribution earns the funder notoriety and promotional value as a &ldquo;bike-friendly business&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cyclists can invite businesses to participate, and can leave reviews on linked sites like Yelp and Foursquare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As promised contributions begin to accumulate, peer pressure and popular support will work to encourage more potential beneficiaries to contribute and commit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a threshold total contributions have been made, the planned bike route will enter into &ldquo;funded&rdquo; phase ready for construction.
