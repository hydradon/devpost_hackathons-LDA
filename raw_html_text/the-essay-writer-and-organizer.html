                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Opening a Word Doc or Google Doc to write a new essay is daunting, and over time starts to induce anxiety for a lot of people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app to provide an alternative atmosphere for essay writing that also provides planning tools such as a place to organize sources and create research cards for them, as well as a compartmentalized outlining process. Everything is displayed on one convenient dashboard to make it easier to ease yourself into writing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ruby-on-Rails and deployed on Heroku. Gems used include Materialize CSS and Devise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was the biggest challenge. We weren't able to get it functioning properly in the time limit. We had difficulty in setting up postgresql on either of our local machines and had difficulty setting the domain. (Here's to hoping that's solved by the time we are done.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time at a hackathon, and neither of us are very experienced in web development, so while the project didn't work out as expected it was a try to be proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to set up devise, how to deploy an app, strengthened html skills.
                </p>
