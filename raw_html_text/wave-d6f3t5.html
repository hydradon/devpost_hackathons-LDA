                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought the Chirp concept was really cool and that it could be used with sound to "hide" messages and advertisement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It picks a spotify playlist and inserts chirps in between songs which can be picked up by the devices of people in the room/queue/line.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a github project which would let me interact with spotify from the cli and then we used the chirp sdk for python-
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Spotify to work properly. Had to make a hackish solution by waiting the time of the song before pausing and chirping before playing the next song. Want it to run through JS in the browser natively.
                </p>

                    What I learned

                    More about HTML and JavaScript, also how to use sdk/api and just in general hacking.
