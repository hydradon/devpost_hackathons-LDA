                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I needed more keys to design and program faster, but I had no space. Studies show that you can fit in
                    <strong>
                        400% more keys

                    if you put them on a cube instead of a standard board (don't quote me on this), so I decided to make a programmable macro "cube"!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's 150 reprogrammable keyboard keys in a (cough,
                    <strong>
                        definitely objectively
                    </strong>
                    ) attractive package. If you ever needed keys to design, or program,
                    <em>
                        remind yourself of your parents' disappointment in you
                    </em>
                    , edit text, this project is for you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each key can perform a macro in the form of a string of USB reports (so....basically it can press any number of keys in any order), so you can set shortcuts to save files, run code, insert code templates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The keycaps are blank, so you can write anything on them to keep track of your macros (or just 3D print keycaps with icons already on them!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I designed the circuit boards and switch plate for the keyboards in Autodesk AutoCAD and EAGLE, ordering 5 sets for production from JLCPCB (cheapest place to get PCBs from).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The case that holds the circuit boards together was 3D-printed, and so are the keycaps which go on top of the switches. Each circuit board has an Arduino Nano, which is wired via I2C to a Teensy 3.5 (which emulates the keyboard input).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, I had to solder the circuit boards and 3D print parts beforehand, but I started programming only when H&amp;R started. By the end, I had the cube fully working!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, I was going to design each of the keycaps with their own unique design (for a unique function) and print them out. However, due to time constraints I ended up having to print blanks instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another (perhaps more troublesome) challenge, was that my keycaps had many bumps on them as a result of the 3D printing process, causing them to jam, or not fit onto the switches at all. So, I had to file 150 keycaps to get them to fit (which was not fun at all). Printing each keycap also took 15 minutes, so printing 150 took quite a long time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Minor bump: When I first started running the keyboard, it just did not send any keycodes to my computer (making it useless). However, I restarted the computer (no joke) and it started working again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, this is perhaps my second personal hardware project, so I'm glad that it worked in the end. I'm a fan of designing stuff from scratch, so I was happy to design most of the cube myself. Being in a one person team means I have to do all the work, so I'm proud that I stuck it through.
