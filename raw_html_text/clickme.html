                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Approximately 80,000 people die from Alzheimer&rsquo;s every year. Sometimes our loved ones, family members, or best friends. Different from typical diseases, Alzheimer's is not curable and might cause the patient to lose memory, even those of their loved ones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the go-to mobile application for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease patients, the app utilizes facial recognition technology to help them to recognize their loved ones (using pre-inputted information). With the _ Touch assist _, our app will guide the patient to interact with the screen and provides additional information for the identified relatives. The app also features geolocation warning, emergency medical card, and a _ family client _ to allow families track the location of the patient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the Hackathon, we first utilized Adobe XD to quickly prototype the app functionality and layout. Based on that, we used Swift to code the front end of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We learned Swift and Adobe XD in a day because we required it to code the front end of the app
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Conceptualizing the app was difficult. We looked at all UIs which are very intuitive like swiping features. This would make the app very user-friendly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We learned how to collaborate as a team, and allocate tasks to different group members.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully learned two tools during this hackathon: Swift and Adobe XD. We tried our best to design the interaction between the app and the patient, and we believe the final product would be very user-friendly and intuitive to use.
                </p>

                        Acts like secondary memory; the patient is never insecure about forgetting small things because he can always rely on the app
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wearable eye technology - don't need to use a phone to scan; the patient can see and recognize people. Makes it look like he isn't using the aid of an app- improves self-esteem
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Apple Watch: don't need to have the phone, the apple watch can track the patient's location even when he does not have his phone. If he is out of bounds, the watch would request him to go back
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        AI which tracks episodic memory improvement levels- The patient&rsquo;s response to the app over a period of time can be used to predict his episodic memory improvement levels. This data collected can further be utilized for research.
