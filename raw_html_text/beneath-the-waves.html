                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration mostly came from the Ubisoft challenge prompt,_ creating the unknown _. Their prompts list, with criteria like "infinite", "grayscale", and "random generation" brought the game "Downwell" to mind, which was a thematic inspiration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game in which you pilot a submarine to explore a constantly shifting underwater crypt.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We opted for the Unity game engine, since we found it interesting and wanted to learn how to use it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our group was using Unity for the first time, and so we ran into many walls just learning the ropes on the engine. Also, the built-in VCS for Unity only supports 3 people without payment, so we were forced to use Github. This caused lots of of merge errors as low -level files were edited by Unity automatically. This was further exacerbated because our team was part Windows, part Mac.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The spooky aesthetic was something we didn't cut corners for, and spend a good amount of time tweaking and refining.
