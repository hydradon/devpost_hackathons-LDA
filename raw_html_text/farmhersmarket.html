                    Introducing the FreshWatch An app that helps people who want to eat healthy for cheap! Generally a lot of &ldquo;healthy foods&rdquo; can be quite pricey and for people who are on a tight budget, we introduce our app! To do so, we wanted to bring the focus on &ldquo;in-season&rdquo; foods &ndash; foods that are locally in season. Not only are they cheaper than imported counterparts. They also have higher nutritional content and avoid overseas contaminants. Our app, allows people to see which fruits and veggies are in season and recommend recipes. Ordered by the amount of in-season ingredients they use to help people save money while eating healthily, with food with higher nutritional content.
