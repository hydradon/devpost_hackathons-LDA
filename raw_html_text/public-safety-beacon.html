                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about the user story of people stuck in and affected by natural disasters, and we thought of of what resources we could implement to best help them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps the user in two ways. It helps the user find local resources that provide aid in times of emergency (ex.Food Bank, Hospital), and it helps the user send out a beacon to emergency responders with the user's location and phone number. The emergency responder can also then more easily find out exactly where the user is by looking at a AR view of the user's location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website with a frontend of HTML and CSS, and a backend of Express.js and Node.js. We also used maps APIs from the GCP to assist with directions and marker drops. We also used IOT to send a SMS text with relevant info with the simple click of a button
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to get the IOT text message part up and running.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to accomplish everything that we originally set out to do in a clean and efficient manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to leverage IOT and API technology in a time-efficient manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Public Safety Beacon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to broadcast a message to everyone within a certain radius in the case of these natural disasters.
