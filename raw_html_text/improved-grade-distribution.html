                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students looking to get the most our of the classes we take, we always wanted to make sure we get the best professors. Some class can make or break you depending on what professor you get. Virginia Tech currently has a portal where you can see past grades, but it takes a few minutes to find each class. We wanted a way to quickly and easily find and compare all our classes for the semester.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students can put in a list of potential or current classes and learn what the average GPA of everyone who took the classes was as well as the average GPA per class and the average GPA based on the professor chosen per class. It also shows the grade distribution. Classes where everyone gets an A or F are much different than a class where everyone gets a C.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the ASP.NET web forms framework with bootstrap and an SQL database. We pulled data from the VT server into our own and then built the front-end to easily display the desired information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much of our team was limited in web development experience so the whole process was a fun learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works and for the most part it looks well-done. It is a product we will definitely use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Visual Studio and the ASP.NET framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Improved Grade Distribution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more data and push it out to the general student body.
