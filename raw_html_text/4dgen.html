It is apparent that there is intrinsic value in our unique Singaporean heritage that is worth preserving. However, preserving our heritage isn't a one way street where the authorities does everything. Our nations culture and heritage is part of our Singaporean indentity and it's

                        NONE! WE ARE THAT AMAZING!
                    </strong>
                    Just joking. We are not that good. Model outputs are chained to the input of other models. And since machine learning models are not perfect it is inevitable that there will be some accuracy loss. We had to tweak originals models to our requirement to improve the performance and with the limited time of 24 hours it had been a great challenge.
