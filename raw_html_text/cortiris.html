                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project was inspired by other Assistants in the market like Siri, Cortana and Google assistant, and we decided we would try to make a similar one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cortiris helps you to organize your calendar, allowing to add events and check if you have any on a given day. 
It can also make simple mathematical operations (+,-,*,/), understand some orders and have a small conversation with you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Cortiris using small functions that will evaluate your decisions and make Cortiris ask you specific questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have little to no experience in this field, so challenges we ran into were huge, specially when we tried to make it understand what the user was writing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ended up with a pretty nice range of answers that we think will be enough for this Demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about text analysis, to help Cortiris understand what we are telling it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cortiris
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on improving Cortiris by adding an interface, as well as Voice recognition.
We also want to give it acces to other companies API to be able to integrate more functions to it like, for example, connecting it to Netflix, Google Calendar, your frigde, etc
