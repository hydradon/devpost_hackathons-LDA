                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to allow people with brilliant ideas to connect with innovators who would be able to solve the toughest solutions. By turning crowd funding on its head, we provide an interesting means of solving problems that the public desires.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website allows people to fund projects that they want done. Someone can post a problem or idea to which they would like a solution, product, etc and creators campaign to be selected to create the product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We constructed a website that allows people to effectively view ideas and support the ideas that they would like to see in action.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't let our limited knowledge of web development hold us back, but our biggest pitfall was our lack of software experience in general - which we didn't let us hold us back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing a website with minimal experience and getting creative with both the design and backend. We didn't use any frameworks and built everything from scratch except for the imported npm modules and the programming languages/scripting languages themselves.

                    What we learned

                    We learned about the processes of developing a website.
