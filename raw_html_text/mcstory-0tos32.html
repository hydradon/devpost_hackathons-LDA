                        Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    We were inspired by the abilities of AI based virtual assistants such as Alexa, Siri and Google Home.

                        What it does
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    It creates a unique and custom story for the user by generating random (but cohesive!) sentences/texts based on a database of existing stories. This site could be used as an educational tool for young children, schools, lower income families, and learners of the English language.

                    <strong>
                        How I built it
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    We followed a tutorial on training a text generating neural network (a.k.a. machine learning).
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        Challenges I ran into
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    Figuring out how text generating neural networks work. Debugging something that we don't completely understand. Trying to think logically off of 2 hours of sleep and lots of sugar.
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    We were able to make a neural network new sentences/texts based on existing texts and it makes sense!
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        What I learned
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    We learned a lot on Automatic Text Generation and Text Generating Neural Networks.

                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    Speech assisted story generator. Being able to save and archive stories.
