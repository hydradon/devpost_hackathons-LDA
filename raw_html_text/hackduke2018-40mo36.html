                    Sourced is a site for individuals to share educational materials, give feedback over them, and find educational materials which they are interested in. It's goal is to provide a centralized location for individuals to find free educational resources which are scattered across the internet while also giving the proper credit to creators who made the material. This platform wouldn't have a lengthy screening process thus allowing anyone to post material, not just those who have the time and resources to get certified on Coursera or Udacity. Furthermore, it would be easier to find information you are looking for rather than first having to sift through a 40 hour course.
