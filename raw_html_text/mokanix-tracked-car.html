                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to map the air quality of the surroundings using an automatically controlled car that we can use over Wi-Fi and track its location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple remote controller car that you can track with Google Maps
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a motor car kit and connected it to a raspberry pi, and hooked it up to a mokanix sim with a gsm dongle. Location data is collected via the mokanix API from an Angular webapp
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't have much hardware experience so building the car was quite challenging!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to remote control the car
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Electronics basics, raspberry pi connectivity, mokanix API
                </p>
