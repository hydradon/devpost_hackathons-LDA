                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using the concept of depth image processing
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                    <li>
                        The image we were getting on the screen was inverted 
2.Storing the the letters in the form of image and accessing them to display
3.Interpolation to getting the smooth curves
                    </li>
                </ol>
