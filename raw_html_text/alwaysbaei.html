                <p>
                    The three of us have been best friends for years and we
                    <em>
                        constantly
                    </em>
                    lift each other up with positive reinforcement. We're like our own personal hype squad! HackSC highlighted in its Civil Rights/Liberties vertical that everyone
                    <em>
                        deserves
                    </em>
                    to feel comfortable in their own skin. We cannot stress how important this is!

                    We connected very well with the sponsors from

                        alwaysAI
                    </a>
                    , so we used their
                    <strong>
                        Computer Vision
                    </strong>
                    technology to identify human faces and only mention positive comments about them! It's a constant reminder that you are incredible and deserve to have a stream of positive reinforcement. For version 1, all you need is a webcam! :) For version 2, you'll just need a smart mirror so you have something great to wake up to every morning!

                    We had too many ideas, and our main issue was finding the relevant datasets. However, using the AlwaysAI API was fun and easy to setup and use.
