                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired by the courage of people living with lifelong incurable chronic diseases.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WellBE works with Exonum, a permissioned blockchain, to create smart contracts so that patients can access cross-border healthcare using legal cross-border payments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WellBE processes the medical appointment workflow completing all financial transactions on the permissioned blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
