                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since prom season is coming up, we decided to work on a project relevant to our lives. On various Facebook groups, students post dresses they want to rent or sell or offer to do makeup for others. We wanted to create a more streamlined environment for students to find the clothing, accessories, and services that they need through a trading system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All you have to do is request a trade with the user whose item you desire. Once your request is accepted, you can contact the person and arrange a way to make the trade whether it be in person, through the mail, or a drop-off at one of our convenient nearby lockers! If you don't have anything to trade or that the recipient would like, you can exchange an IOU in place of an item to be redeemed later, or the two of you can reach your own agreement (e.g. offer to do make-up or nails). With Our Collective Closet, you'll be able to get what you need (clothes, accessories, shoes, etc.) to complete the perfect outfit!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used front-end web development languages including javascript, html, and css to create our website. For much of our layout, we implemented Twitter's Bootstrap framework for simpler and better designs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the backend search service as well as log-in tabs since we were unable to download a server to create a mySQL database. We were also unfamiliar with php and other back-end languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a working site, aesthetic designs, integrating all the various pages in a streamlined fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web design skills with html, css, javascript, and the Bootstrap framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Our Collective Closet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Launching in-person trading stations in the neighborhood to improve user privacy, creating the back-end code using php and mySQL, adding an IOU system and in-site personal messaging service to facilitate usage.
