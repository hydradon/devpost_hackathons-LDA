                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you're looking for help moving furniture, painting your house, or even data classification, look no further than Blocked Tasks!
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blocked Tasks is a two way marketplace where Job Posters can post a new job (eg, "I need help for 30 minutes to move furniture and will pay 0.01 ETH"), and where a Job Consumer can sign up to complete the task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A job posting is an individual smart contract on the Ethereum block chain.  A Job Listing smart contract tracks all of these job postings so Job Consumers can view all the available jobs (to be built).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon completion of the task, the Job Poster marks the job as done and the Job Consumer gets paid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to build the entire system on the Blockchain, and not use any external servers or databases.  The site is hosted on Github pages.  We use web3 and MetaMask
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Solidity for the first time took waaay longer than we anticipated.  Remix is a great tool but there is a steep learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a contract to be created and having the money get paid out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solidity is not Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blocked Tasks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a Job Listing directory, which is another smart contract that gets updated with new jobs.
Adding reputation (tied to the wallet address) for all parties, Job Posters and Job Consumers.
