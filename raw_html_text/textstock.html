                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard to get into something new, especially in a topic as real and competitive as stocks. With out app, we hope to remove many of the difficulties users would face and embolden them to learn about a very interesting and complex system!
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    With TextStock, you can get the latest financial and stock news through SMS messaging - no need for cellular data! You can get a quick glimpse at the 5 top financial news stories for the day, look up news about a specific ticker you're interested in, and quickly get opinions on the top ten stocks of the week!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build TextStock on StdLib's toolbox environment using JavaScript and Node.js. We incorporated Twilio's SMS API from StdLib and implemented API from Stock News.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with API calling, which we resolved with the help of Jacob Lee and the StdLib team!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing such a groundbreaking and innovative and wonderful and great and amazing and helpful app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement APIs and make them talk to each other, and got experience with using JavaScript and Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TextStock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although one would already find TextStock immensely helpful to their quest for financial knowledge, in the future we hope to add a subscription system so a user can get automated daily news without having to even send a message! Additionally, we hope to incorporate more customized search options, such as financial news about specific sectors, recommendations for potentially interesting stocks, and selecting for the reliability of sources!
