                    Beepy's Addition Bots is a fun game designed for younger children to practice their addition skills by helping Beepy the robot raise three cute animal bots. Children play this game by solving second grade addition problems to obtain food pellets for their animal bots. Wondering how their bots will transform over time motivates kids to continue solving math problems that will help their bots reach their final forms.

                    This skill is designed exclusively for the Echo Show and makes use of many different and engaging illustrations, especially of Beepy's numerous expressions, to keep kids entertained. This skill will not work on Echo devices without a display, such as the Amazon Echo or Amazon Echo Dot.
