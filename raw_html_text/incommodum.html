                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the opening ceremony, before it started, a team member named Gabriel Dean was talking about app ideas. He thought about previous app ideas, one that he called 'Uncomfortable', which would make you do things that were uncomfortable to improve yourself. We implemented this and many other ideas, such as customized tasks and experience points.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incommodum is an app that lets you improve your work ethic, charity, socialization and more almost without knowing it. Using days worth of research, our team has developed and researched bite-sized tasks for users to perform that will gradually increase their skills. For every task, you gain XP points and can level up for more challenging tasks. Tasks can be based on location, current level or what you choose. (e.g: "Go say hello to a family member." Task Tags (that's what we call them): Socialization, Level 1 Only)

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incommodum was built using hard work, passion, Java, Android Studio and XML. We all started with little to no knowledge of Android XML, however Josiah knew a lot about Java, so designing the app was the only problem we ran into. Everyone else helped design the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Incommodum works on a server-client basis. A dedicated server run on Josiah's laptop contains task information and user data and can be readily accessed on demand. It is secure as a UUID (unique ID that's very long) is generated and is used almost like a username and password as if it were on a video game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot. Android XML made things very hard as none of us were familiar with it, so we had to use templates, edit those templates, mess around and much more. A full server code rewrite was required because we realized that we had different serialized classes between client and server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app basics are done. It works, you can register and it's clean and easy to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to design an app, how to build an app and about XML and Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Incommodum
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully Incommodum can be added upon. Cleaning up the app and pushing to AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the most hopeful future for this app.
