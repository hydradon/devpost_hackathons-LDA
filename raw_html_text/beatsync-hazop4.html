                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music has a great impact on all of our lives, but it's something we almost never share. When you walk across campus, what do you see but a sea of students, walking around with headphones in? What if this changed? What if there was a platform for people to not only find their favorite tracks on the Spotify platform but also compare those tracks to those around them? A heat map of music perhaps, a cacophony of sounds, originating from the user but joining a chorus of like-minded individuals. What if you can find these like-minded people and meet over classic rock, EDM, or rap? This is the world we envision.

                <p>
                    BeatSync is to get a user's top played tracks, artists, and genres and collecting that data into a local map. This is the basic functionality we want to accomplish and plan on expansions that will make use of geolocation.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BeatSync is to run on Spotify's Web API, through node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few major roadblocks were abundant during the life of BeatSync @ HackMerced 2019. One major hurdle was the learning curve of creating a locally hosted website with a server JavaScript file connecting to the Spotify API. Once connected, we were able to get a user's session tokens but found a second major hurdle, running through Spotify's Authorization pathway for OAuth tokens.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of &amp; what we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As novices to website building, members on our team learned valuable introductions to HTML, Node.JS, Spotify's Web API, and more. We learned how much dedication is needed to run to a local server, and what is needed to host one online.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A major feature we would like to add to this music map is a listener's hub. The user would be able to view this map and see what users listen to around them. Branching from this would be meeting individuals based on artist and genre affinity.
