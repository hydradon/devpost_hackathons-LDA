                    We wanted to help inform people. We believe that information is power, and by having information people can help prevent cyber attacks. The website provides information about cyber attacks and how they can be prevented. We also have a credit card scrambler for the user to interact with. We used Dreamweaver and idle to help us create this website. A challenge we ran into was adding the python program into the html file. We learned that when people really want to do something they can. They are able to accomplish anything they want to.
