                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever needed a place to study, but didn't know where to go?? With DTF you'll always find a place for your educational endeavors!
Often times, my friends and I have been in situations where we were not sure where the best place to study was. We do not believe that anybody should have to spend more time looking for a place to study than studying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app locates nearby study spots, including filters for certain specifications that any hard-working student might need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using the Android Studio IDE. The majority of the app was built off of the Google Maps API, allowing the user to see their current location and display on a map where nearby study locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues parsing through the distance matrix, which is returned to us in the JSON object format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of building our own app from scratch, considering that none of us have much experience with this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about the basics of creating an app using Android Studio and Google APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DownToFocus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that there are many interesting features that can be implemented in DTF that will improve the user's experience and make studying easier and more enjoyable. Some of these features include sharing locations with friends through the app, as well as a music-playing function. We would also like to expand our range of filters and study locations.
