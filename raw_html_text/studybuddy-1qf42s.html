                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people lose their focus while studying and suffer with poor posture. As students, we are all struggling with this, so our team decided to tackle these problems once and for all !!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StudyBuddy is a mobile app that analyzes, stores and enhances user's study quality. StudyBuddy generates study sections accordingly to user's references. During a study section, StudyBuddy analyzes user's posture and notifies them when they're in a poor posture.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrated
                    <code>
                        firebase
                    </code>
                    with
                    <code>
                        react-native
                    </code>
                    . We used
                    <code>
                        firebase
                    </code>
                    to handle authentication and to store user's data. The main app was developed with
                    <code>
                        react-native
                    </code>
                    so that the app is accessible for both Android and iOS devices.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The biggest challenge was to detect facial features and incorrect sitting posture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another challenge was set up the project environment including integrating
                        <code>
                            firebase
                        </code>
                        with
                        <code>
                            react-native
                        </code>
                        and making sure that the app is running in both platforms: Android and iOS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Next challenge was to learn
                        <code>
                            react-native
                        </code>
                        . None of us had any experience with
                        <code>
                            react-native
                        </code>
                        and mobile app development, but we wanted to challenge ourselves to learn new frameworks and technologies.
