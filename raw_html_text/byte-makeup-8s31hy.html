                    These days, it's more and more important for female to know how to do makeup since it's important to show beauty, which can help us the best to build the confidence in the society. However, there are still many of us don't know how to do makeup due to a lot of reasons like being lazy or don't know where to get suitable resources. Our team haven't tried API before so we ran into many issues connecting with backends and frontends. Thanks to helpful mentors, we finally built a beautiful UI website.
