                    The IntelliSpace VR allows you to actually code and compile in an immersive 3D environment. We truly believe that this is the future of learning software development in a way that excites the minds of future developers and encourages the fun exploration of code. Become One With The Code!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used A-frame with a combination of a Node.JS and Java backend in order to compile various different languages, including Java and Python.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ease of communication between servers was a relationship that proved to be very difficult to replicate with the VR logic.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a more or less functioning prototype!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the extent to which it can be difficult to implement A-frames and have them communicate between webVR and Node servers.
