                    We wanted to do something fancy with APIs, but didn't have any prior hacking experience. We decided to set our goals small and create a website. Two of our team members are from North Carolina, so in honor of our families living in fear of Hurricane Florence, we decided to create a website about hurricane safety. We learned a lot about using HTML and CSS.
