                    One in four students suffer from mental health issues, and suicide is the most common cause of death 20-49 year olds. Mental health problems are prolific and can have a serious impact on quality of life. NHS mental health services are oversubscribed, with waiting times over 6 month the norm, so time with clinical practitioners is precious. In addition to this, more information about the efficacy of antidepressants and their adverse effects is always welcome.

                    We created an interactive website which allows patients to self-administer a questionnaire to assess the current severity of their depression and anxiety, using the PHQ-9 questions for depression and GAD-7 questions for anxiety. A heavy emphasis is placed on user experience to make the process as easy as possible. This is especially important as motivation can be heavily affected in depression. The output from this questionnaire is sent to the server, which has the potential to be used to generate a report to be sent to the patient's doctor. The patient can provide a phone number, and then receive weekly text message encouraging them to take the questionnaire again to reassess their mental state. These weekly scores are linked to the phone number, avoiding usernames and passwords to make the process even easier. The weekly scores have the potential be used to generate a graph, which both the patient and clinician could view to see whether current treatment plans are working.

                <p>
                    We used javascript/jquery to create the interactive website.  We used node.js to create the server and the nexmo API to send the weekly text message reminders.
