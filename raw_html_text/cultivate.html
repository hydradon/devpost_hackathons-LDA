                    Inspiration: We were inspired by the plight of second and third generation immigrants in the sense of feeling disconnected from their native culture due to the pressures to assimilate to American culture. We wanted to develop an application that would help these people connect with their culture more effectively by allowing them to learn their native languages.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: The application connects second and third generation immigrants with mentors/teachers who can help the students learn their cultural language.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We made an Android application.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Learning how to use Android Studio and git, and program together. We were only a two person team so it was challenging to figure out how to divide the work.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Completing a minimum viable product and using a Google API.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned more about using Android Studio, how to ideate and plan a mobile application, and how to solve git issues.

                    What's next for Cultivate: Add the event aspect, put all of the information in a database and fix the UI.
