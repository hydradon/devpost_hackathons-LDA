                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that finding the right food based on how you feel might not always be the easiest thing to do. Unfortunately, our different moods make us in the mood for different food places. But what are they? We introduce to you Mood Food.
We are team Mood Food. We are three RIT students in three different computing majors; Priya (Computing Security) , Niki (Computer Science), and Angela (Software Engineering). We went to BrickHacks, a hackathon at RIT and after a conversation we realized that our moods affect what we want to eat, but sometimes it is not so easy to figure out what food that might be. This website we hopefully the lives of people easier. It will definitely make our lives easier.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First you select your mood. Then you select your food based on your mood. Then we give you options of where to eat and the information you need to get to that place. It is that easy!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with building the framework of the website with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. We personally created our own logo and icons using adobe photoshop. We then use Django as our platform to create the web framework for python. At the end we utilized an API to create a map based to display the recommendation place on the website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The framework was a little tricky because we choice to make it on a responsive grid so that it will look good on both a laptop and mobile device.
Django was a new concept to some of us so this project basically an introduction to Django.

                    What's next for Mood Food(14A)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to incorporate more API such as the Yelp API. We also wanted to incorporate machine learning so the app can learn what the user likes.
