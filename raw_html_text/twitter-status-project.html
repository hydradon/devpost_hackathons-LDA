                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's exciting to see how social media posts are doing: the amount of likes they get, the amount of comments they get, and more! So, we decided to make an AI that would be able to show us exactly that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses an AI and Twitter API to predict and print the insights of Twitter posts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to build the backend and HTML to build the user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't able to finish it.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to build everything, but we couldn't put it together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned HTML for the project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will input the data and actually run the process.
