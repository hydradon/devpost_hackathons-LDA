                    Through the Mist is a pixel art game we created as part of the HackSC 2020 competition, with the intent of tackling the fourth pillar; mental health.  But we wanted to do something different.  To truly help those in desperation, you need to fill them with hope, and determination.  You need to tell them a story.  And that's exactly what we set out to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through the Mist follows two brothers as they make their way home. One grappling with his mental illness and the other helping him along the way. It is a narrative that perfectly encapsulates the concept that mental illness truly affects us all, and we hope that players will be able to build trust and faith in one another as they continue on in their journey.

                    In the spirit of the Hackathon, all assets were created by our two person team this weekend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wished to focus on supporting multiplayer capabilities as well as interesting designs and gameplay, and so, unfortunately, much of the art is left unfinished.  However, we did successfully manage to set up Photon networking for our project as well as a split screen mode, where you and a partner share a computer as you follow these brothers on their journey.  Unfortunately, Photon tends to be a bit finnicky at times, so it is not always the smoothest gameplay experience.

                <p>
                    Unity's Particle Systems were used to create the mist affect and the player playing as the younger brother can remove the mist as it surrounds their older brother. Interestingly enough, the older brother may delete the mist as well, but only if he's with his younger brother.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first part of the game revolves around the younger brother finding his older brother at a party, having spiraled out of control, but finding a way back to reality through his brother.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the second part of the game, we created simple scripts to iterate through various art assets in order to create an interesting intractable experience driven by utilizing visual stigma to solve a puzzle
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the third part of the game, arguably the most technically difficult, we used Unity's raycasting to track the other brother's movement, and while he was in the line of sight, he's paralyzed, unable to move as he struggles to contain his temptations and decide what he truly wants to do. However, if the younger brother breaks this line of sight, the older brother is free to move again, confident he wants to be with his younger brother, eventually making his way back to where he belongs.  Home.
