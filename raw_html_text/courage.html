                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's often a stereotype of homeless people spending any donations given to them on drugs and alcohol. What if there was an easy way for people to donate to them knowing where their donation is likely to go?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Courage allows people to confidently donate money to a homeless shelter on behalf of a homeless person, by allowing them to see major spending categories that previous donations have gone to.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it for Android, and have a homeless shelter admin page written in react. The backend is in Go and our database is PostgreSQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Forgot that to unmarshal JSON in Go, the struct needs to have its fields capitalized.
                </p>
