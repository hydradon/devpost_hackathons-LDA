                    This application attempts to solve the sharing of information between Continuum of Care (CoC) members. The application also attempts to provide referral information to shelters, so that they can enroll the homeless into programs to help find permanent housing as quick as possible.

                    CoC -- Web Application

                <p>
                    A web app captures information across CoC members. This app helps the members track those seeking help with financial, medical, utility or employment benefits and programs. The app will allow for the gathering of information across CoC members in a common document. These members will capture those who are having trouble, or seeking benefits to begin building a history in a common way. This will allow the members of a CoC to be able to track individuals across benefits and programs.

                <p>
                    The app is complimented by an iOS app that allows homeless shelters to gather information about those seeking shelter because of becoming homeless. The iOS application tries to provide as much identifiable information about shelter seekers. This information then can be used to look up individuals who may then be qualified for certain benefits to get them into programs that can get them out of being homeless as soon as possible.

                    By providing a common API for CoC members and shelters needing to obtain information about potential homeless persons or families, they can access the data in a common pattern to help ensure the quickest and smoothest transition from shelter to benefit programs. This store provides a common document and queries about those seeking benefits to then provide to analytics to researchers to see which programs may have turned down those who could have been
