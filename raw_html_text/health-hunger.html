                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    many people in our community struggle to find healthy and allergy-friendly 
restaurants and recipes, from that we got the idea to help in making their lives easier,
 and help connect restaurants with customers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the main idea is to classify recipes category from the ingredients list, 
using a machine-learning algorithm, in addition to providing healthy and
 allergy-friendly restaurants where users can order from the best available 
healthy restaurant options.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    we use react, python and java Script
We create Script that do data cleaning from the thing that we don&rsquo;t use 
features extraction from data
building a model that predict the allergy categorize .
