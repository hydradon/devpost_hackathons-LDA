                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While riding in my car through my community, I often turn to my wife and say "They should really add a stop sign here." or "I wish there was a traffic light here, it takes forever to enter this road.". This gave me the idea to create this app, which enables citizens to request things, like traffic lights or stop signs, to make their community safer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this application citizens will be able to choose from five different traffic improvements (Stop Sign, Traffic Light, Speed Bumps, Reduced Speed and Crosswalk). Once they choose which traffic improvement want to add, the click on the desired place on the map and fill out important attributes (Contact information, a comment to explain why it is important and when they submitted it).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The citizens are also able to look at already existing submission and if they agree with the submission can click a "Like" button. This might encourage the local government to approve a submission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started by building a feature service in ArcGIS Desktop and once I was finished I hosted the service in an ArcGIS Online account. I consumed this service in my ArcGIS Javascript API app. I created this app via dojo and the ArcGIS Javascript API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wish I was able to do a survey to see what traffic improvements, besides the once I included, the public would like to see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is great to see what I am able to do, with self taught knowledge of coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to do everything that I thought of, with the ArcGIS Javascript API and dojo combined.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to create a mobile version of my app.
