                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A large percent of people have mental health issues, ranging from mood swings to serious depression. We conducted a survey prior to designing this web app. The survey result shows that most people want to support their friends and family more during everyday life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a social network with a real-time interactive dynamic network representation. It allows people with mental health problems to communicate with the outside world. A stranger can send you a flower, a cup of hot chocolate, a smile or a hug from our web app. You can update your mood every day when you log into Radiant. Your mood will then be represented by a color of a small balloon. You can also see the mood of others around you, including your family members, your friends and strangers. You can intersect with them by simply click on their balloons and send them your love. If you are little low, then a little care and support from your friend or even a stranger will likely bring you up.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django web framework (Python) to build the backend of the app. The front end is a mixture of HTML, CSS and d3.js (for rendering network graphs).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are unfamiliar with web-design and D3.js has a steep learning curve. We struggle to come out with an efficient algorithm that randomly draws data from our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully finished a demo-version of our web app. The interactive network community is really cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to communicate with teammates, how to design a large web-based scalable project and how to visualize data in efficient time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Radiant --- a web app for light communication
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will complete an official version in a month or so. The hope is that we will then build its mobile app version in three months.
