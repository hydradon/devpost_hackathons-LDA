                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you're looking for not only a video on a topic, but a specific sub-topics within a video, it can be hard to locate it.  We realised that it would be very helpful to be able to search within and across videos to locate what you're after, whether that's for lectures, TED talks, or other videos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We make online lectures searchable, without requiring lecturers to do anything.  Our chrome extension lets you search for specific content within a lecture and across multiple lectures, and jump straight to that part of the video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it as a Chrome extension that embeds our own search bar within the online lectures website.  We obtained the text to be searched across in two ways:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Audio was extracted from the lectures and sent to IBM's Watson to provide us with a transcript
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Images were taken from the video stream every 60 seconds, and sent to Azure's service to extract text from within images
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    These two sources of text provided us with the data to use with Algolia to power the search.  The Chrome extension interacts with the search API to display results, and with the DOM of the video site to show the search bar and jump to the right video and time in video.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                    <li>
                        Some of the libraries for react did not work as expected
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Struggled to find a good search platform until we settled with Algolia
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Difficulty processing the json responses from Watson and Azure to put it into a good format for searching across
                    </li>

                        Differentiating between a = b and a == b while sleep deprived ;)

                        Committing node_modules to repo (upside: gave one team member most-lines-changed accolade)

                        Audio transcription is not great (supplementing it with text from images helped significantly)
