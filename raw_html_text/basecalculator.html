                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every first year CS student (ourselves included!) struggles with base conversion calculations. We wanted to develop a tool for students to learn and explore base conversions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BaseCalculator can perform base conversions for bases two through sixteen. It can execute simple arithmetic, using numbers with different bases as inputs and converting to any base for output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The JavaFx application was built in IntelliJ.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that our project works and everything we wanted to do was completed before the deadline. We were able to implement it in a timely manner and were able to break down tasks effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we were all working on a larger scale project for the first time, we learned a lot about version control and the use of git. We learned about the development of simple user interfaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BaseCalculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to work on developing a more dynamic user interface that could include longer mathematical expresses, with the use of brackets and other operators. We would also like to implement the use of the keyboard in the application.
