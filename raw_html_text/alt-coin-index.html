                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even in the western world access to certain markets is still a challenge.  I have wanted access to certain alt coins in my crypto portfolio for some time now, but due to regulations at the country and state level have prevented this.  So I had been thinking about permission less alternatives to get this exposure in my portfolio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generates an ERC20 token that tracks the dominance of bitcoins relative to altcoins and a second token that tracks Altcoins dominance relative to bitcoin.  These over-collateralized assets backed by DAI whose backing for the token holder fluctuates based on dominance moves.  At expiration the %dominance is paid to the token holder in the form of DAI and the remaining collateral sent back to the token facility generator.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this project by cloning UMA's repo to use their smart contracts with custom asset definitions

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Price feeds as the amount of supported feeds is limited currently.
                </p>

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Solidity programming. Some web development.

                <p>
                    Hopefully UMA adds this price feed and I can generate token facilities to get this exposure.
