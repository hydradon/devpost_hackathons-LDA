                    Inspiration: We want to help people become faster coders. We turned it into a fun game where you can continue to challenge yourself by bettering your or other people's high scores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does: The game is a "type racer game". The game will keep score of how fast you type the code snippets which are precoded in the preferred coding language. Not only do you practice to type at a faster pace, it is also a way to learn and to make it a habit of typing certain pieces of code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it: We built the app mainly with front-end logic with support from Firebase. We have basic user data and code snippets with high scores saved with Firebase and use RESTful API calls to receive data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into: The team never used Firebase before, so we had to code the backend completely using the Firebase UI. That meant we had less options for back-end code, so we had to manipulate data in the front-end in order to comply with the database schema.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since we had timers and high scores, managing state was a big challenge since there were a lot of components sharing the same state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: we were able to build a fully functional app from beginning to finish. Even though we left out some nice-to-have features, we feel that our application is functionally complete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned: We learned what it is like to be part of a Hackathon, since it is the first time for all 3 of us. We learned how to collaborate using git. We learned how to delegate tasks to each member.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for Minute Coder: We want to build a server on which multiple users can code race at the same time. This will make the game a lot more appealing since you can play with your friends in real time.
