                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by literally just an empty sheet of paper that we were referring to as our useless list of ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays useless lists of information in an annoying and convoluted method
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built using my past programs as examples, my knowledge, and google for learning how to use new tools and methods. I also had assistance from my team in making portions of it as well as in making the lists which the program uses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There weren't any particularly noteworthy challenge although we did have some strange errors transferring the files between computers so that we could all get a copy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that this program will likely never have a use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I taught myself more about how to use GUIs in java as well as how to add sound and I got experience in using listener events which I have only used once or twice in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Incredibly Useful Lists
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There likely isn't anything next but perhaps I'll add more useful features when I get bored or just need to code without purpose.
