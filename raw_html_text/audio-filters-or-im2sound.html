                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was Google's magenta API and the sub-project A.I. duet. The aim was to give a machine pre-trained to produce music, image based cues extracted from the said image using feature extractors and let it generate music from it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm takes in an image and produces a string of music from it. The instrument options are - single piano, - piano medley, - piano and drums
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I extracted high level features from an image using a CNN and naively took the top 10 most significant features to generate a midi key (note). I added the relative minor third of the major key and made a list of notes which are fed as the 'primer' to the main RNN generating the music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        finding an open source audio editor to play midi files
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        handling midi playback for multiple files at the same time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        overlaying different midi files and wrapping up the code for the whole project in time
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
----ACCOMPLISHMENTS----
Generating 'option' based music (single piano, double piano, drums) based on cues from any given image. The algorithm is naive right now, but is flexible in its treatment of generated variables as either 'hardcoded parameters' or learned hyperparameters - as future improvements.

                    <li>
                        generate genre based music which is learned either from the context or user specified
