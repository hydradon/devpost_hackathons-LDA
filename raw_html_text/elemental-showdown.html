                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a unique VR experience where players could compete against one another in an arena-style environment.  We were all fans of the Avatar animated series and decided to recreate the pro-bending battles from Legend of Kora, where athletes with the ability to control the elements compete to show off their power.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Elemental Fury gives players the power to bend the elements of fire, earth, air, and water to their will, they must use all the abilities at their disposal to push each other out of the Arena.
Fire &amp; Earth - players can use the strength of fire &amp; earth to push back their opponent
Air - players can use the swiftness of air to dodge attacks
Water - players can use the power of water to stun their foe
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a strong team of experienced VR developers and we are all close friends with one another.  This allowed us to coordinate our tasks well by setting clear and realistic goals for development.  We utilized Unity's Collab tool to share our assets and code with one another quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our game was developed for the HTC Vive and we used standard VR development tools such as VRTK and Steam VR to track user movements and actions.  We used Photon Networking for Unity to sync two Vives together and allow 
players to compete against their friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems with internet lag and syncing objects accurately over the network. We especially had a problem creating a realistic looking water effect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to get networking working correctly, that we were able to create multiple powers and effects for users to play with, and design a fun and unique multiplayer VR experience in such a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a multiplayer VR application using networks and how to create our own custom 3D models for our games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Elemental Fury
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement more players per lobby, additional powers, cooler effects, a skill tree, and other optimizations to make the game run more smoothly.
