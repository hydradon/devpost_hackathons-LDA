                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all heard our friends complain about being hesitant to walk alone in a dark parking lot at school, this app aims to combat that insecurity by bringing them closer into contact with their schools campus security.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students fail to remember their university's campus police number, this simple application that can contact your university's emergency campus police number, their regular number, or even 911. It works for all of the CSU's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to manually get the contact information from each university, format the data, then come up with a simple way to display and access it. The entire app was created using android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first time many of the members in our group had developed for android. Coming up with a way to get the contact information for each university was also a large challenge since we were unable to find a single place online with that information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to be able to finish a fully functional app, even if it looks a little rough.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most valuable lesson we learned was that skill and knowledge does not hold you back when working in a group, learning on the fly is something we can all do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EM Campus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can implement a nicer menu system in the future, as well as include a GPS system, and finally to add more colleges not just CSU's.
