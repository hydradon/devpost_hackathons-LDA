                        My Grandfather
                    </strong>
                    is my inspiration. Though he is not there anymore but his words inspired me to always move forward to learn for social good and never to look down or feel depressed.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a racing game for children and it is 3D. It's actually to show the developers that React360 makes it very easy to build 3D games. I don't want to get any award but please bring my project into the limelight so that other developers can learn from it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using React360 and CSS. React360 framework really proved very useful in this project.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into challenges getting the icon images which I agree I copied from the internet and am sorry for that. I solved issues like the object was not moving properly then set the height of other objects and then setting up the audio.

                <p>
                    It was really fun working upon the project and I am a big fan of React360 now. I highly recommend my juniors to use React360 for 3D application development.
                </p>

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned a treasure a valuable experience of my life. It was a great moment for me to work on this project.

                <p>
                    It's my love. I will add levels for the game involving other objects which will try to attack upon the car and the player should avoid that.
