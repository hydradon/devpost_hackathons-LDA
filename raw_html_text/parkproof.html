                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Friends and family who drive a lot struggle to find parking spaces. Especially students who need to get to class on time and don't use public transportation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get user's current location and find all nearby parking spaces within a certain km radius from them. The app will show the number of parking spaces available in total from all nearby spaces and update the user on their availability. It'll also function as a GPS when a certain parking space is selected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using android-studio, Java, and Google Maps API, we made a map that marks the user's location as well as all the parking spaces nearby. Figma was used to make the UI.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we never really worked with API's before, our biggest challenge was learning how to use them and how to implement them into our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a Google Map on android with location markers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making an app is not easy.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to cover larger areas, getting business partners, and find parking spots in other cities besides places near the user.
