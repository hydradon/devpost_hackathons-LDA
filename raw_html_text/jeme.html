                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all been there: we're with a bunch of friends, we want to get something to eat, but it's tricky all agreeing on somewhere to go. If we're not local, we might not even know what's around. Before you know it, half the group have starved. There's surely a better way. Jeme allows you to vote on what foods you feel like, and then pick a suitable restaurant nearby. No fuss, super quick.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jeme (pronounced "yem-eh") allows you to find somewhere to eat with friends, whilst allowing everyone to express their preferences. It will work out the best choices by considering everyone's votes and give you directions to somewhere everyone can be happy eating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jeme is a combination of a pretty font-end UI, written in HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript; and a modern Python 3 backend for running the voting algorithm and gathering data using various APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with a combination of APIs is always a challenge, making sure everything interacts in just the right way. Things get tricky when servers are involved and it really took a lot of ingenuity to tie everything together in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a 24-hour project, Jeme works really well. It feels slick and fast and achieves what we set out to do, with minimal fuss.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jeme
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Without getting feedback from people trying Jeme out, there's no point coming up with fun new features to add. Jeme is supposed to be efficient, and we need to be careful not to overload its simplicity with all sorts of gears and options. We feel there's real potential for Jeme to be a useful tool, though, so we're keen to see where we can take it next.
