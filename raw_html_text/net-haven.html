                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to win a prize so we looked at different categories. The idea of Safe Haven was born when one of our group members thought it would be a cool idea if we could create a web screening for people who may be young and going through difficult phases in life and are affected by bullying or harassment, or who simply struggle with serious anxiety. The idea was to be able to be warned about possible the hostility that can appear on the web. This is just a demo but the goal is to create a filter for those who want them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Net Haven gets a URL from the user then checks all the text on that web page via a 2 step analysis. The first analysis step is IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer to determine the levels of Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness in the content of the given page. Then we used bokeh, a python graphing library, to show these levels in a graphical model. The second analysis step grabs the text from the given site and compares it to a dictionary of racist, sexist, and overall offensive content. Then we get an average of how much vulgar content is found and display it graphically through bokah. Lastly we compare the 2 analysis levels to get a range of the harassing content on that web page and determine if it&rsquo;s safe, partially dangerous or dangerous.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python Jquery and Javascript with some JSON files, to create the string parser that separates the text from the HTML on the webpage. Then we multi-threaded the analysis process to run both levels of analysis simultaneously. Later we created the Web version for the Chrome extension using more Javascript and ngrok to allow the software to be used as a Chrome extension, and we used sockets to transfer data from python to Javascript. .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the Python to the Javascript in a fast and effective manner, displaying the software as a non-invasive Chrome extension, and rendering the result of the analysis in a timely manner, using IBM Bluemix API's without accessing the credentials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything! We were happy to use python and its multiple libraries to run the analysis as fast as possible, being able to use Watson API's in a project, using socket programming to connect Python to Javascript and creating an app that can actually help and make an impact in the global community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of python code, a better implementation of socket programming with Javascript and Python, focusing on creating apps that run on a timely manner for websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Net Haven
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add support for different web browsers and hopefully create a system for comparing images and videos to see every possible form of harassment.
