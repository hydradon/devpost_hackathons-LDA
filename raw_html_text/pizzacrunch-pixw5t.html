                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everybody loves pizza, but nobody likes being unhealthy. We created PizzaCrunch so that you could indulge safely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PizzaCrunch tracks your calories and tells you how many slices of pizza you can eat accordingly. Actually, even cooler PizzaCrunch waits until you burn more calories than there are in a slice of pizza before allowing you to eat a slice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app natively for the iPhone and Apple Watch using Swift. We gather data using the HealthKit framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced challenges when we were trying to make cool animations. For example, we had to make it so that a pizza image would fill up periodically as the user went about there day and burnt more calories. Other challenges included Apple Watch integration, which were fairly simple to get around. Also, at the end Git failed on us and messed up some code in the interface builder while merging the project from a branch to master. Fortunately all the good code was saved in the branch and we managed to submit that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked hard throughout the challenge and built an app that works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We practiced and refined our knowledge of the swift programming language and built an awesome and practical application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PizzaCrunch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cooler animations, push notifications, more robust Apple Watch integration, more data
                </p>
