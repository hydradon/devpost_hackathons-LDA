                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got our inspiration to develop the Health Counseling Portal from Sugar Labs and One Laptop Per Child, where we served in multiple capacities. Sugar Labs and One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) are organizations dedicated to create educational opportunities for the world's poorest children by providing each child with a rugged, low-cost, low-power, connected laptop (XO) with content and software designed for collaborative, joyful, self-empowered learning. As community engineers associated with this unique proposition, we have constantly evolved our skills to align ourselves with the mission statement and develop tools for educational and health purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Health and nutrition counseling and prevention from hospital acquired infections, preventive treatment and remediation over the ethereum blockchain network using a decentralized Twitter application, Embark tools and GenomeLink APIs for better understanding the genetic framework of the person. We can further utilize SocialCalc, Machine Learning Models coupled with UIPath Automation tools for analysis and prediction of diseases using Microarrays for providing early stage detection and treatment of health issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have developed the decentralized twitter application using Ethereum Blockchain framework, node.js framework, nvm, Embark tools following the tutorial -

                    </a>
                    We have taken considerable help in building the GenomeLink API app from the excellent examples provided. We are using HTML5 technologies and JavaScript framework for developing the frontend of the application and are using

                        https://github.com/genomelink/oauth-example-node-express
                    </a>
                    as the base for the development.
We experimented on utilizing OCR feature in UIPath Automation Suite and found that it could be utilized in sharing and extracting text from medical/health data. We use SocialCalc engine (Ethercalc) for data analysis, tabulation, computation and organization of data. Repository of EtherCalc can be found at

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been interested in building a health counseling, preventive treatment and remediation portal. We attended the first day workshop at EthIndia 2018 by Andy Tudhope this month, where he shared a decentralized twitter application and the utilization of Embark tools. We arrived at an idea that we could extend, adapt and utilize the example shared by Andy for building the portal using Ethereum blockchain network, IPFS for storage and Embark tools. 
We were able to follow the instructions with the help of Andy and fellow hacker friends at the ETHIndia 2018. However, when we completed the entire exercise of building the portal, Embark didn&rsquo;t run. We got key pointers on fixing it from Andy. We realized that Embark tools currently run at a specific version of nvm and were able to fix the issue. We felt elated and were able to resolve the issue just in time. This gave us immense confidence on completing the remaining parts of the solution and also strengthened our mission in extending, adapting and building on top of existing tools and solutions using quality mentorship and perseverance.
We twitted about Andy at our twitter channel
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/manusheel/status/1028244174565298176" rel="nofollow">
                        https://twitter.com/manusheel/status/1028244174565298176
                    </a>
                    so that we could encourage our friends to see the videos presented by him at EthIndia and build over Embark.
We also wish to mention that integrating and sending medical reports using NuCypher protocol required lot of mentorship from Bogdan Opanchuk and Dr. Michael from NuCypher. They helped us at every step of implementing NuCypher whether it was installing the correct versions of requisite libraries and tools and helping us running the re-encryption protocol. We wish to thank the EthIndia community and fellow participant hackers, who helped us learn and implement our idea in a fine way :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    We gained considerable knowledge on utilizing UIPath Automation Tools from Edureka, online repositories and forums and a wonderful open source community that stands with UIPath tools.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about GenomeLink API and its implications on understanding the DNA of a user, prescribing health solutions. This coupled with the research on utilizing machine learning models on predicting diseases by analyzing microarrays using the novel framework shared in the machine learning model (please visit - "Normalized Microarrays for Analysis and Prediction (NMAP): An SOA Solution for Biomedical Research", Pragya Goel, Manu Sheel Gupta, Proceedings of the International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, BIOCOMP 2010, Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S.A., CSREA Press 2010, ISBN 1-60132-143-0, pp. 304-309 ) along with UIPath Automation features like OCR and SocialCalc could help in early stage detection and prevention of diseases.

                    Our solution could be deployed at schools and universities. We wish to share the benefits of our solution -
                </p>
                <p>
                    Benefits to School: New and innovative health educational models being introduced everyday and technology supported health education is definitely one of the most successful educational models.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Benefits to Students: Our solution promotes sharing, collaborative learning, and reflection.  Students will learn to work together, enabling them to learn the importance of collaboration and team work at a young age. Students will become proficient in using the computer as a tool to engage in authentic problem-solving. Learners will be enthusiastically involved in the activities of the classroom. Further,  the blockchain solution records the healthcare tweet transactions. It will also enable instructors and parents to track the student&rsquo;s health issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Benefits to Instructors: Teachers will be able to give instructions in a more dynamic way, concentrating on each and every child. Students will enjoy learning and the teachers will enjoy mentoring them and learning along side them.  The solution can be helping in evaluating a child&rsquo;s health progress.  Instructors will have a richer classroom environment where children would willingly engage in health activities that are authentic to them.
