                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With all of the news stories coming out about trans people getting attacked or harassed in public bathrooms, we think the ability to find gender neutral bathrooms is vital for the community at large.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unicorn Poop would track the user's current location and allow them to submit their location as a geo-tag that marks a potential gender neutral bathroom. This would also include whether or not the bathroom is free for public use or if it requires money to access.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to create it with html and embedded javascript. We used Google App Engine to get an API that allows us to utilize location services. Implemented graphics were created using the adobe suite.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is brand new to web development, so most of this project was a challenge. Initially, understanding the relationship between the different programs in the stack was a hurdle to overcome. Then, we had troubles with properly utilizing Google API to our advantage. Finally, we came into the challenge of setting up a database and the communication pathways between the website and the database.

                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to come into this as newbies and still be able to work as a team to overcome the challenges we've faced.
