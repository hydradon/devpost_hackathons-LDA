                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spoke with the team from the JHU Technology Innovation Center about some of the problems hospitals currently face.  One problem they mentioned is how hard it is for doctors to manage the behavior of outpatients - specifically, their adherence to prescription schedules.  We feel motivated to help the medical field get up to speed with modern software applications, and would love to introduce easy to use tools into the space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QuickScripts is an easy and eye-catching way for doctors to manage their patients' prescriptions.  It sends out text reminders to help patients (especially geriatric patients) adhere to their prescription schedules.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After flirting briefly with Django, our team decided on a Python and Flask back-end. We employed Twilio to send the text messages, and wrote the front-end with Angular. We took advantage of Angular Materials to make the interface as beautiful as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript and Python don't always get along.  Our main challenge was syncing the front-end with the back-end and handling the data transitions in the HTTP requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The model, view, and controller are perfectly synced, it's lightning fast, and it's not too hard to look at. Thanks to Krisha and Zach, the database is well-designed and normalized level 3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zach never worked with Django or wrote a server before, and he led the way on the back-end.  Logan never used Angular before and contributed half of the front-end.  Yesh had experience with Angular, but learned more about the framework. He also got his first taste of Flask and Heroku with Python.  Krisha got her first big intro to web development and picked up on elements of all the tools involved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for QuickScripts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If executed properly, this model has a lot of potential.  If it could achieve HIPPA compliance, maintain it's speed, and extend it's core features, it could provide relief from the overloaded, dull, out-dated medical software that dominates the industry.
