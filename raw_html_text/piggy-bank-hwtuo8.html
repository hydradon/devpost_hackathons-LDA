                    The aim of the project is to reinvent the child bank account in order to aid children in learning how banking works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application will allow kids to redeem money from parents via completing tasks such as chores. This will be represented as virtual currency. Children can Withdraw and spend the money the same way as a real bank account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Children might be given a chance to invest their money into Companies or shares disguised as an avatar/ In game items which they can decide to keep and sell later for more money. The value for avatars/In game items can go up as time goes on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parents will be able to create and assign chores/jobs to their child/children giving each one a monetary value. This can then be redeemed via scanning a qr code created on the parents phone.
