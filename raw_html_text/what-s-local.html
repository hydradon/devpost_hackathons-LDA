                    leverages data from the USDA 2012 Census of Agriculture to explore local food systems for the 100 most populous urban areas in the lower 48 states. &ldquo;Local&rdquo; is defined as all counties having land within a 50-mi radius of each urban area&rsquo;s center point. Data are presented in two categories: 1) resource inputs, shown as dollars invested, and 2) agricultural outputs, shown as the mass of food, feed, and fiber produced in megagrams. Explore your city&rsquo;s local agriculture in comparison to other locations around the nation. This tool can help us envision the potential for, desirability of, and major challenges to future food system localization.

                    <em>
                        What's Local?
                    </em>
                    starts with an introductory sequence that establishes the project narrative and educates the user on relevant landscape patterns across the nation. This intro can be skipped if desired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The introduction leads to an interactive visualization tool. Leveraging data from the USDA 2012 Census of Agriculture, this visualization allows the user to explore local food systems for the 100 most populous urban areas in the lower 48 states. &ldquo;Local&rdquo; is defined as all counties having land within a 50-mi radius of each urban area&rsquo;s center point. Data are presented in two categories: 1) resource inputs, shown as dollars invested, and 2) agricultural outputs, shown as the mass of food, feed, and fiber produced in megagrams. For the latter, raw data available from the census were transformed to a common unit of mass using conversion factors based on USDA reports. All methods and data sources are thoroughly documented in the &ldquo;DataSourcesMethods.docx&rdquo; file linked on the project website (also copied in below).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can explore an interactive map of the lower 48 states that allows nationwide visualization of: a) county-level aggregated data (grey shades), and b) data for 100 urban areas and their local agriculture (circle sizes). These data layers can be selected by the user at the bottom left of main visualization page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can also select and zoom in to specific urban centers to explore their local agriculture. Hovering over inputs and outputs shows census items measured, and comparison of urban centers is facilitated by an option to switch between locations while staying in the zoomed-in format. Clicking on the background national map returns the user back to the national view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this tool, consumers can gain a deeper, data-based understanding of what&rsquo;s happening in their local food systems, and policy-makers and researchers can easily explore the heterogeneity in agricultural inputs and outputs near urban centers across the diverse U.S. landscape.

                                The mean national price of food size or market size catfish reported in the 2013 Aquaculture Census was $0.99 per LB. Using consumer price indices from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for meat, poultry, fish, and eggs (July 2013 and July 2012), it was estimated that the mean price of catfish in 2012 was $0.97 per LB. Therefore, it was estimated that 1.03 LBS of catfish were produced for every dollar in sales in 2012.

                                The weighted average national price in 2013 ($3.10 per LB) was estimated based on food size or market size prices and total values reported for bass, carp, tilapia, and other food fish in the 2013 Aquaculture Census. Using consumer price indices from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for meat, poultry, fish, and eggs (July 2013 and July 2012), it was estimated that the mean price in 2012 was $3.04 per LB. Therefore, it was estimated that 0.33 LB of fish in this category were produced for every dollar in sales in 2012.

                                These data were available by ERS Farm Resource Region. Therefore, values of milk produced (LBS) per dollar in sales (range = 4.32-5.23) were assigned to counties based on what ERS Farm Resource Region they are part of. When data were not available for a Farm Resource Region, the U.S. national average (4.72 LBS milk per dollar in sales) was used.

                                Vegetables were treated as a single aggregate class. State-level conversion factors (LBS per dollar in sales) were estimated using 2012 data for total vegetable production in cwt and total vegetables value in dollars, provided in the USDA NASS Vegetables 2014 Summary, released January 29, 2015.

                                State-level conversion factors were applied to all counties within a given state. When no data existed for a state, a conversion factor was estimated based on those existing for neighboring states. The conversion factors ranged from 12.07 LBS vegetables per dollar in sales (Illinois) to 1.6129 LBS vegetables per dollar in sales (New Hampshire).
