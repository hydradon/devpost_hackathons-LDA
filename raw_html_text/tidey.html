                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed a trend among online influencers that involved setting up mini beach and park cleanups, but it quickly died because it's hard to organize such events through Twitter or Instagram.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tidey allows users to scour the Earth (or their local communities) and pin locations with high amounts of garbage. Pins that have a net-positive amount of votes show up on the map, and anyone can reserve a time-and-date for their own clean-up event, which other people can RSVP for. Users can even bookmark events and look through photo galleries to see how other clean-ups turned out!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team built Tidey largely in Android Studio, using both the visual editor and Java. We also used Google Firebase to keep track of accounts that exist on the app (name, email, password).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was quite hard to understand Firebase at first, and it took several hours for us to be able to store multiple user accounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a non-computer science major (I personally have an Electrical Eng. background), this whole weekend has been a learning experience! I went from not having touched Android Studio ever, to feeling comfortable creating a basic app and learning more about databases and other back-end aspects needed to create a full-stack application. And for our CS majors Jackie, Justin, and Terence, this was a great foray into app development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We basically got a crash course in Android Studio and also learned a bit about Google Firebase. I also learned that teamwork takes and idea a lot farther than working solo!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tidey:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we'd like to fully flesh out tabs that we didn't get to finish, such as the Search feature where you can browse existing events by city, ecosystem, and date-and-time, and also have a clear, user-friendly process for uploading photos associated with their events.
