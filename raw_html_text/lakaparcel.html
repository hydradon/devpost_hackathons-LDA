                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a challenge with car parks in our local markets and usually most people do the shopping after working hours which end up creating a congestion and burning gas. So i want to solve this challenge by creating a Facebook messenger bot to help people pass orders any time of the day and we can deliver and i realized  that i will need different type of foods and there they are  a lot of people who are  trying to do a small side business but they have no time (especially those who work) and they can not find clients to sell to....That the reason i built LakaPercel to aggregate between buyers and the people who want to do a side business.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lakaparcel helps users to pass an order of local healthy foods at anytime of the day through messenger and get it delivered think of Lakaparcel as Amazon for local foods.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like AI and messaging apps i come across the 2017 Facebook challenge  but unfortunately i had not enough time to learn and build a messenger bot, never the less i decided to learn and build a messenger bot and for the 2018 Facebook challenge i decided to build a messenger bot to solve some challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had some challenges with back end algorithm cause the messenger bot API gives limited functionalities and the flow of the bot conversation to make it a simple as possible.
