                    We came up with the idea over a pint of beer. We decided to combine the things we love - music, gaming and our University. Platformer/rythmical game genre is a fairly unique one and we believe we realised it with witt and proficiency, given the working environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a fun and  challenging romp of a game. We play as a slightly awkward, geeky IT student, who suddenly gets a huge incentive to buy a bottle of wine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to make our project we had to create a load of 3d models using blender, then texture them and export to Unity, where we could set up the shaders. All the scripts were written in C# using Visual Studio tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was our first project developed using git. It, while helpful, also turned out to be quite a nuisance for newcomers. We have also struggled with overwhelming fatigue and strain, put on us by the ridiculous working hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are especially proud of our main character model. This fully 3d animated asset was painstakingly realised in a 14 hour-long crunch. In spite of a bunch of smaller and bigger bugs in our code, we have managed to develop a fully playable and enjoyable experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was the first hackaton of ours. During these exaggerating 48 hours we have learnt not only how to use specific programming tools to achieve our goals, but also cooperate (using git) and use the best of our advantages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I future, we would like to add additional difficulty levels and high score system, get rid of all the bugs and develop it on mobile platforms.
