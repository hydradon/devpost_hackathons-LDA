                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a constantly shifting technological world, mobile banking has been having trouble keeping pace. With all of our team members being members of various banks and credit union institutions, we have all experienced how our banks and credit unions have been slow to adopt the latest payment and innovative solutions available, in particular around usability, compared to the rest of the world. However, increasing usability should not come at the cost of security. We believe that Dash can answer that problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dash is a brand new, next generation mobile banking app to help users navigate their banking experience more easily. It accomplishes this by offering users the ability to converse with it as it is a conversational bot. When logging in, users have the option to securely access their accounts via
                    <strong>
                        unique voice recognition
                    </strong>
                    . Additionally, once logged in, a text chat with the bot can be opened to issue commands for checking balances, as well as transferring funds between accounts. However, we still provide users with a familiar banking experience, with information about current account funds available at the very top, as well as the ability to obtain info to contact your local branch.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was built as an Android mobile app that then connects to a variety of
                    <strong>
                        Flask
                    </strong>
                    microservices that are built with Python. The entire application is deployed in the cloud, with the aid of
                    <strong>
                        AWS Elastic Beanstalk
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        AWS RDS
                    </strong>
                    which provides us with
                    <strong>
                        PostgreSQL
                    </strong>
                    database services. While building the application, we also used
                    <strong>
                        Jenkins CI
                    </strong>
                    to auto-deploy and evaluate our builds from GitHub to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Natural language processing was handled by Microsoft's Cognitive Services, with following services:

                            : Towards the end of our development period, prior to testing, our AWS environment failed to deploy one of our essential microservices within an AWS EB instance. However, after a thorough investigation with various mentors and reverting commit messages, we discovered that SSLify manage to trudge through this enormous difficulty to finally deploy successfully.

                            As a result of having various microservices, it was challenging to ensure that all of them were communicating correctly not only with our application, but also between themselves. We found it was important to specify the input/output conditions of our APIs, and to communicate this clearly to our other team members.
