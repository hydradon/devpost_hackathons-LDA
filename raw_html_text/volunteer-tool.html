                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personally, I have struggled, as a grade 11 student, to find places to complete my 40 mandatory hours of volunteer experience. And after consulting with peers and researching online, I have concluded that I am not the only one with this problem. Thus, this idea was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using UPDATEABLE website data, it gets user inputs for their current position, in latitude and longitude, as well as which volunteering job they would like work at, such as community centres and animal shelters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application from scratch, using little to no API/networking/hardware knowledge, as we are beginners to the field. It was done using Java(JGrasp) with our problem solving/research/communication skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a variety of challenges. The biggest one was finding the ideal idea, as thinking of a unique solution to a social or environmental issue was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to maintain focus throughout the 14 hours of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technology can be used to create solutions to problems big or small. In addition, communication is key to efficient time management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Volunteer Tool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps a mapping feature that allows you to see the locations of the centres. In addition, a smoother user interface with a guide. Also, a feature where the application is more personalized with an agenda for the user.
