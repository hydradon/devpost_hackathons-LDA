                <p>
                    Modern gyms are not very accessible to people who are visually-impaired. So we hope to alleviate much of the dangers and stresses of going to the gym for exercising.

                    Proof of concept smart gym that is accessible to visually impaired people. Individuals would have access to smart earphones connected to a smartphone app (IoT system), the user would enter the gym and that entry point would be a reference point for the distance and availability of gym equipment. This would allow the user to navigate to equipment that is available and get them there safetly. Along with this, a user profile of the persons stats would be with them to better access certain workprofiles on various smart fitness devices. For our abstract proof of concept we demonstrated a simple smart treadmill that is voice operated. The user would be able to activate the treadmill and be guided through the various options and settings that they can request for verbally as well as some physical buttons for simple functions such as changing the incline angle or speed of the treadmill along with a safety system where pressure sensors would act to see if a user was in danger or fell

                    How I built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our abstract system was build with a simple Arduino and PC app connected system that is voice operated. The arduino is connected to leds where the blinking of the led lights can refer to different speeds or a multiple of leds can represent speed in binary. It is voice operated through microphone through a script made on C# and runs a C script on the Arduino IDE. There is also a website to represent the mobile app made with node.JS
