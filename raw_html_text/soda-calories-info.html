                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought that it would be nice if the information about the calorific value of sodas were easy accessible.
Most sodas have a lot of calories so everyone should have that in mind when drinking them.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One can tell the skill the name of the soda and it answers with the number of calories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it as a custom skill. I choosed the node.js version of the alexa skills kit, because i like node.js and it is the best documented version of ask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge was developing a skill in english because it is not my native language. Also the request/response json model in the alexa skills kit was a little hard to understand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Raising the awareness of health issues when drinking soda.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Correct use of the request/response scheme of the alexa skills kit.

                    What's next for Soda Calories Info
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be nice if the user would get the information, how much calories in comparison to other food the soda has.
