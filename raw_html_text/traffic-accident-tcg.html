                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to challenge ourselves to learn something completely new and create a working prototype in a short amount of time. We decided to use try to use the CDL data set for something fun
                </p>

                    It's Top Trumps..about car accidents

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the backend server using Node.js and Socket.io. We also used HTML and CSS for the frontend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd never set up a server before or made any games playable over the internet, so it was a big challenge for us to understand how these things worked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're very impressed with ourselves that somehow we've managed to make a workable game and worked with a large data set
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Manipulating data sets is harder than it looks! Also Node is cool :)
