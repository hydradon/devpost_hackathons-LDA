                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took a problem that many students face and decided to help students study effectively. Students often struggle to study efficiently given the time constraints. They are required to quickly find core ideas and their definitions and need to manually input and search for them into applications like Quizlet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application automates the studying process by taking images of notes and producing of set of flashcards containing key terms from the notes paired with their suggested dictionary definition. Students are allowed to quiz themselves and make edits to the suggested definition our application provides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our application with tools like AWS ML to extract text and detect key terms and APIs like Merriam-Webster to query for correct definitions. We used Vanilla JS, Node JS, and EC2 to simulate communications between client and server-side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult at first to set up AWS ML. This was our first time being exposed to this API and there was a lot of documentation and information we had to understand. We ran into many requirements errors, but as we continued to read the documentation we were able to more easily Amazon ML works. Towards the ends, we were able to use the new AWS API functions within 5-10 minutes. We also ran into a couple of problems deploying to EC2 regarding Node JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of understanding how Amazon ML works and how efficient and accurate its results were. It offers a lot of tools we can use for many different projects. We are proud that we were able to pull through with learning the API and new tools. We gained a lot of experience from this through trial and error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build an application using the Amazon ML API. We also further gained new knowledge with the tools we used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for QuizBucket
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QuizBucket wants to make key-word extraction from documents more accurate. We also want it to support more file types including .pdf, .docs, etc. Additionally, we want to improve the user experience by making things more intuitive and quick.
