                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Registering for classes can be very confusing, especially when the list of classes is hard to navigate and you have a complex schedule. With this program life gets a just bit simpler.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program prompts the user for a schedule ordered by importance. After that it prompts the user for their availability and then checks course availability, date and times the course is available, and its priority. A schedule is created and then displayed for the user.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using JavaFX we created a GUI with TextBoxes for the users courses, provided a sample course so they can emmulate its format, then prompted for their availability using radio buttons. Upon submission of availability a schedule is drawn up and presented on screen.
