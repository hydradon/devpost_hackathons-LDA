                    We love dogs and sometimes they get lonely without any friends, so we wanted to make an app where we could help them make some new friends.

                    We made it using java and android studio, we were all familiar with java but we don't normally use android studio so adjusting was a bit of a challenge but it was fun and we gained a bit of experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our future goals for Buddy Finder is to implement a way for it to detect stores and services targeted towards dogs, such as vet offices, pet stores, dog parks, etc.
