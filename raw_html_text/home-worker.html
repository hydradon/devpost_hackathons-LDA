                    How we built it

                    Using the

                    application SDK,
                    <em>
                        python
                    </em>
                    ,
                    <em>
                        flask API

                    <em>
                        Jinja2
                    </em>
                    and
                    <em>
                        JSON
                    </em>
                    . We first came up with a data structure to hold the various types of content and then worked on building out the voice experience. We decided on the voice interface patterns through a simple use case study and then began building out the rest of the features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The business question system is a different format to that of the other content, so we had the additional complexity of dealing with JSON documents for the quotes but questions were based in a Jinja2 template markup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One challenge was what not to include to ensure that the product remains easy and not too bloated. Just having a few main features makes the interface easier to navigate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another aspect is categorisation of our content correctly in the most suitable way. We want to the

                        life hacks

                    to be applicable where possible to people working from home to provide some simple guidance and lessons that they can apply easily wherever and whenever. Literally curating the content did take quite a bit longer than we anticipated.

Compiled quotes, and tips from business leaders which we think will have real impact on people working from home, collectively enhancing productivity and output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also like to think with the right tools such as Home Worker more people working from home means less traffic and less pollution and environmentally friendly. No more trips to the office in a polluting car.
