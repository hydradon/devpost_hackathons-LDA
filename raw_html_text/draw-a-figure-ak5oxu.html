                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Benetech's vision of incorporating interactive math learning to students.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Benetech Lab's beta-program MathShare, Draw-A-Figure is a stand-alone widget allowing for students and educators to choose from a library of shapes, input specific parameters, and automatically generate those shapes on a graph.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were asked to use vanilla HTML/CSS/Javascript to create the widget that Benetech can use. We utilized HTML Canvas and CSS for the visual aspects including designing the button layout, color theme, and shape.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced many challenges individually and as a team. This is the first time that any of us had use any of these languages. This was also all of our first hackathons. We had to learn a lot in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled, we shed tears, but we persevered. We managed to learn and incorporate three different languages and connect them to each other in a meaningful manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code for the first time in HTML, CSS, and JS. We also learned the weird thing that in JS, 100 + 100 = 100100. Interesting. We also learned how fun it is at Hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Draw-A-Figure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Streamlining graphs and using SVG to create the shapes. Add more shapes and show more properties of them.
