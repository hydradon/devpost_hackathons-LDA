                    Conway's game of life is a 0 player game based on a self generating automata that self generates based on a set of rules. We adapted it to mobile devices that allows players to create/kill cells. It is based on a distributed system where players can arbitrarily join an existing game and propagate their effects to the ongoing game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The actual game runs in the server and all events on mobile devices are propagated to it via web socket based communication. The changes are broadcast-ed to all the connected users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The server side is written in python and runs on a django instance that uses channels to establish a mutliuser-chat based protocol. The events on android are sent to the server and server projects the game at a rate of 10FPS.
This means each second the game state is updated 10 times and the state is broadcast-ed to the connected devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the client side, we used LiveData architecture provided by android to optimally render about 10^3 image views/second.
