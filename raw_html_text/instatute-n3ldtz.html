                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being students in a busy life, we know how hard it is for us to manage our schedules and be in touch with our teachers. So, we thought it would be best to integrate both of these things using a Web App.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It does several things. It allows for both teacher and student login, gives an easy way to pick our time table by using Google's distance matrix API, and also check grades.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and attempted to use PyQt to make an interactive webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being beginners in programming, the biggest problem we had to tackle was the use of APIs. We had several problems finding the keys and secrets, but in the end, we figured it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our achievements regarding the file management system and the algorithm developed, as it is an intricate system that can store and sort through files, and the algorithm never fails to provide an optimal solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly learned how to use APIs, and also learned more about PyQt and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Instatute
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instatute can be developed with a front end interface, which can make it easier to use and more appealing to the eye.
