                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was bored in SWEN-261 and thought about space on Friday
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simulation of gravity in 2-d space with ships (gravity-less) and planets (gravity wells)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A backend model in Java with many vector calculations and runtime efficiency improvements with a chunk system that needs very few calculations to simulate
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most bug-prrone area was the GUI element because we used Java Swing, which we were pretty inexperienced in using. Most of the backend code happened to work almost bug-free when the main tests were ran.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very proud of the backend, especially considering it was conceptualized on friday, and completely implemented here at Brickhack. Also the GUI element feels super good because we actually have something to show for our work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons are really fun, and somehow get a lot of stuff done fast. Also some team coordination skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gravity Bomb
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend implementation in C for faster calculations, an a more efficient UI system for higher framerates.
                </p>
