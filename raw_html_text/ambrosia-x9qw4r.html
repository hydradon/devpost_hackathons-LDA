                <p>
                    Our mission is to empower local farmers and help them get their products the recognition they deserve. This tool allows them to advertise their foods on the web, and have them directly delivered to the consumers. That means more money goes into the pockets of local farmers, and customers are treated to fresh produce brought right to their door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, cutting out the need for supermarkets means far less gas is used in the transportation of these products, resulting in a far lighter carbon footprint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With our continued focus on creating a more and more efficient system, we hope to inspire more people to support local farms throughout the years to come..
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this website, local farmers in Quebec can enroll their farm in our online marketplace and sell their products directly to consumers. Fresh vegetables, fruits, and dairy and maple products are posted online, and buyers can have their desired foods delivered right to their door.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html and css to design the website. We used php and JavaScript to code the back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems with coding the part that calculates the total sum of a client's purchase. There were just too many variables of different value to code all of it in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the finished product. It is a functioning prototype. The website is very complete and the idea has grand potential.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to code with css and JavaScript, as well as how to create a complete website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We would like to complete the app, and eventually put it on the real market. We really believe in the potential of this website and the limitless possibilities of the market in hand.
