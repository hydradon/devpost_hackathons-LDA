                    Changing habits is very complicated especially when it comes to technology, but if 
technology is that hard to overcome, why don't we use it against itself? recursive thinking, isn't it?

                <p>
                    In order to deal with it, we decided to create a web platform associated to a PWA application. It's 
about putting articles from different fields and push people to read them.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each field got a series of
questions to be answered so the user can evaluate his knowledge in the specific discipline.
We added a family option, a parent can add his kids so they can read articles and take questions 
separetly, with a system of competition between family members to encourage them to always read more and more.
