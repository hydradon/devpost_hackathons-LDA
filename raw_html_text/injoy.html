                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea was inspired by the fact that we came to Georgia Tech as exchange students. We had a hard time integrating to the new environment. Hence, we came out with a thought of helping people in general make new friends through the means of eating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first time launching this app, it will automatically know your preferences / hobbies. When you are going to dine alone in a restaurant, you can get matched with another person to dine together. During the dining session, it must be very awkward, meeting a new person, who does not know anything about you. This is where our second feature of our app goes into place, it suggests you a list of news headline and helps you kick start the conversation with a topic you are interested and familiar with. Result: no more awkwardness :)

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Facebook's graph API to know a person's favorite activity,  preferences, and hobby. We process those data to produce a list of conversation topics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facebook's graph API is a pain in the ass :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's real fun when our hidden 'interests' were known among ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need more exposure to APIs :(
                </p>
