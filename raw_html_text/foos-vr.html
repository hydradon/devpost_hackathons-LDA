                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Foosball is a beloved game within our team, and when the idea came up to make a virtual version of it we couldn't resist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using two Myo armbands you can control your foosball players, simulating the familiar actions of a foosball table. Play against a tricky AI with killer control over the ball.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges &amp; Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Separating the pitch and roll actions of the Myo armband and translating that into the appropriate movement across the screen was definitely the biggest challenge. As this was our first time using the Myo armbands, we are pleased with the results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VR Foos
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Putting the game online, and making it truly multiplayer would be the next big step we would love to take. Better calibration for a more intuitive gameplay is also important to us.
