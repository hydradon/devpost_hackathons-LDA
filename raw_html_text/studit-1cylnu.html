                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something every student needs. While universities provide a lot of help to students, we knew that students still need help finding help among other students, especially new students who still haven't quite met anybody yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This platform allows students to input their own information and what courses they are in, and it matches them with other students in the same course. Along with this, it allows the students to talk via the chat function, and even allows them the create groups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we created a website from the ground up using HTML, CSS, and JS. We used Firebase in order to store user data and allow for efficient authentication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Of course, the biggest challenge we ran into was learning the web development platform, and frameworks such as react. We ran into issues regarding how to set up the website, and figuring out which frameworks were needed. We began using Spring Boot, but it ended up failing, which is why we switched to firebase.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that despite the incredible learning curve, we created an idea that we are all proud of. I am also proud of how we learned.
