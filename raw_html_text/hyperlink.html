                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Boredom strikes everyone. From time to time, the four of us find that nearly nothing passes the time. Activities like the Wikipedia Game become dull and repetitive after a few playthroughs. The Wikipedia Game, however, did present an interesting premise, and so the thought in our group went, "what if we expanded it to the entire web?" Hence, HyperLink, which doesn't constrain the players to a single domain, and allows for a fluid system of competition with friends.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HyperLink is a Chrome extension that allows users to competitively play against each other to see who can find the most occurences of a single word on multiple websites throughout the Internet.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JavaScript and HTML to build this Chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With three of the four of us having no experience with JavaScript, none of us having much or any experience with HTML, and this being the first Chrome extension any of us has worked with, there were a lot of technical hurdles that we had to surpass to create HyperLink. Mostly, it was the syntax and some of the concepts that we had trouble putting into the code that gave us the most issues.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we learned a good deal of JavaScript and HTML while here at MHacks, and that we created a completely different project than anything we've done before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use JavaScript and HTML, as well as the basics behind creating Chrome extensions.

                <h2>
                    What's next for HyperLink
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A better matchmaking system and rank points are what we would like to add next to HyperLink.
