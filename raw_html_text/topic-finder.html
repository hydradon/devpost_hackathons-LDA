                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find a way to connect multiple platforms of social media to a single site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Topic Finder takes a keyword inputted by the user and prints the top results from certain social media websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Topic Finder was built using Python, a YouTube API, a Reddit API, and html for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into were figuring out flask, discovering how to use different APIs, using the Facebook API, connecting front end with back end, taking and printing the results from YouTube and Reddit onto our website, and designing the website to make it easier for the user to read.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to take on a considerably tough project and be able to complete it. We were also able to cooperate and input different perspectives that elevated our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement both Python and Flask to send and receive user input. We were able to find out how to take results from our python file and transfer it to our result html file for display. We also learned more about APIs and how to use them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Topic Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more APIs to our project and implement more search filters. Also add the YouTube videos to our site.
