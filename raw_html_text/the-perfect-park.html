                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few of our friends are theme park enthusiasts and wanted to figure out how to determine which park would be the best park for them to attend on any given day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes in several different conditions about theme parks in the Orlando-Tampa area and determines which park would be the best to attend on any given day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Cloud Platform to create a VM. That VM held our database for the information we wanted to handle from the parks. We were going to use various APIs to gather data about theme parks and populate the database. Also, we planned on making a python program that would be responsible for determining which park would be the best to attend. We wanted to add Google Home integration using Dialog Flow to create several prompts and responses. Finally, we hosted a website on our VM as well that could give all the information we gathered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the APIs we wanted to use were depricated or no longer supported by their developers. We decided to pivot towards using scrapers on a few web pages to collect the data, however issues arose when we tried to install the necessary software onto our VM. Along with that, We had difficulty understanding how to use Google's APIs to gather the necessary information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully setup a website for our project. 
We made and populated a Database.
We created a comprehensive agent for calling Google Home intents.
We had tons of fun!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about APIs 
We learned how to scrub through forums to try and find answers to tough questions.
We learned about Python and Javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Perfect Park
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group would like to see if we can integrate an API with the system to get some data and create the program that would determine which park is the best to go to.
