                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's been many times when we would forget our password and have to go through the hassle of recovering it and creating a new one just to forget it weeks later. In an age where every handheld device has facial recognition, why not make old school websites have the same feature and get rid of passwords altogether.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web-app was made to have those who forget their passwords in mind. The basis is instead of logging in using a boring and forgetful username and password, you just use your face to get into whatever account you are trying to access. This allows you to have a one of a kind key for access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use Microsoft Azure's cognitive recognition API's at first before we realized the mountainous task ahead of us. We originally had a four man group which near the end dropped to two due to members disappearing without a trace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being rookie coders, getting the website up and running and dynamic was a feat within itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about APIs and how they can be utilized as well as website creation and creative thinking in order to get past hurdles such as bad and missing code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Facemates
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would be to get some sort of secondary login working for times when facial recognition doesn't work. Also, it would be a great step to get actual facial recognition software working hand in hand with our web-app.
