                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As software developers, we spend a lot of time at a keyboard - and this time puts stress on our bodies that can lead to Carpal Tunnel Syndrome if we are not careful. We designed a system using Leap Motion that can help users become aware of their posture while typing through an interactive typing game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app consists of a typing game where the user enters falling words. The LeapMotion tracks the user's hands over the keyboard. If the user is in a bad position, a tone is played and the hand begins to turn red in the problem area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity for GUI, python and SciKitLearn and RandomForest for Machine Learning on detecting compromising hand positions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we planned on using Python for our entire app, but Leap Motion no longer supports Python with the V4 SDK. Because of this, we were required to use Unity and C# for our main app development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creativity in creating the stand for the leap motion. Integrating an open source typing game as a demonstration tool.
