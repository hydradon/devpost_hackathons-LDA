                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Jahmal Cole's story and formyblock.org. We realized that people don't interact or even know their own neighbors. We knew that a lot of people utilized Facebook groups to connect with people that have the same interests as them but people these days do not attempt to get to know their own neighbors that physically live so close to them. We took the idea of Love Thy Neighbor to heart and knew that this would be a great way to bring people that live next to each other, closer together. This is a great platform for them to connect and stay connected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an end-to-end application that allows block club leaders to add information that will display on dashboards, user profiles for all block club members including the leader, events for the leader to add and members to have access to as well as fundraisers that the leader would like to plan on having. There is also a donate feature for others to donate to that particular block.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end using ReactJS and the back-end using Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with integration of the front-end and back-end. We also had trouble obtaining real-time data for our map and location feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of having a web application that can easily be integrated to formyblock.org. A block leader could use this app for all the management and organization tasks of the club. A block member could easily navigate to this application and find information as well as stay connected with their neighbors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of our front-end and our UI/UX of the application. We spent a lot of time on the user experience and the way a block club leader would want to use this application. We also attempted to create the web application interface clean and easy to use as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many tech skills such as developing a back-end which was new to some of us or going in-depth into the front-end. We also learned many soft skills such as collaboration, time management, teamwork and delivering in a short amount of time under a lot of pressure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for myBlock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to see this integrated onto formyblock.org. We would love to see block club leaders utilizing these features and block members accessing it to stay connected to the people on their block. We would love to work with Jahmal and the people from formyblock.org so that they have an easier time helping people create block clubs and utilize the power they have through uniting to its full potential.
