                    How I built it

                <p>
                    To begin, I built a simple prototype of the application using Axure (that my first time using the software, and I love it!). This gave me a way to test out my idea of using a series of questions to build a "Lunch App Wizard." I shared the link with my classmates and coworkers and collected feedback. I continued to improve the Axure prototype, incorporating suggestions and fixing errors as my users reported their test results.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Andrew jumped in at that point and Bootstrap-ed my Axure prototype. Armed with a working mockup of the user interface, we charged into complete more usability testing. We adjusted colors, layout, and question types based on what we learned. After that, I got to the hard stuff...coding.
