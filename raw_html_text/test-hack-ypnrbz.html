                    This is an html hack for hackBCA III - A simple web site built with html about myself.
                    <br>
                    It's the "new and improved" version of an html site I programmed over
                    <em>
                        3 years ago
                    </em>
                    , and I'm very happy with the progress.  Upon doing this hackathon, I realized that nothing was motivating me to make something highly technical, but I still had the power of web design to guide me.  To me, creating art is central to my self-expression, and a site having a good design is also important to me while surfing the web.  Most sites nowadays are business-oriented, whether people make revenue off of advertisements or are selling a product.
                    <strong>
                        Why can't we build more sites that are just about ourselves?
                    </strong>
                    This site is
                    <em>
                        pseudo-interactive
                    </em>
                    , meaning any interactions placed on the site don't actually go anywhere.
