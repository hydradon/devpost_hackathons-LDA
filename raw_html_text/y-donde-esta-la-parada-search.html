                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Public transport is a big problem in our  community, amongst other problems related to it the transport routes aren't even mapped and online yet, therefore not available too us, the citizenz. We wanted to help solve this problem through our own skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows 6 (only for the demo, the plan is to map all the routes) of the most common routes for public transport in our city which we mapped and display for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We manually mapped the routes taking the coordenates for the nodes that belong to the routes through google maps. 
We created a demo app with Angular.js and HTML5 also using the google maps API to show theese routes.

                <p>
                    Lack of experience and lack of organization at times. 
Lack of knowledge in some of the technologies we used.
