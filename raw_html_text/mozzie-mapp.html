                            Define the problem you are seeking to solve.
Mozzies are not going away; it is us who have moved into their home. 
Mozzies here on campus are an irritant that we must adapt to. 
Our knowledge of Mozzie encounters on campus is general or anecdotal at best. 
Our team seeks to Mapp Mozzie human interactions on campus. 
We are focused on creating a system for collecting data in order to gain a clear understanding of the nature of the problem. 
By analysing the data collected we can create a Mozzie Mapp.
A systematic approach to the problem is needed in order to plan how to co-exist in a cost-effective manner.

                            Describe your big idea (what is the vision?).
We plan to create a version of Live traffic NSW for Mozzies on campus.
We plan to put numbers to our current anecdotal knowledge. 
We plan to create an internal data collection system using resources at hand.
                            <br>
                            Our system will be used internally by IFS to prove our concept, then if successful rolled out to all users of the campus.

                            Describe and illustrate (if possible) your proposed solution.
Our proposal will utilise crowd sourcing and data analysis, in a simple system designed to collect information on human interaction with Mozzies on campus and create a &ldquo;Mozzie Mapp&rdquo;. 
Mozzie Mapp will facilitate the application of targeted best practice mozzie control strategies to be implemented by the University by providing an assessment tool for analysing the effectiveness of any strategy implemented.
Our team will implement a system of targeted data collection on mozzie/human interaction to map the mozzie problem internally, with assistance of IFS staff as users to collect data as mandated by management. 
This approach will minimise the risk of reputational damage to the university by announcing the problem to potential international student base.

                            What is the core foundation of your research or solution (this could be technology, research, know-how etc)?
To solve this problem, we need the data. 
The core of our solution is to leverage the resources of the University to approach the problem with an internal focus. 
We aim to work together with IFS to provide real data on the existing Mozzie problem on campus, and to provide a tool to asses intervention strategies. 
We do not want to draw an undue amount of attention to the issue which carries a reputational risk to the institution.

                            Describe who you think your end-user and/or paying customer could be.
In the initial stage of the project, IFS will be the customer/user of the system. 
IFS have and continue to implement Mozzie interventions, relying only on anecdotal evidence of the effectiveness of each strategy. 
The Mozzie Mapp will offer IFS a new tool for intervention planning and importantly a tool for assessment of their interventions. 
Once a proof of concept system has been implemented successfully in conjunction with IFS, the system can then be rolled out to the generally public via the mozzie mapp.

                            Describe your Technology Readiness Level or Research Literature Level.
We plan to simplify the initial design stage by leveraging the capabilities of IFS internal to the University. In this proof of concept stage, users (staff) will be mandated by management to provide the required data to build a picture of the Mozzie issue on campus.
In this early stage, data collection will be achieved with a simple automated sms system internally among IFS staff. 
Upon successful internal implementation further development would be required to roll out an app to all users of the campus.

                    From a preliminary review of literature, we know:
&bull; Mozzies have been a major issue on site since work on the campus began in 1966.
&bull; That the last time a survey by Hunter Health of the Mozzie population on campus was in 2010. 
&bull; The School of Architecture used students to map Mozzies in 2018 on a limited scale.
&bull; Researchers in the School of Medicine and public health have recently used a system to map influenza virus using a crowd sourced data driven approach, with great success.

                    <li>
                        Describe the top three critical hypothesis you want to explore, including: 
&bull; Can we build an internal system to quantify mozzie/human interaction in conjunction with IFS to assess the effectiveness of intervention strategies in order to and provide a tool to implement the most cost-effective control strategies in the future?
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    &bull; Can we assess the human behaviour of the users of the system at an initial stage in which all users are mandated by management to participate in the project, in order to gain insights to be applied if the system is rolled out to all users of the campus?
                </p>
                <p>
                    &bull; Can we demonstrate the design, logistics and benefits of Mozzie Mapping to the University internally, and then extend the system to general users of the campus in order to showcase local innovation to a larger audience?
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Describe how would use funding to progress your hypotheses, including:
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    &bull; How will the work described be performed within the budget (up to AU$5,000) and time period (6months) allocated for the testing phase (resources, capability etc)?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Funds will be used in the initial stage to cover costs of basic automated sms data collection system, data processing and visualisation, along with costs incurred by the university to mandate staff to collect data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &bull; What essential outcomes will you generate during your testing phase?

                    Proof of concept of our data driven approach to map mozzie problem on campus internally. 
Understanding of human behaviours using the technology and what can be expected from a public rollout. 
Provide IFS with the tools required to make a difference on campus.

                <p>
                    Budget pricing of cost allocation is as follows:
30% technical costs &ndash; automated sms sdata collection system, data visualisation/reporting
70% staff cost offset to IFS to ensure required amount of data is collected.

                </ol>
                <p>
                    To date, we have assembled a team of uon undergraduates and staff with diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise.
We have refined our idea from the initial concept of a public facing app, with reliance on incentives to gain users, to an internal business facing approach of working with IFS to prove our concept, while minimising the reputational risk to the university by drawing attention to the issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have participated in initial discussions with IFS representatives on the concept and the response has been very encouraging at this stage.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Why your idea is an unconventional or creative approach to the problem
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The core of our idea is to work internally within the university system, leveraging the existing capabilities on campus here on campus to solve a well-known problem, without drawing undue external attention which carries a reputational risk to the university. 
We aim to prove our concept internally, then if proven successful to roll out our solution to public users of the campus, which is an excellent opportunity to showcase what we can achieve as a university. 
Our approach is to first understand the problem in detail, rather than jumping in to the implementation of a solution, for which we know there are many approaches.
