                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a game that i thought not many people would make, and wanted to be ale to finish it on time.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are a blue car, you use WASD, or the arrow keys to move, and you drive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was doing it in C, but then I realized maybe i should do it in Java, so i made it in Java.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *The background kept going over the car, so you can't see the car.
The car, and the background would open in 2 different windows.
