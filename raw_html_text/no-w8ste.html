                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone who has ever lived with a group of people knows the fridge-struggle. Who has opened the milk? When was it opened? Can I still drink it or will it strangle me as soon as I open it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are awesome!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the current version, you can tell the assistant that you've opened a product. It will save that in a database
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected the Google Assistant with a Node JS Backend hosted on Firebase. The user input is checked with a food API, to be secure, that only valid food can be stored to the NoSQL Database Firestore.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Firebase without paying for it and interacting with the firestore database
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating Firebase and have an awesome usecase. We are really looking forward to use our app after the hackathon.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to build a Google Action, how to use dialogflow, how to use Firebase
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for freshUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next up is the integration of a user management system to figure out who has opened which good. Furthermore, an AI is going to be added to be able to evaluate when a new product is most likely to be opened or in which time period a product will become inedible.
