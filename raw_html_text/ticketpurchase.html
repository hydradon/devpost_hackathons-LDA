                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over 10 years ago, I build a kiosk application where moviegoers could by tickets (in a theatre) without the assistance of a sales person.  It took me many months to build in Java, using Swing-classes and everything.  I was wondering how long it would take on LM, even branching out to other theatres and including an travel external distance calculator
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on a specified Zip Code it determines which theatre is the closest to you.  It then displays which movies play at that theatre, so you can select one of those movies and purchase tickets (children must be accompanied by an adult to see an "R" rated movie
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of trial-n-error and I took major advantage of the new tablerule import feature
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time I used "Connectors" and looping!  Connector responses are unpredictable and I received many "500 Server Errors" that are difficult to debug in the LM environment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I implemented recursive looping through al theatres using a single connector
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to do this with available LM features requires a non-traditional approach to application development.  So far, I had only done basic forms and validations, but now I can add Connectors to my LM experience
                </p>
