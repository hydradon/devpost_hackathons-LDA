                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the number of people that have diabetes due to problems with their pancreas. We created something that could potentially save lives detecting any unusual change in the outline of the pancreas is easier to detect even though it is hard to access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program provides pixel level annotation of the pancreas in order to grant the user with the segmentation using the uploaded image. In other words, the program detects the outline of the pancreas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using python for running the image through the model in addition to using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, flask framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We, as a team, successfully used flask frameworks and python in our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about Python and how to use Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pancreas Segmentation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add a database to store the uploaded images and get the program to compare them in order to detect if there is any variation in the outline of the pancreas that a patient has to be aware of.
