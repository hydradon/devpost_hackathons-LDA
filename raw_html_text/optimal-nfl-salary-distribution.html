                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a passionate Business Intelligence Analyst and Football Fan.  Every time a team decides to sign, or not to keep, a player, there is a wide range of reactions and criticism.  It is often difficult to differentiate between team mismanagement and strategic management.  I aimed to build a model I have never seen before in my years a a fan- a machine learning model that analyses the best salary cap distribution needed to maximize regular season wins.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyses relationship between percentage of salary cap allocation among starters and regular season wins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Proprietary data set.  I obtained salary information for every team for the past five years, calculated their salary cap percentage of team's total cap, and flagged starters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create and analyze Machine learning models in R (decision tree, random forest, and multiple linear regression).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create dashboard to see and interactive with results.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Obtaining data.  The data set I needed was not publicly available.  Only part that was available was the salary information, but I need to calculate their salary as a percentage of the total and flag starters based on my personal football knowledge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Models were off at first.  Made a small error creating initial data set.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Analyzing Machine Learning models is inherently time consuming
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    <li>
                        Learned something about football I did not previously know.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a brand new NFL related data set I can share with others.

                    <li>
                        Something I did not realize until I had done this exercise is that EXTERIOR offensive linemen are crucial to the success of a team whereas INTERIOR offensive linemen are surprisingly the least important position.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I learned how to integrate multiple machine learning models into a single R dashboard.
                    </li>

                        Continue to polish.  My goal is to be able to produce a product that is useful to someone who knows nothing about statistics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Apply my models to teams after the free agency ends and the NFL draft takes place.  I will be using them throughout next season to help me out in fantasy football!
