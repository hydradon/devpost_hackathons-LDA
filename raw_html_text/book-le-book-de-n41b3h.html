                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Despite growing online markets for discounted books, the average cost of textbooks and novels has risen four times faster than the rate of inflation over the past 10 years. That has caused 65 percent of people to skip buying required texts or novels of their interest at some point in their life because of a lack of affordability. This app allows a person to lend and borrow books.

                    An interactive app which allows the user to lend and borrow books. A person can add his/her book to the app that he/she wants to lend and also can borrow from others. This will help the user to save money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ## How it works
Initially:
-This app will let the user add books he/she would like another person to borrow, his/her address and contact details, ask him/her to add his genre to it.
-A user can borrow books made available by others.
-The minimum time period to lend books is 1 week.
-The app will have a chat box to make friends and meet people having the same interest in books as he/she has.
-First-time sign-ups will get some ebooks free.
-If a person is able to lend 3 books in a month, he/she will get a free book from a budding author. [as a gift from our side]
-Borrowed books will be circulated within city of user`s residence.
-The person who borrows the book has to pay the delivery charges.

                <p>
                    Afterward:
-Introduction of points-
 *A person who lends a book gets 20 points
 *Refer 5 friends-10 points
 *When 100 points collected free book from our side [of a budding author]
-Ewallet like paytm, etc will be used as a payment gateway for all transactions.

                <p>
                    Later on:
-Collaboration with Amazon`s ebook
-When a user has lent 20 books in a year and collected 1000 points, gets to choose any three books and we will provide any one of the three books free of cost.
