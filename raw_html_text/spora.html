                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realised one of the causes of brain drain in emerging markets is that skilled Nigerian graduates do not have job opportunities available to them in the country, therefore, they are forced to leave to foreign markets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a platform from which Nigerian diaspora can contribute to job opportunities in Nigeria by outsourcing business process services to Nigerian graduates in Nigeria whilst also reducing their operating costs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a chatbot to make the Whatsapp project management and Adobe XD to mock up the website UX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to ensure that we were able to find educated skilled graduates that had the necessary skills to contribute to perform the work to a high level. Therefore we had to think solutions to assess whether graduates had the correct skills and provide opportunities to develop soft skills.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to come up with a simple product that curbs brain drain in Nigeria
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of developing business solutions that use technology rather than technology solutions.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue developing the product
