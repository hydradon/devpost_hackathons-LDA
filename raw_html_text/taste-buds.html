                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we often ask our friends for food recommendations. We end up writing them somewhere on our phones, but don't necessarily check them when we go out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app has three views:
1- A dashboard, showing you where your friends have been and their latest activity
2- A profile page, where you can see your profile and your entries
3- A map, where you can see where your friends have been
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can add a food recommendation using the "Check in" button. You add the name of the restaurant, a picture of your food and a rating: not worth it, kinda worth it, totally worth it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift 4.0, the Google Maps SDK, the Facebook SDK and Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble integrating Swift with the Google Cloud Database. We eventually pivoted to Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our UX designer made mockups in a day for most of the app.
One of our teammates doesn't know Swift and was still able to help us in the backend.
We did not all know each other before the hackathon and we were still able to deliver an app with the three views we had imagined.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the integration between Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods is relatively complicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Taste Buds
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue developing the app by adding more features:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        List feature: sort some food recommendations by theme, and let the user make lists (coffee shops, ice-cream places, etc...)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Search bar
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ability to follow users
We mostly want to get it into the hands of users and hear what they have to say!
