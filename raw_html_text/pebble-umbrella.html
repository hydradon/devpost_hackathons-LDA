                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's plenty of weather apps out there that'll provide all the information about the weather but fail to address a simple question. Do I need to take an umbrella today?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our motivation is to provide user the with the information they want, to answer their concern with a glance at their watch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app currently only provides information for rain, however we plan to add predictions for cold weather (display warm clothes to the user), snow and other types of weather.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is simple.
It's a watchface that uses the openweathermap.org api to check if it will rain today. If rain is expected, the watchface shows an umbrella. Otherwise, its just a regular watchface that shows the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app is fully functioning. It has not been uploaded to the store yet however.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Adding images with the pebble.js api posed problems that were difficult to debug and drained a lot of our time.

                <p>
                    Our team was working on two projects, which retrospect we think was a bad decision :P However we managed to accomplish a working prototype for both. Had we concentrated on one, we could have provided a product with more
