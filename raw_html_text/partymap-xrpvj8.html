                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided that we wanted an easier way to see fun and free things around campus for students here at UF. This would offer a streamlined solution to invites and meetups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application allows users to see nearby events (along with some details) on a map as well as post events of their own for others to see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Maps API, developing applications for the web and for android. This involved writing in Java in Android Studio, as well as writing in HTML, CSS, and javaScript for the web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems with our android emulators (none of us have androids) working correctly with Android Studio. On top of this, it was very difficult to get location services working on the emulator. This led to our creation of the web app, meaning we now support two platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we successfully developed with an API that we had never worked with before. We are also proud that even though we have very little web and UI experience, our web application turned out great.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Google Maps API, an API that will surely prove useful in the future. We also learned how to develop with HTML, CSS, and javaScript all-together to create a functioning website that interacts properly with users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CollegeMaps?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We see CollegeMaps as a platform for more than just partying. Another area we are excited about is free stuff! All college students (and everyone) loves free stuff, and this app would be an amazing way to broadcast opportunities to fellow students. We are also considering adding a maps-based study solution for students to meet each other and study the same classes.
