                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a program to warn us when we use too much of a single word
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    reads an input text file completely, makes a list of all the unique words used, and sorts them by how frequently they are used. A link to a thesaurus entry for that word is displayed next to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used parallel vectors to store the strings and the amount of times the words were used. We sorted them using selection sort and made sure to ignore punctuation marks next to the words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    logic behind filling in the vectors with info from the text file

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a working program
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
