                    Concept
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ChitChat is an Image, Video, and Text sharing platform that utilizes snapchats self deleting content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ChitChat connects to SnapKit which allows users to use snapchat to upload videos and images to ChitChat
                </p>
                <p>
                    Allows users to comment on content uploaded through text and bitmojis
                </p>
                <p>
                    All content uploaded to ChitChat would be deleted after 24 hours
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can tag their content using hashtags allowing you to search for popular topics and trends (E.g. #worldcup would give back all content with that tag)
                </p>

                    Problems Faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When trying to use Snap Kit there was an issue with the usage of the applications page where we needed to connect the different developement kits to our application. It would not save our selection of tool kits or our list of demo user accounts. This lead to us being unable to progress further into the developement. With this issue and the struggle we were having converting the limited web examples of the Snap Kit Tools it made progress to be extremely difficult.

                    The "front" page where you see the most popular posts. You could search the posts based on their tags and their user. Potentially from here you could create your own post. This would either allow for a upload from your snaps or take a photo or video using your webcam and Snap Chat filters.
