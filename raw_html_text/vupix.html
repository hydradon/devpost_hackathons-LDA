                </h2>
                <p>
                    My project attempts to give the Vuzix Blade the functionality of a remote for the camera built into the connected Android device.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with the app for the Android device (in this case, being my phone) and then created the app for the Vuzix Blade. As I needed something to interface with before proceeding, I found this to be the most logical course of action.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the nature of the proprietary software, as well as the recent release of the Blade, there were expected difficulties with getting it to connect and interact with the device correctly. In addition to this, I am decently new to Android Studio, so view handling and the different libraries available to me certainly took a decent chunk of time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, this is the first hackathon of 3 that I am truly proud of my work. I dove into working on an app, with unfamiliar hardware to boot, and now have a decent grasp of both. While I did not get it to the functionality level that I was hoping for, showing the possibilities of this technology makes me really happy. In addition to this, I had prolonged conversations with some of the employees of Vuzix, expanding my network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of what I learned came in the app development front. More than anything else, I learned a bit about how to navigate through APIs, and how Android apps build themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VuPix
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it so that it can control the app from the get-go would be really cool, but also require more calls that I am not sure I can do on my own.
