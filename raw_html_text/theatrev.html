                    Our team was lucky to come together with such a variety of talents. Bryce was the founding father of TheatreV, but his idea has been reshaped many times thanks to Vish playing devil's advocate, always asking "so, what is really INNOVATIVE about this?" What began as a business model for a VR network of 3D cameras for event spaces has evolved through our varying bases of knowledge into a multi-user, completely customizable experience, that we truly believe is innovative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the user puts on the Oculus hardware, TheatreV transports them to a virtual house. This house consists of customizable rooms (and a customizable number of rooms). Each room's walls are immersive videos of concerts, sports games, live streams of famous plazas, or upload your own 3D movies. Users can experience any place that there is or ever has been a 3D camera, without the crowd and without the limitations of physicality (such as travel costs or conflicts).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also created a multiplayer system, so by inviting friends, with LEAP motion sensors the user can see and share live movements while experience content synchronously. The effect is a private virtual space within the virtual public space of the user's choosing. Not to mention, the house has no physical limitations, therefore creating possibilities for an infinite number of rooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although we all contributed with the creative decisions of TheatreV, there was a very efficient division of labor within the project. Bryce was knees-deep in Unity and Oculus hardware, Vish tackled the Kinect and aided with Unity, Bryan worked on the backend with Azure and the Synaptic Touchpad, and Ashley created the website and chilled out her teammates when they were panicking. These four pieces could be better meshed with more time, especially because a few technologies were abandoned to create a more effective product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into maaaaany challenges. There were technological incompatibilities between Unity and the Oculus, integration issues for multiplayer and the Kinect data, and Bryce broke the Microsoft team. That said, this idea can revolutionize the idea of privacy. Plus, we were ambitious and muscled through the various challenges, which is admirable. We each learned our specific technologies, as well as teammwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wish we had more time to pursue stitching various technologies together. The possibilities are endless with this unity of multiple players in public spaces without the limitations of physicality.
