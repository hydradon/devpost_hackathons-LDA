                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You're at a restaurant and you want to quickly split the bill. It's frustrating to have everyone pull out their cards and cash to pay, or even simply working out the amounts to pay. We aim to simplify that with a mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facture Fracture leverages the power of OCR using the Microsoft Computer Vision API to process an image of your bill, allow people to join in your bill, let people decide how to pay and additionally uses Interac to send payment requests
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app itself is built with react native. It communicates with our Flask backend built with python on a Microsoft Azure WebApp, which itself communicates with the Microsoft Computer Vision API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Handling communications between the app and the backend was hard as we had to understand how Http Requests are sent and received, and how to make sure the file sent by the app, in this case the image. was properly handled by the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also ran into issues developing the app being new to mobile app development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Being able to upload a picture from our phones to the cloud (Microsoft Azure)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Being able to analyze a picture of a bill
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Being able to communicate between our phones, the backend, and Microsoft services
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to first look at multiple tutorials to find a solution since the first answer isn't always applicable to our problem.
We also learned to seek help when stuck because although another person might not have the answer to our problem, they can provide us with insight on how to solve the issue
We also learned more about interacting with different services using requests
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Facture Fracture
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We truly believe that this app is useful to people as it came to us from our frustrating experiences eating out in groups. It also makes reimbursements much easier, as well as cashflow, since sending an interac request tells the participants exactly how much they need to be, and enables them to quickly repay the host!
