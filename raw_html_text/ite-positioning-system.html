                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GPS is a really cool invention but what if you could position yourself in a building using the dozens of WiFi access points positioned throughout the campus!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First it records access point signal strength data from various points throughout the building and stores them in an SQLite database within the Android app. When it's ready to determine a location, it again takes the signal strength of all nearby access points and compares it to the measurements of the points recorded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app consists of two pieces, the
                    <a href="https://github.com/RobRoseKnows/wifi-recorder" rel="nofollow">
                        Wifi Recorder
                    </a>
                    which records all the WiFi access points located by the device. It stores signal strength and a text value representing the location in an SQLite database. This was exported to a CSV file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built another application that would take the CSV file and calculate the averages and standard deviations of the tens of thousands of data points for each MAC Address.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second part is the
                    <a href="https://github.com/RobRoseKnows/indoor-gps" rel="nofollow">
                        Indoor GPS
                    </a>
                    which imports the data generated from the CSV and then looks at the points surrounding it to guess where the user is now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble using content providers and a few other elements of the Android API. Although all the logic works, we've consistently ran into minor bugs that prevented us from having a full locator prototype in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ITE Positioning System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to polish the technology so it works throughout all of ITE, rather than just a few select rooms. We also hope to in the future adopt more complex machine learning techniques to find a users location based on collected data. We also hope to simplify the two apps into a single app.
