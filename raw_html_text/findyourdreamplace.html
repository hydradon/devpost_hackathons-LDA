                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do you have the experience that you saw a splendid landscape/architectural photograph online but didn&rsquo;t know where the photo was shot? You tried to search for it but all that pops out were irrelevant information. It may be disappointing and desperate. With our website, this issue can be easily addressed. You can find the place in your dream with one click.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still Working on it

                <p>
                    You can find your dream place on the Google Map by just inputting URL of the picture in our searching box,  Then you can get the specific address with basic information about that place.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the backend, we used Google Cloud Vision APIs and these APIs return all relevant results of the picture the user input. We applied Heroku to deploy the server online.
For frontend, we got use of React JS and Google Maps APIs to search and display the location of the picture.
 We used cloud 9 of Amazon web service to share the code online. The advantage is that we just need to configure once and each computer can run the code without any problem. Also, like the google docs, we are able to code at the same time on the same program, which is very convenient and user-friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, We had never used google APIs before so we learned it by ourselves within 20 hours. 
Secondly, We applied Heroku to deployed the API server online. During this process, we met technical problems, such as we need to figure out how to use credential.
Moreover, at the beginning, we mixed frontend and backend in same repository, but node doesn&rsquo;t really support ES6, which makes React JS hard to compile. Therefore, we refactored the code and divided frontend and backend into two parts later.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that our website is fully completed. Although we were faced with so many obstacles, we succeeded in solving them. 
Through this process of development, we enjoy playing with Google Map APIs and Google Cloud Vision APIs, which could be powerful tools in future project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot during this project. We understand how to employ Google Map API and Google Cloud Vision API, which can be essential to our future career. We also learned to cooperate and work as the team. We learned helping each other and improving together.

                    What's next for FindYourDreamPlace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, we can add the feature that enables the user to upload the image except for URL. Secondly, we can add more information about the information in the picture except for its location.
