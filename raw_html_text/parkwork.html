                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    America is contains one of the highest amounts of people with obesity. In order to fix this problem, we wanted to implement fitness with something that will motivate a person : prizes. This combination of reward and physical activity will be done through Park Walk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Park Walk uses the built in camera to scan QR Codes. When a QR Code is scanned at designated fit-pits, a physical activity is displayed in groups of 10 (ex. 10 pushups, 10 sit ups). After doing 10 iterations of the given exercise, 10 points will be granted to your overall score. As your score increases, you can cash them in for prizes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Swift for iOS on Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with detecting QR codes and certain aspects of the apps such as using the Apple Maps API to assign locations to fit pits.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our app's ability to detect information from QR Codes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of iOS app development. We also became adept at basic UI design and aesthetic appeal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ParkWork
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to improve our app by implementing user accounts and customized music to play during a session at a Fitbit. 
We also want to add a leaderboard for friends to compete with each other and attempt to surpass one another.
