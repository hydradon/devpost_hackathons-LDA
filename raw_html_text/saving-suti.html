                    The concept for Animaltopia came from our team&rsquo;s desire to help educate and empower younger generations about our environmental responsibilities. Using the Amazon Sumerian framework, we explored a number of ideas around environmental awareness and conservation. In the end, we decided on the plight of sea turtles.

                    A vulnerable species adored by people of all ages, turtles are under increasing pressure from human activities, pushing them to extinction. Without more education and action, future generations may not be able to experience the beauty of these creatures and the natural world we often take for granted. So we set about designing several animal and environmental educational mini-games that users could go through to understand how their actions could bring about positive change.

                    Suti the sea turtle became our guiding light in the project to explore the world of sea turtles and environmental issues, as well as instill a spirit of fun into the game. Our team is a diverse group with people from various backgrounds, including some with children&mdash;but all of us felt the same passion for educating youth about the dangerous state of our environment due to the impact of humans on the planet and its wildlife.

                    Working together over the course of 7 weeks, our team of designers, artists, and developers built the Animaltopia MVP on the Amazon Sumerian platform to take advantage of the Sumerian hosts and technology features available on the platform. We chose webGL to ensure the widest audience possible, and moving forward we hope to refine and expand the world of Suti by leveraging the Sumerian platform to build further modules for other endangered species.
