                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired with the Myo armband and thought that a game would be a great use of its inputs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game takes input from the Myo armband and turns the in-game paddle to divert falling balls to their required places in order to gain points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game using Unity 5.2 and C#. We used the Myo sdk to connect the Myo armband to our Unity game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we faced was making the Myo armband control the game's paddle. We also faced many challenges in making the game itself with Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it work! We accomplished most of what we set out to do. We're proud of finishing it even though we knew nothing of the technologies we had to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Unity and how to use Myo from scratch. Two of our three members also had never used C# so they learned C# as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Myo Ball Slap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more platform support and multiple levels.
