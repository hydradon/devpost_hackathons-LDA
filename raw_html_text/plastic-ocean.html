                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Under the waters, there&rsquo;s a completely different atmosphere, ecosystem, and environment that we are polluting and we are unaware of it because we only see surface level. We&rsquo;re never able to take a look at the dramatic impact of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First scene, we're presented with a beautiful sunny day on the beach, sipping on beverages.
We casually (discretely guiltily) throw the bottles into the ocean thinking that it might not be so bad.
Second scene, we're immersed into the ocean with beautiful marine life and are able to view the implications of pollution.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C# and Unity/Steam VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of trouble implementing because it was our first time using anything related to VR including C# and Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of having a product and finishing, albeit not what we planned. However, we also didn't plan on doing a VR project. We're mostly proud of not giving up and persevering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A ton of new technology as well as a newfound confidence in ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Plastic Ocean
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely want to finish it to make it more of an emotion evoking experience.
