                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the countless tales of Florida Man: an intrepid thief who breaks into people's stores at night and robs them. Florida Man is a growing threat to retailers and personally causes millions of dollars in damage every year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used OpenCV and facial detection to differentiate between humans and inanimate objects. If a face is detected, an email will be sent to the storeowner alerting them of the robbery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We based our code upon current facial detection techniques.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found isolating a face on a certain part of the screen a challenge (our zoom function did not zoom directly zoom into the face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully manage to send an email everytime an intruder's face is detected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to read files from OpenCV, use call back functions, create classes in Python and call them, set up Git for verion control on our laptops, make basic operations occur on OpenCV.
                </p>

                    What's next for NewHacks_2019
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Try to get facial recognition working (create a database with specific criminals and track them.)
