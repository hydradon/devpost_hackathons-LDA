                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that could be used to reduce stress in a working environment. The idea behind our project is to allow pairs of employees to have a coffee break with each other so they could talk and let out their concerns and stress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CoffeeBreak make the user sign in after entering the employee id, selecting the department, start time and end time. It takes you to a page where it tries to match pairs of employee who used the website according to schedule selected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js on the backend, Bootstrap on the frontend and used MySql as the data base.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were only two people in our team. We had trouble with time interval. We needed to use absolute timing because we did not have to fix this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being only 2 and still being able to deliver on our project!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was Marieme's first Hackathon so it was a great learning experience for her, she work with Bootstrap for the first time! I learnt a lot about MySql as I have never worked with this database before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CoffeeBreak
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add a lot more features such as an anonymous messaging service and also work on the features that have already been built to make them more accurate!
