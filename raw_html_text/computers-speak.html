                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always been fascinated with the concept artificial intelligence and this is what drove me to make this program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in words and sentences along with there parts of speech and outputs different new sentences
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used txt files to store databases of words and sentence structures
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are modest programers so we ran into numerous problems such as writing in a txt file without writing over what was already there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tackling the vast complexities of the English language
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like I stated before we are not crazy experienced so we had to teach ourselves things like writing in a txt file without writing over what was already there and using the split() method.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Computers Speak
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is huge possibilities for this program like predicting what someone is trying to say based on the first few words and there parts of speech.
