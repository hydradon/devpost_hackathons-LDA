                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BlockSurvey came out as an idea from India DApp Fest Hackathon held on June 11th and 12th of 2019 under the theme Web 3.0 / Society 3.0. We built the prototype in the first 48 hours and post hackathon we built it further with more features for Can't Be Evil contest in the last two weeks time. We believe surveys/polls/feedback are sensitive in nature and many times it needs to be kept in private. Today, BlockSurvey.org does this by keeping the gained insights out of surveys/polls/feedback with the creator and not anyone else. And it also promotes takers to participate with confidence that their answers are not known to the creators. We strongly believe in protecting people's digital rights and wanted to share our part in building a better web for future.

                    What is does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BlockSurvey.org is a decentralized way to create surveys and polls. A completely anonymous and private way to create and collect surveys or polls or feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we have built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built using AngularJS for frontend and Blockstack(Blockstack authentication, Gaia for storage).
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Observed Angular JS kickoff was a little difficult.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Updates to data on existing Gaia storage files require to fetch and push every time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Working with the same Gaia storage file on different instances of browsers causes overriding. How to lock and ensure the file is not overridden.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is not an easy way to encrypt the data shared between two users.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    We are happy that we could pursue the hackathon idea to make it a publicly usable live version in two weeks of time.
