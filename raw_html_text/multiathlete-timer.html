                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always been annoyed at having to use multiple stopwatches to record my teammates' mile or lap splits at races.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is a chronograph that allows one to record splits for multiple runners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Android SDK with Android Studio to produce the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with a GUI API with which I was not familiar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a simple but very overlooked idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Android XML scheme, the Android Java API, and GUI development skills.
                </p>

                    What's next for Multiathlete Timer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allowing coaches to addtionally set specific points in advance, labeled with distances, at which they will take athletes' splits and use said splits to determine athletes' paces throughout the race.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Storage of athlete names for reuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scoring Features: allow coaches to record when each of their athletes or an athlete of a named, opposing team crosses the finish line, and use the order of athletes' finishes to determine the score for each team according to a specific scoring scheme. For example, one popular scoring scheme for Track races is 10 points, 8 points, 6 points, 4 points, 2 points, and 1 point for first through sixth place, in that order.
