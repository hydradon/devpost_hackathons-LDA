                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for our app stemmed from several posts on social media that spread awareness about homeless people's struggles, yet how these people still maintained a positive outlook. Spreading awareness isn't enough, we realized. We then decided to build our app focusing on helping homeless people rebuild their life.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app has two main features: Explore Help and Share Your Story. The 'Explore Help' feature prompts users to enter their location and job interests that they may have. Based on this information, our app outputs a personalized plan for these people, including shelters nearby and startup jobs they may apply for, as well as links to these jobs. The 'Share Your Story' feature allows people who meet and are inspired by homeless people to share the location of a homeless person (after permission, of course) and share their story; people who are moved by their story can stop by their location and donate money to help that person thrive.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app with HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, all relatively new languages to our team!

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into included debugging (several!) errors and brainstorming ways on how to structure our application.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of how much we learned from this hackathon while also having a great time! I'm so happy that we were able to create an app that has a great impact on this world, in just 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many new things about HTML and CSS, including how to inject HTML into JavaScript, which was super cool! We learned how to navigate the console and developer tools for JavaScript, which was really helpful.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan on expanding our app to target states and countries outside of just California. We'd also like to add to our 'Share Your Story' feature so that likes and shares can be implemented as well.
