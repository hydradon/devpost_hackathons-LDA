                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally thought of creating a game that would prompt the player different questions, starting with which curriculum they might be interested in. Over the duration of the game, questions would start to be tailored to what the player seemed most interested in. The name Eduvolve comes from Education + Evolve. We want to evolve education literally - by providing the next generation various options of what they want to do, we're educating them while also evolving the chatbot using natural language processing technologies.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A chatbot that can be added to Facebook Messenger or Slack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Dialogflow, we developed and deployed a chatbot that recognized basic commands like "Hi" or "Hello". We trained the bot to recognize commands like "make me a curriculum" or "curriculum please" and it was able to recognize certain commands even though it wasn't exact verbatim. In the Slack channel, a user could type in "Hi" and the Eduvolve bot would respond to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many. We initially had trouble coming up with a way to implement a game and determined that it wasn't feasible to make such game within 24 hours. As a result we chose to make something along the lines of a text-based game, and looked into chatbots. Twilio had very neat tutorials and proper documentation on how to create a functional chatbot for SMS and Facebook Messenger. We were able to utilize Autopilot to deploy a functional bot on our Facebook page but quickly realized the limitations of Autopilot. That's when we decided to make the switch to Dialogflow, with which we were able to deploy another functional bot on our Facebook page. Training the bot to recognize certain commands and follow specific conditionals was another challenge. In the end, we were unable to create the fleshed-out bot we wanted with many commands that led to specific commands, again due to the limitations of the platform.

                    What's next for Eduvolve
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eduvolve has great potential in the right hands. It's definitely possible to create a game that can truly inspire the next generation that isn't just limited to texting.
