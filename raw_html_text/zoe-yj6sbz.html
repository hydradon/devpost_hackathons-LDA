                    and recipes, depending on consumer needs and health indicators. The consumer has the ability to use the Zoe standalone via Facebook messenger but can combine the VidaMe app for tracking health and general wellbeing related parameters, via structured questionnaires based on goal setting theory, regarding nutrition, physical activity, vital signs and other health indicators. Our target is to combine Zoe with VidaMe app, as a digital assistant and guide to use the app and as a nutrition/health advisor.

                    bot developed using Java 8 as the native code language. The intents and slots created by using Amazon Lex tools and built an Amazon Lambda function in order to create the business logic of the bot. Slots values validated in lambda function, and send the response to Lex platform. The data retrieved from an Amazon Dynamo DB database using userID as a unique key to identify the user each time he/she communicates with the bot.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VIDAVO&rsquo;S IT team have experience in development of mhealth apps, platforms, api&rsquo;s and services. Building a nutrition bot combining new technologies and health knowledge it's very challenging it. It was our first approach to build a bot and we didn&rsquo;t use before the Amazon Lex and Lambda, so our main challenge was to learn very quickly to manage all the components.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time we developed a chatbot. Winning or not, this was for us a good opportunity to investigate new technologies and tools to a new field in real time. The combination of data complexity and the sensitivity of health related data processed of a digital assistant in the healthcare sector is a big challenge. We are very proud, that we did our first step and ancompishment this challenge using AWS services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting familiar with Amazon services and tools such as Lex, Lambda and DynamoDB, we believe that is the most beneficial thing we learned during this challenge. We gain knowledge in a field that we are very interested in, the chatbots industry. Getting familiar with future tools that we can use to change the way our customers interact with our apps is very important to us.

Also, we want to combine knowledge, connected to 3rd party API&rsquo;s ex healthvault, food product database, Databases ex  CDC, WHO, NHS, and NIH databases in order to provide more accurate data and motivate the consumers to live healthier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will proceed the development of Zoe bot in order to provide:
