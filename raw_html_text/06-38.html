                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to see the statistics for how long we spent researching and studying vs other time on the internet, but nothing like this existed before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeps track of how long you have been on each domain, accurate to every 3 seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked into the basic chrome extension outline, and added a background page and a popup page. We also added an options page, and added javascript elements to each of the pages, to make it have functional elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally didn't know how to code javascript, so we had to learn how to do it. Chrome also has specific requirements for its extensions, and has difficult to access apis, and took us a long time to find everything we needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to learn how to javascript within html, and we made a graphic that is clean and visually appealing. we also made a layout that allows for easy future modifications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with javascript in conjunction with html and css in a chrome extension.
We also learned how to make an extension with chrome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 06:38
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to add a feature that adds a time limit maximum for a certain domain, and after you pass the limit, it blocks the website for the day.
