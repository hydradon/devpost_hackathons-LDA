                    We use image recognition to allow users to upload new places to keep our database up-to-date and full of interesting places.  Users can take pictuers of places not already on the map, and we'll record the location and also determine what kind of place it is, whether it's a restroom, practice room, vending machine, or something else! Adding new placese is as easy as taking a picture and clicking submit: we take care of the rest so you can Fynd it fast!
