                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like to play Tonk with each other when we're bored. The problem is, we never have cards on us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a text-based version of Tonk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java to code this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't notice spare curly brackets, and had trouble working around having a break in the actual game. At first, we didn't have a complete understanding of interactions with the command line in the terminal, but we were able to get it to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn more about our capabilities and, to put it simply, the fact that we were able to code a game in the first place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about our capabilities and coding in an environment where we are all focused on getting work done is pretty productive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tonk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We haven't implemented melds, which are combos in Tonk of 3 cards of the same suit in the row or more, or 3 cards with the same number or symbol but with different suits. They were extremely difficult, and we hope with a deeper understanding of Java we are able to implement this in possible future versions.
