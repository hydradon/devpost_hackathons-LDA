                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional means of shipping can be expensive, inefficient, and stressful. For example, one of the struggles we have to deal with is constantly worrying about the size and weight of our packages. In fact, as our society advances, this issue becomes even more prominent, which is why we developed this idea of a more effective means of package delivery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app connects people who want to send packages with drivers already en route to package destination. This way, drivers do not have to deviate much from their original destination, creating a more effective means of transportation. A user sends a request, and a driver picks up the package. The driver can then proceed in his or her original direction and simply drop off the package at its destination, with the benefit of earning additional income.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front End - We started with a basic home screen and we added additional features and pages, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with the help of the Bootstrap library. Using animations along with an idea for a simplistic design, we ended up with a very elegant and sophisticated web app.
Back End - We used the HERE API to generate a map with starting and ending locations. We used Pubnub services to communicate with other devices to send map locations, costs of the delivery, and ETAs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges that we encountered in the development process was the integration of the front end with the back end. More specifically, due to our limited experience and knowledge, we had trouble with combining JavaScript features with the HTML and CSS files; however, through much research and help from the organizers, we were able to complete this task. Furthermore, this was our first time working with API's, so there was a learning curve for that area as well.
                </p>
