                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From friends who are UBER drivers, we realized that it is often difficult for these people to find places with a lot of business. Most of these apps do not provide any type of this kind, so we wanted to make an app that could help these drivers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app finds public events ranging from parties to sporting events from websites such as EventBrite and Facebook that will have people who probably need rides. These events are sorted by location, date, and time, meaning drivers can look in the future and plan ahead. All of it is then displayed as a heat map with an adjustable radius so that drivers can easily visualize the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the app for iOS and coded in Objective C and Swift.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                    Parsing data and Facebook.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working app, and this is the first time most of our team has worked in iOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything!
                </p>

                    What's next for Rebu
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make the app two-fold; we would like to have a version that is targeted toward the average person looking for something to do. They could use our app to find local events that they might be interested in based on how popular the event is in real time. We hope that by having both a version that helps people find events and another version that helps drivers find people who needs rides, we can help drivers get more business while also help people have a good time.
