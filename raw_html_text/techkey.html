                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by the frustration that young people have when helping their parents and grandparents with simple technology. We found that there isn't one place to consistently get help with household technology, and a part of the trouble is finding that information effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application would work on computers and mobile devices to provide an image centric hub for technology help. This way, people who do not know a lot about technology can find the help they're looking for quickly and easily.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After some struggle with ReactJS, we decided to submit Wireframe models made on Figma to communicate our idea. There is also a mockup of the homepage made with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our technical inexperience with building webapps hindered our ability to make a real, functioning mockup.
