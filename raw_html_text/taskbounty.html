                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many City of Houston 311 service requests are either not a priority or not within the purview of the City to address. We need a service that allows citizens to crowdfund and outsource service requests to private contractors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Acts as a service marketplace where citizens can submit tasks that have not been addressed in a timely manner by Houston 311 with bounties attached. Other private citizens or contractors who would like to claim the bounties by fixing the issues could do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A page and API hosted on ServiceNow using AngularJS for front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had limited experience with local city policies and ordinances but we were able to consult with a subject matter expert and city employee to expand our knowledge base.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a platform for empowering and employed local citizens to address local municipal concerns, ultimately positioning ourselves to be a force multiplier for the City of Houston's 311 system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the strengths and weaknesses of the City's 311 system and how to address its gaps through a fee-for-service marketplace. We also learned some of the nuances of city policy and ordinances pertinent to addressing municipal concerns.
                </p>
