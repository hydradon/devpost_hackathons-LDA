                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though I've never played it myself, Rogue has inspired many of the modern games I enjoy, such as The Binding of Isaac and Dead Cells. Rogue is a deceptively complicated game and I felt that trying to hack together a clone would be a good learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game randomly generates several rooms, and connects those rooms with paths. It is turn based, and the player can control their character by inputting text commands into the console, such as typing 'w' to move up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this game using Visual Studio and c++ on Windows.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tried to surround the floor tiles with wall tiles, rather than just have the boundaries be empty space. Unfortunately, I over complicated this and ended up scrapping the wall idea because it was taking too much time to implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the rooms in such a way that all of the rooms are accessible. This was surprisingly difficult, and the result isn't always pretty, but at least the player can access any and all of the rooms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned one method of randomly generating video game levels, how to connect randomly placed rooms, how to move enemies in a random way, how to move a player character using keyboard input, and I increased my proficiency with using arrays by utilizing multi-dimensional arrays and partial arrays.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Reprobate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, I will try to make the combat more interesting and robust, hide the contents of rooms that haven't been entered yet, add the capability to create multiple levels of increasing difficulty, and add a final boss and main objective.
