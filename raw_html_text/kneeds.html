                    This project targets Laborers, Employers and Governments that pay the price for workplace injuries, due in part to poorly designed work-wear that prioritizes and perpetuates the perceived stereotypical needs of the &ldquo;tough guy&rdquo; in developing safety gear.

                    Back disorders can develop gradually as a result of repetitive activity. Their slow and progressive onset is often ignored resulting in debilitating injury.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back injuries cost an incalculable amount of human suffering. In the US alone, back disorders afflict over 600,000 employees annually costing about $50 billion in lost productivity, and economic burden on compensation systems. (NIOSH) via. (

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was primarily inspired by experiencing stress and strain, over the knees with conventional, bulky, denim work-wear. As well as emerging trends in activewear for all sexes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've all heard the common refrain, "Bend at your knees, not at your back"
                </p>
                <p>
                    KNEEDS Is the knee portion of a garment, giving the wearer a positive and recognizable visual cue when lifting heavy objects the correct way. The unique knitting structure indicates when the knees are being engaged, and when the user is utilizing the correct posture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Desired advancements include: integrated durable knit structures and padded knit structures that protect the user. As well as assistive structures that encourage the user to return to a normal yet muscularly engaged posture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it was built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prototype was built on the STOLL Knitting Machine, utilizing plating, on a circular ribbed knit structure to achieve the desired effect: color change when a persons knees are engaged in bending.

                    Challenges

                <p>
                    Developing the appropriate knitting structures to achieve the desired effects.
Achieving buy-in for a product or concept that represents an evolution of work-wear beyond what is currently available and fits into commonly held perceptions of safety and masculinity.

                <p>
                    Iterated Samples of the desired product to create a working prototype that changes color in the targeted area within the users field of view when lifting.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Breakthroughs are not always represent by a significant technological innovation. Significant breakthroughs can result from seeing things through a different lens. A innovative breakthrough can be achieved by the wide scale adoption of a concept that is highly accessible and represents an evolution of existing trends.

                <h2>
                    What's next for KNEEDS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better work-wear for working better. Kneeds represents the evolution of work-wear and the image of masculinity. Utilizing shapewear knitting technology and following trends in Active-wear to create corrective and assistive garments that support and encourage workers to perform work the right way without the burden of bulky restrictive clothing.
