                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an individual who has a passion for learning different languages and understanding the essence of establishing neurological pathways in learning a language, have decided to create a program that will allow for direct links in the language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program will ask the individual to select a setting. Then based on the setting that the user is in (i.e classroom) then the program will display a word of an object in a foreign language (Target language that the user is trying to learn), then a sound file will play with the pronunciation of the word will play. The user will then be asked to actively seek the object and take a photo of it. If the photo matches then the program will proceed to another word.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using two google-cloud APIs.  The first was the google-cloud-vision API that was used to label the objects within a picture and see if it corresponds with the word (object) that was displayed prior. Then the second API that was used is the google-cloud-text-to-speech  that will take the word in the foreign language and output the sound file with the pronunciation.
                </p>
