                    Inspiration: Some of us have held jobs at restaurants or grocery stores and we noticed that these establishments tend to waste a lot of food/products when it gets close to the expiration date etc. As a way to decrease the amount of wasted food everyday, we felt that there should be a bridge between stores donating the products they don't want or need and people who lack basic everyday accessories.

                    What it does: Our project is a social website where companies, restaurants, and individuals can post the location, time, date, and instructions towards any charitable events that they're hosting or are part of. Once the form is submitted, it is sent into a database, which is ordered as recent posts first, and that data is then extracted and put into a public calendar and map. There is a rating system which increases for each time a party hosts an event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it: We built this website using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into: After the first few hours of the event, one of our group members fell ill and needed rest. Our first issue was integrating an SQL database into our website. This turned out to be a very time consuming challenge, along with the issue of us not being able to put our webpage on a server. We then ran into problems with the calendar as it wouldn&rsquo;t update when the forms were submitted.

                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Building on an idea which is capable of significantly improving people&rsquo;s daily lives. Most of us were learning along the way and despite the setbacks, we are very satisfied with the finished product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned: We learned more about the community we live in. There are many unforeseen challenges when implementing something completely new.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for CharityParity- Table 11F: We hope to get into contact with stores in the area and see what they think of our idea, and if they would be a part of it, if completed. If not we will ask for feedback to see what it would take for stores/restaurants to use the website or if its even a feasible idea in their eyes. Ideally we would like to continue to work on this project to promote a sense of community in this area, and give people the opportunity to get food when they cant afford it.
