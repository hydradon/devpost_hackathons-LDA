                <p>
                    Our idea is to create a pad that the delivery person can put their package on. Face recognition will authorize only valid users to pick up package. If un-authorized person picks up package, then an alert is sent to phone of home owner with a picture of package being stolen. Furthermore, when the camera does not recognize the person, the device starts beeping to scare away the would-be thief. 
The face detection would work using Google AutoML Vision. We tested if it could recognize our face, which it did properly. We would connect that to our device using arduino or rpi.
For now, we can only demonstrate the weight portion and the face recognition portion properly, but not connected directly.
