                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Providing a feature to StreetView that doesn't exist that is considerably useful.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project provides a video service to Google StreetView. Sometimes the best way to truly understand a trip is to see it for yourself. Google StreetView provides a good method for viewing individual spots on a journey but has no system that allows you to play the whole trip. VR compatible, this application attempts to make the experience of traveling by car as realistic as possible. Short of the vibrations of the road, bugs on the windshield and strange smells; you'll feel like your really there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used google's Geolocation API to get each polyline from one Origin to its Destination. Then the StreetView image API to retrieve high detail images of each street line on the way to its destination. This was then presented through a C# frontend GUI and a python backend running the service to convert the images into a video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Polyline decoding is very complicated
Image to Video transition is very finnicky
                </p>
