                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for GooseGooseSearch was to prioritize user privacy by keeping data securely from search engines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our searches cite Google, yahoo, and other big name search engines for you, passing no information about you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Terra and GTK+
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to implement as many features as we wanted to in a rather short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OS X Yosemite support!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was tedius for Brian personally, since he did not have much experience using Terra, but we both learned valuable commands that will end up helping us in the future.
