                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a cheap and easy way to sort waste within a wastebin, including differentiating between landfill and recycled items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system is able to determine which bin, landfill or recycling, that a piece of waste should be directed towards using Google AutoML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The majority of the project is of a hardware nature; from the chute direction mechanism to the motor driver arduino and it&rsquo;s Dragonboard controller. The system is able to interface with AutoML though an API call via the Dragonboard.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mechanism planning and design was a challenge for us, as most of our experience resides in electronics and software development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to complete a full hardware mock-up of our project, with minimal power tools needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our teammates had never touched an arduino mega before this event, and became experts in using them!
