                <p>
                    The team was very excited for this competition, as none of them had previously
participated in any Hackathon competition.  The entire week leading up to the
event consisted of hopeful talk and growing excitement for what lay ahead.
Mason and Alex had no prior experience building responsive web apps, so Michael
gave the team a serious
                    <strong>
                        crash course
                    </strong>
                    into HTML, CSS Bootstrap, Javascript,
and MongoDB.

                <h2>
                    What is SurveyMaster?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SurveyMaster is a survey hosting/analytics tool that is perfect for live
presentations, long term survey analysis, or even a great survey tool to use
with your favorite app: reddit. SurveyMaster lets you become the master of
surveys, giving you the power to create a survey, host that survey, and actively
watch participant data and analytics flow in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does SurveyMaster differ from other survey tools?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SurveyMaster is unique in that it has a sleek, easy-to-use design that works
very well for users with little to no technical prowess, while also still
providing relevant, good-looking data to more advanced users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Where to go from here?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The brilliant thing about SurveyMaster is that it is coded well, such that
expansion in virtually any direction is possible.  Though we had charts and
graphs implemented, they were not able to make the final cut. With more
time and a revisiting of fetching results data from MongoDB and feeding that
into the charts, it would be possible to implement many different forms
of sleek statistical data and provide more ways for users to analyze their
surveys.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other feature up on next on the drawing board is using AJAX to live-update
the analytics/results page to show data flow in real time.  While we were close
on this mark too, we had to ultimately scrap it, leaving behind a skeleton of
what it would have been.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is exciting imagining the different directions this site will be able to take
without a 36-hour encapsulation around it.  The team would be able to sleep and
really focus 100% on the code without drifting off or having the mind wander off.
