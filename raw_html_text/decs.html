                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A simple way to orient yourself in the street without the need to take out your phone, so it is more safe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is like a compass, but instead of pointong north, it points where you want to go in a simple and elegant way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Fitbit API (using svg, javascript and css), using a mobile app with google maps API to set the location where i want to go, and a server built using PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Fitbit API is very limited, the langagues are stripped of a lot of functions. Compatibility, google maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The compass is fairily reliable. The android and iphone apps. The authentication.
                </p>
                <h2>
