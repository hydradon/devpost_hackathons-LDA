                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make this budgeting application for college students who tend to buy excessive amounts of snacks despite a tight budget. This is an application that encourages smart finance and smart health via open data, which are hallmarks of a smart nation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a category for the product (e.g on promotion/on shopping list/over budget) to influence our choice and encourage us to buy items from our shopping list to prevent excessive spending on unnecessary snacks. When picking up an item, the tool automatically checks off the item from the shopping list while displaying an accumulative list and cost of goods in the shopping cart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envisioned how the experience will play out in the mart and devised a work flow based on features identified in a flow chart of a customer's experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    We will be using
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the simulation using Unity engine with AR simulator Vuphoria, which was used to create filters representing different categories. We uploaded the application onto an android mobile device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity and VR technology is new to our team, but we were more familiar with them after the workshops. We were hesitant if the camera would be able to detect the products as many products we wanted to detect had curved surfaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a working prototype to showcase at the presentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the ideation process, we had many ideas on how to use augmented reality technology to improve our lives and we decided to create an application which connects with our daily struggles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Value$
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can apply this technology to other spheres of education that would benefit from a repository of knowledge when an object is displayed. An example would be AR glasses for a tour around botanic gardens to identify the plants.
