                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were having a conversation about the word femininity and thought it was funny to add -ininity to other words and thought that other people may find enjoyment out of it as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Put a word into the prompt and it returns the -ininitized version of the word. Example: hack becomes hackininitized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we used
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift on xcode to build the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither the team or I really knew how to program on Swift, or really knew how to use Xcode, and we were not very familiar with the Mac OS. Understanding the syntax and tools provided by the IDE and language was challenging to learn and put into action but it was a good experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my entire team's first hackathon, and how we were able to make a simple app using an environment we knew nothing about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the basic syntax and basic usage of Swift and Xcode. During the 30 hours I spent at this hackathon I was able to become more acquainted with Swift, the Mac OS, Xcode, and Javascript(in some of my free time)
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don't have any plans for the future of our app at the moment.
