                            Ever wondered what the fastest song of the Beatles is? Or tried to find all Porcupine Tree songs with guitar solos greater than 3 minutes? Or the Radiohead song with the most number of happy words (if that's even possible)? Being a music junkie, i often find myself looking for these in a wide variety of places.

                            I could not find a project (research or otherwise) which has tried to analyze the lyrics of Indian film songs using common data analysis techniques.

                            Pulls all metadata and audio features of all songs of an artist from Spotify using their APIs. Looks up the lyrics on Musixmatch and puts all of this into a single object which is then indexed. This can then be searched, aggregated and plotted to our hearts content.

                            Crawled ~1800 Hindi songs (metadata + lyrics) from

                            and analyzed them similarly. Because most data analysis tools/algorithms are primarily geared towards english data, I added a translation layer using the Google Translation APIs.

                        <p>
                            Search using a restricted natural query language
Eg: 1. "Bon Iver songs about loneliness" 2. "fastest Beatles song in the key of E" 3. "Hindi songs after 1980 about cars"
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Use NLTK for semantic searching
Eg: "Beatles songs about love" should return hits for lyrics containing "affection"
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Plot all of the analyzed data in a neat dashboard. This dashboard can then be furthered queried and filtered by simple clicks.
Eg: If i want to find all Bon Iver songs with the time signature 3/8, i just click on 3 in the "Time Signature" panel and every other panel (lyrics, songs etc.) are filtered for this query. (Image 1)

                        Built an extensible platform that interested people can use to extract data. Elasticsearch has easily accessible APIs to get all of the indexed data. For example, an anthropology student studying Indian political outreach via films can extract data from my system easily.
