                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since none of us actually owned a dog we thought it would be interesting to create a dating site from their point of view. We thought that a dog dating site would be original and funny, yet be achievable as an idea within 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays a homepage with twelve dog profiles including pictures and basic information. We have buttons at the top that take you to a submission form for users to input data about their own dog. As of now the back end stuff has had some minor errors in testing so we were not able to implement it into our website. Another button takes us to the about us page where we wrote about the project and the authors. And then home button takes you home!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the front end stuff was built using html and css.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back end javascript and databases were really difficult to implement into our project.

                <p>
                    We had a great time making our
                    <strong>
                        FIRST

                <p>
                    We're going to implement true functionality of our product. We will have all the buttons working and hopefully more features. A complete system allowing for user input and filtering of dog profiles.
