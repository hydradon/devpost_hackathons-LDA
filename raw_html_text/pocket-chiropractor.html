                    Inspiration I always look down at my phone, this destroys posture as your neck and back get used to this position I started to think if my phone could tell me I am looking down I could fix my posture all the time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does The app has the user set a minimum position for their phone then notifies them when the phone is lower than that position.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we accessed the accelerometer of the phone for the position, used a button to select the target minimum position and if the phone went below that the notification will go off so the user can correct their posture
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of issues with the UI it is really difficult with Android studio and we had to look up a lot of hints and tutorials. For a long time, we were unsure if the accelerometer would be the best choice as it isn't super accurate and has issues when the phone is tilted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    we could not add other pages or fragments
we could not limit the notification time or delay them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product works even outside of the app 
It's issue to use and was easy to make
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we understand so much about Android studio and we were forced to put a lot of what we already knew to the test.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pocket--Chiropractor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the notifications spam the user quite a bit we would like to make it possible to delay them
more features or a tutorial of some time for ease of use
a way to turn off notifications while the app runs
saving the minimum position
Talk to a chiropractor on how to improve the app
