                    The leading causes for mental illness for Canadian university students are the stress from heavy workload, loneliness from lack of community support, and isolation of campus space from the wider community. Therefore, we are addressing these issues by creating the Future University Health Network (FUHN) website media for connection between the students and community to provide more support and resources for students, in order to increase awareness for mental health while helping students in need. The FUHN network will work to collaborate with mental health organizations, campus groups and student organizations to raise funding and promote peer and community support.
