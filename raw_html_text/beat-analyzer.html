                <p>
                    Beatmaps are very tedious to put together. To ensure quality, human input for detailed beatmap generation is required (which can take many iteration and it is a slow/repetitive process) Traditional algorithm generated beatmap can be skewed by factors such as volume/amplitude peaks, noise (in the wave forms). We want to implement a better, more accurate and automatic beatmap generator

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Visualize based on music file and side-by-side beats to match with the music pattern comparson.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity3D engine for visualization and front end. Osu! beatmap data for truth/training data. 
Google Tensorflow machine learning library for training and learning.

                <p>
                    First time using Tensorflow library for machine learhning, extraction of data original song forms and beats from Osu!'s beatmaps.
