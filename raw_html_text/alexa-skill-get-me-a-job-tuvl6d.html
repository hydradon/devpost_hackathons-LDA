                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last year I had an informal conversation with one of my seniors who used various job portals to look for suitable jobs. He missed lot of opportunities because he didn&rsquo;t get time to check the portals every day. Also I realized that, Students now view online job posting data as a practical source to explore the nature of today&rsquo;s dynamic labor market. The real-time nature of job data allows the early detection of labor demand trends, which gives students a forward-looking analytical tool.
                    <br>
                    So, I am coming up with a project goal to find a way which helps as a search light for the students. The proposed project will make significant contributions, both to fresh graduates but also individuals who are willing to change their career path.

                    With the advent of numerous technologies from last decade, it is very difficult to find the potential technology which has longevity. So, students surround themselves with lot of ambiguity about the choice of their field. None of the current tool to find out the latest technologies for students to get ready for job opportunities with real time data. In future, I will analyze responsibilities in job descriptions and answer below questions.
Some of the user questions which will be answered
I.  What are the current demanding skills most employers looking for any job like software Developer?
                    <br>
                    II. What are the job responsibilities most commonly outlined in job descriptions?
III.    If different cities have different skills, they like to emphasize for any job?
What differences if any, exist between the responsibilities and job functions of entry level and non-entry level job positions?
