                    Inspiration - Our inspiration was the current hurricane in the Carolina
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - Currently it is a unity game to that is learning to avoid obstacles with machine learning so that during rescue it will not run into debris.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - We built it with long hours on and hard work.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into - Everything at first one part from the car kit was broken so we had to find a replacement that did not work quite as well. The learning part of the machine learning does not work very well ether.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of - It runs sort of.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned - 36 hours is a very short time to try and accomplish a lot of our goals
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Archimedes - Try and get the machine learning working in our free time.
