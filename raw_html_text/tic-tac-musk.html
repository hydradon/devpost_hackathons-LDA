                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Talk about Elon in the text box, if you're nice he may let you win the game. If not, he will be impossible to beat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Went through a minimax algorithm tutorial on Youtube to learn how to build the unbeatable tic tac toe game and then used sentiment analysis from the node package manager to determine if the user is saying something positive or negative about Elon.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the sentiment analysis into the minimax script.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned more about node.js and got to get my feet wet with the Naive Bayes classifer, elementary level machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tic Tac Musk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though it's impossible, I think Elon could beat the minimax algorithm. I would like to see Elon play himself in Tic Tac Musk.
