                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to create a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It runs on both desktop and Android, and controls well on both.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Runbrella with Java. To collaborate, we used Github and Gradle. The framework we used was Libgdx, a multi platform engine for games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into troubles because of differing visions of the completed games. One example is that Ryan wanted short handmade levels, but the rest didn't want the work of creating them. Another is that Brian W wanted a dash movement, but Ryan believed that it didn't fit in with the controls that already existed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of the maneuverability of our character.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how Gradle is used more in depth, without having an IDE handle everything. We also learned how to collaborate although having different workflows.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Runbrella
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To continue working on Runbrella, we could change the end goal of the game, create levels instead of generating them, and/or generate levels with more sophistication
