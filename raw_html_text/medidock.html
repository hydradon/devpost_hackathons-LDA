                    Are you like the millions of Americans that are on several different medications, but somehow you always seem to forget to take medication? MediDock is an all-in-one medication management system that allows you to track and remember to take your medication through a convenient iOS app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing Swift and Xcode, we developed and designed an iOS app that is easy to use and full of important information about the medication people take on a daily basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we were going to build a scale system that allows you to automatically track your dosage by just taking the medication as you normally do and a partnering app that keeps track of it automatically using a scale system. Unfortunately, the hardware necessary for this was not at our disposal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed and designed a beautiful application full of useful features.
                </p>

                    What's next for MediDock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to continue to add features and make it truly the only medication management app you'll need.
