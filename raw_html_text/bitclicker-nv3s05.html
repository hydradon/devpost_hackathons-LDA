                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are completely new to app development, in fact this is the first app either of us have made. We came in with only basic knowledge of java, and studied and worked hard to try our best to create a first app that we could be proud of. It seemed like it would not be too difficult at first, but we ended up working very hard on this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Similar to the viral game "Cookie Clicker," the user clicks on a BitCamp logo to generate "bit" currency. This currency can then be used in the shop to buy a handful of exciting upgrades, to further help you get more currency at an even faster rate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We downloaded Android Studio and Used Photoshop to program and design our application. We used a significant amount of googling and YouTube videos to learn the basics as we built the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we are not extremely well experienced, we spent a lot of time on building simple methods and features on the app. We spent many hours trying to work out a way for the user to buy automation upgrades, so that they would not need to click on the button for all of the currency. Unfortunately after hours of work, we could not quite figure out the solution, and we had to scratch that idea, but this left us short on time to complete the rest of the application. This made us feel as though the app felt a bit incomplete, lacking a handful of features we would have really enjoyed, such as animation and an end goal to the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a pretty stable and aesthetically pleasing app for two creators with no prior experience in android and mobile application programming. The app is an amazing first app that we have created, and we both now have a nice base of knowledge on android programming to further build on and create new apps in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some features that may seem simple on a program or application actually require significantly more work and knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BitClicker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to figure out the automation, and then further make the app feel more complete and polished. After that we want to get the app on the play store to share with further people around the world, and to show to people coming into BitCamp in the future with a little knowledge on programming, as a bit of inspiration to show what you can learn in just this weekend.
