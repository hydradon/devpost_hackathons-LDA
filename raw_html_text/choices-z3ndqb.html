                    It was the best out of the 4 assigned.  Tired of putting 1s or 2s in chat.

                    What it does

                    Real time polling on good, evil, or neutral for the streamer and their community/chat.

                    Drew it out first on paper
Configuration service
Added bits cause you always gotta be baking that bread to obtain it / getting that quan
Kept it somewhat simple because I don't like extra work as a viewer but I still want to participate but not really but I do and I can't be bothered with more work but I still want to give my opinion so don't shame me about it

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of setting up.  Too many variables getting developer rig going and terminal time.
I had a lot of time on google because I don't work in the dev world anymore (git commands, python commands, etc.)

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's somewhat workable.  A few bugs but that's what makes it fun.
It was good getting back into it (dev that is) and getting feedback from my friends at Twitchcon who happen to be streamers and being able to tell them the story.

                    It's a lot of work to get this going.

                    Maybe it'll be finished later on or not, probably will.
