                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wanted to see how your brain reacts to music? With this web application, you can see your brainwaves through a colorful UI that shows if you're calm or agitated and you  can choose what type of music you want to change those brainwaves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project utilizes a Dragonboard 410c, Amazon web services (and SQS, Amazon's Simple Queuing Service), and a Muse headband to let the user see their brainwaves in a colorful transition. When the user wears the Muse headband, their brainwave data is sent as OSC (Open Sound Control) packets which contain EEG (Electroencephalography) values. The values are floats that range from 7 to 60; 7 being the calmest state of mind and 60 being its highest agitation or excitement. The Muse headband is connected through Bluetooth to the Dragonboard and sends the brainwave data to the board, too. The Dragonboard will process the data to put it in the form of an array with rounded down integer values. This array will be sent as a message to the SQS queuing system that Amazon provides. The data will be stored in that queue and the AWS we page will pull that data from the SQS. The web page will be the UI and have three buttons with a real-time "interactive" background. There will be a button for playing calming songs and a button for playing active songs. The third button pauses all music playing. The background will change colors on a spectrum depending on the inputted brainwave values. Colors closer to blue will indicate that the user is calmer. Colors closer to pink will indicate that the user is more active and/or agitated. The colors in between will form a gradient that corresponds to the values in between 7 and 60. The user will be able to physically see their brainwaves calming down or getting more agitated.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *The open source code or any official/released software for extracting data from the Muse.io program was not compatible with the Muse 2016
*Apps that can use Muse were $9-$15
*SDK's for the Muse were not compatible with the Muse 2016
*Muse.io was not compatible with the Linux OS on the Dragonboard 410c.
*Dragonboard 410c did not come with a monitor, connection cables, keyboard or mouse
*Dragonboard 410c could was not visible by the VM
*Amazon Website Services credit received for educational purposes does not support SQS

                    *Finding hardware to work with the Muse and wait until MuseLab, Muse.io, Museplayer are compatible with the Muse 2016
*Have the songs be ranked from calm to hyped with a value indicating how much of each they are on a spectrum. 
*Play more active songs when trying to become agitated and decrease the rank of how active that song is depending on the brainwaves being currently read. Vice versa for a calming state.
