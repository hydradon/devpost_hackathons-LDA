                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration that we had to create this website was the need to provide businesses a way to receive payments form their clients and pay their employees through "ATH-M&oacute;vil" in an easy, low-cost and seamless way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bizpay is a website that allows businesses to receive payments from its clients and pay all its employees through a website console.  It is specifically built to help make these processes easier and more organized using "ATH-M&oacute;vil&rsquo;s" platform and API&rsquo;s. It is basically a concept of what we think &ldquo;ATH-M&oacute;vil business&rdquo; should look like in its web client and the features it should include.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by first, designing the website based on a dashboard interface. Then, we integrated programing languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the apps interface. After that, we made a database of information and integrated &ldquo;ATH M&oacute;vil&rsquo;s&rdquo; API to make it all work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges were integrating the API, building a solid business plan and designing the webpage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of every single aspect of the webpage. Everything works amazingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about integrating into our website frameworks such as polymer, design guidelines like material design, API&rsquo;s, how to get the API to work with our project and polished our other abilities further such as programing in CSS, HTML and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bizpay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next challenge for Bizpay is integrate it into "Ath M&oacute;vil" and expand the different options the platform will offer in conjunction with &ldquo;ATH M&oacute;vil&rdquo;.
