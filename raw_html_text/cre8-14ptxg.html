                <p>
                    Welcome to Project Cre8, the world's first regenerating token system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story of Cre8 begins with the BOMB token experiment, which introduced a deflationary mechanism to destroy 1% of any transferred amount forever. This resulted in the total supply permanently decreasing over time, and thus BOMB was known as a deflationary token. The initial supply of BOMB was airdropped to early adopters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, BOMB token lacks from a decentralized distribution scheme, as well as massive potential for exploitation due to omitting decimals in the total supply.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Tier 0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At project Cre8, we have decided to drastically alter the token system first seen in BOMB as well as other clones. However, Cre8 is not just a single token, but a whole family of tokens which ultimately act to support and balance the supply of our root ERC20 token, Tier 0.  Our main goal is to build a 100% fair and transparent token crafting system with token supplies that are supported by a balance of destructive and creation properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tier 0 is the starting point of our tokenomics experiment. It does not exist in circulation until a user completes a one-time-only claim per address. This prevents the contract creator to have an unnecessary possibility to sabotage contract users. In order to acquire Tier 0, the user must first obtain a referral key from an existing user, enter the key on our Cre8 front-end, and receive a percentage of the remaining supply of tokens not currently in circulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What makes this system unique is that we have implemented a number of mechanisms designed to return tokens to the remaining supply, increasing the amount of tokens that a future claimer receives. One of these mechanisms is a 1% burn with every transfer. The other mechanisms involve the creation of different tokens by spending Tier 0 and returning it to its remaining supply. Each token has a finite maximum supply, however our goal is to find a balance point where the destructive property balances the creation mechanic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Tier 1 and beyond
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tokens that can be directly crafted from Tier 0 tokens are called Tier 1's. Although we begin with a single Tier 0, there can be many Tier 1's and higher. Each of these higher Tier tokens also contain unique mechanisms for distribution, such as a time-gate which requires users to wait longer the fewer tokens remain to be crafted. Over time, more and more tokens will be released, each one requiring a previous tier (or multiples) in order to craft. The opportunities for growth and innovation are unimaginable.
                </p>

                    Extra Features
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a token system, having liquidity and the ability to trade is very import to the success of any decentralized economy. Project Cre8 has utilized 0x's exchange service to create a decentralized exchange specific for our token family. As the list of tokens grows, so will the exchange pairs on the exchange.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges and Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The heart of project Cre8 lies in the solidity smart contracts which makes this system possible. Since smart contracts are immutable, it was important for us to create a concept Tier 0 token that can allow other token contracts to 'hook' into Tier0 and spend Tier0, returning them to its supply, and generating a new Tier1 (or higher) token based on its own distribution mechanic. Early mechanics for token distribution are relatively simple, however, we foresee vast opportunities for creative development of new and improvement mechanics both with experience as well as future advances in technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge to overcome is building a Tier0 that can be integrated into a variety of future tier tokens without worry. Although we plan to launch tokens individually, it is important that Tier0 is built and prepared with other tokens in order to ensure that the linking system works and future additions can be incorporated effortlessly.
                </p>

                    What We Have Available
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today we present to you our Tier0 token which is fully functional, as well as three additional tokens that can only be crafted from Tier0. The Tier1a and Tier1b tokens are created directly from Tier0 while the Tier2 token requires both Tier1a and b to craft. To try out the system, you must first obtain Tier0 either from constructor or claim, then craft both Tier1a and b, then craft the Tier 2. Each token contains a unique distribution and crafting mechanism. We predict that the process for crafting new tokens will be built upon over time.

                    Install
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Begin with npm install and yarn add. The current build utilizes Ganache. Please direct Ganache to the truffle-config.js file in the Cre8/src folder. Enter truffle migrate in Cre8/src. Then use npm start to begin the react app. To launch the 0x exchange, it must be hosted on a seperate port from the react app.
