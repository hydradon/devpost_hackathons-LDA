                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had liked the idea of a bot that responds with gifs, and everything just ran from that point on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a chat bot to have a fun conversation with.  Occasionally it will have funny replies, and if it is confused by your message it will respond with either a gif or pun based on probabilistic weights and a random value.  It can play tic tac toe and prevent you from swearing at people.  If you type something related to games or tic tac toe it will let you play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both already had a basic understanding of making websites, so we made a limited site and found a "phone" template we could use online so that we could get working on the actual bot implementation rather than spend hours touching up borders.
                    <br>
                    We also enjoyed using Brackets for this, the live preview was soooo helpful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half of our team we had planned on dropped out the day before, so we had to spend the first couple hours replanning our ideas.  Also having no experience in Javascript was a small hurdle for us.  We also were supposed to have copundrum.com but the domain service didn't update in time, we left it too late when we get excited about the bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even with most of our team dropping out we still ended up coming out with a mostly finished project in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much more comfortable in Javascript, and the best part is we have a better understanding of how to use Git on projects that have multiple people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Copundrum
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had wanted to add food suggestions using Google's API or other useful tools that the various phone bots provided.
