                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever I feel bored, I feel guilty for not doing anything productive, so we designed a software where a user can spend his or her free time to engage in helpful activities to gain points and gain a position on the leaderboard
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user is given random prompts to help the community. the user can submit photographic evidence of having completed those prompts, and users can rate and comment on others' posts
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app version in python using a graphics module called graphics.py and the website version using html5
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since graphics.py is very limited and unpredictable, we ran into several problems. For developing the rating system specifically, I ran into problems with reading and writing to a text file in order to store a user's rating to certain images.

                <p>
                    We are proud of developing this app with a limited python graphics module: graphics.py
