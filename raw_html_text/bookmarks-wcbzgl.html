                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we need to paste a sticky note to remind our children to do something when leaving home. But it could be very easy for children to ignore. Now with Alexa, why not just leava a voice message? It will make the life easier and simple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill is similiar with a voicemail system, family members can share voice messages each other. Any member can leave a message and other members can listen to it or clear the messages regularlly. Each message can have a valid duration time so that it won't be played when expired. The default expired time is 1 day.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I use Lambda function with Alexa Skill SDK to handle Alexa Intent request and save messages in DynamoDB.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main problem I faced is how to handle the conversation state. In different state, even for the same Intent request, the response message or help message is different, so we need to keep track of the state infomation in the same conversation.

                    This is my 2nd skill and most features are new for me. But I am proud that I finished this skill in 1 week. Thanks for the detailed documents.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that we should always consider the state changes and all possible exception flows in asynchronized operation.

                    In the future, it may be possible to leave a message via mobile phone or accept voice message from friends.
