                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout my life, I have been suffering from ADD and I was always very forgetful. I'd fail my classes and fail to get any of my homework done. I was reluctant to write assignments down because it was always felt so time consuming. It was such a hassle setting the time, date, location, etc. for myself. I wanted to create something that simplified taking down assignments.
                </p>

                    This website gives you an account to store all your assignments for school in one place. Easily create, edit, or delete assignments for each specific day within just a few clicks or less.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website is run off of python using the Flask module for the interactive website. We used RethinkDB to store our data as it was a well-organized interface for our needs. Our navigation bar and information pages are all created by a website maker called Mobirise in order to save some time, but the entire planner dashboard was coded from very basic scratch html. We ran this website off of a Google Cloud Platform server, and our domain was linked using Domain.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A couple challenges that I ran into was setting up the GCP server and linking the Domain.com website. I was pretty unfamiliar with these services, and I had to go through a lot to learn it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am most proud of the fact that I stayed up all 24 hours working on this. I honestly didn't think I was capable of doing it, but the job was done in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've gained a bit of experience on GCP compute servers, which are commonly used in many technological companies nowadays. I've also gotten noticeably better at designing UIs for HTML and improving my efficiency in coding overall.
                </p>

                    What's next for CloudPlanner Pro
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to make the user experience much smoother than it is at the moment. At it's very first stage, every button click loads an entire different page, and I want that to change. Because of the time crunch, I was also unable to add a lot of the buttons that made it easier to navigate the website. Useful features like a back arrow, logout button, etc. would be great.
