                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Talks and histories of our medical friends about lost elderly people that can&acute;t be helped in a proper manner because of their mental diseases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main goal is to build an Android app that can read NFC bracelets that contain general and relevant medical information of the user and show it in a proper manner. 
The bracelets are destined mainly to elderly people (although they can be used by anyone) because they have higher probabilities (and higher current percentage) of getting mental diseases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use android studio to develop the app, using nfc technology and nfc tags for testing.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Being new to the use of nfc technology.
