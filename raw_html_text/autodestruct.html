                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially wanted to try the alexa audio directives and when the Echo Show was introduced I updated the skill to include the video directive.
Just wanted to be funny.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If the Alexa device does not have a screen, Alexa starts a countdown and then the audio of an explosion. If it does have a screen a video shows a countdown and an explosion. 
It's a simple skill.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Losant to drag and drop the actions, and just filled with a little javascript the answers to return to the correct Echo device.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a simple skill, and I see it like a dumb one, yet it's very popular. What started as a simple joke/experiment for me has become a popular skill.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes I don't need to overthink or create something complex for people to enjoy it.
                </p>

                    What's next for Autodestruct
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, I don't know. As I've mentioned, it was a joke, and I don't find a way to monetize it, but maybe I'm wrong and it would be a good idea to receive feedback from other fellow developers.
