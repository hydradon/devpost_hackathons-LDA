                    We wanted to find a way for college students to not be as broke, we realized most people just throw away their bottles and cans, so we wanted to motivate people to help save the earth by recycling and in return they can make some extra money from it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It is a service where you can see how much you can earn from how many cans and bottles you have
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We created our domain and then linked it to a website we created where we have a embedded html that acts a calculator where you input the amount of bottles and cans you have and the output is how much you could earn.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We went into this with higher aspirations and realized what we wanted to do was not doable with the software we wanted to work with so we had to scale our project down many times. Also reeaaalllyyy slow internet was quite a hinge factor in the speed of trying to learn and research how to create our ideas
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learnt how to create a website and deal with domains and stuff around that area. We also we're able to learn a lot about other programs even though we didn't get to use them. Also pretty proud we brought  at least a little of our idea to life.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learnt about the limitations and applications of various programs like Google cloud services and opencv. Also about the workings of a domain and website.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Gain some insight into using more programs and build our idea externally with sensors in recycling cans so using our service can be more automated.
