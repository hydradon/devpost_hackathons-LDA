                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every house has a TV that is under-utilized. We would like to use this awesome screen in almost every home to elevate the voice assistant experience through augmented reality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a combination of a Kinnect and a voice assistant which is much more aware that current home devices. It further enhances the user experience and takes it to the next level at very affordable rate, with minimalist setup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We interfaced an Alexa echo dot with the raspberry pi connected with a PIR sensor and a camera, to achieve the voice interaction, AR module, and motion awareness to the DotAwareAR
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to use Alexa skills. Gathering resources in limited time and interfacing three devices in three different systems into one aware system.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have successfully given personalized commands to echo dot and have learnt and implemented responses through AR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to develop Alexa skills. Augmented Reality through JS. Building Polygons using Three.js
                </p>

                    What's next for DotAwareAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having the camera follow the user using servo motors and motion sensing, implementing facial recognition for user specific queries and responses.
