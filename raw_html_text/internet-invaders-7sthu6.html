                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a mix of the Space Invaders demo and Fruit Ninja. We wanted to make a game that is fun and casual to play, while at the same time being easy to pick up and lightweight, so that it runs smoothly in the browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Viruses and anti-viruses try to get from the top of the screen to the bottom. Kill the viruses by clicking them before they manage to get to the other side. Don't click the anti-viruses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote the bulk of the game code in Javascript, and designed the webpage with CSS and HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard at first to get all the pages to load, especially since everyone in my team was unfamiliar with Javascript and HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are incredibly proud of persevering and finishing the project in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned Javascript, CSS and HTML and how well the 3 of them work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Internet Invaders
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to introduce more elements to the gameplay, such as more game elements, more variation in gameplay etc.
