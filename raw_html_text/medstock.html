                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became inspired when we heard Dr. Peter Pronovost speak at the opening ceremony of MedHacks. He spoke about how 1/3 of a nurse's time is spent looking for supplies, and not caring for the patient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MedStock allows hospitals to cheaply set up a qr-based inventory system for all of their supplies. Hospital employees can then search for inventory and scan to check in or out supplies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Apple's swift, and using an apache server running PHP and SQL to send and receive data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges figuring out how to make the most effective system at a low cost for hospitals. We also ran into problems figuring out how to store the data correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we got it up and running on time. We're also proud that the prototype is ready to be deployed in a medical setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the process of making this product, we learned that huge problems don't always have to be solved with expensive solutions. We can use the tools that we already have, such as iPhones and use them for solving these problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MedStock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the interface and adding more features, such as the ability to print off new labels directly from the app.
