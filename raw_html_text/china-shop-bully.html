                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspirations for this game were classic arcade games, and the idea of how much fun it would be to be a bull loose in a China shop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a single player arcade-style game. The player is the bull, and the aim of the game is to smash as many china as you can, while avoiding being captured by the angry shopkeeper. The game ends when you either get caught by the shopkeeper or escape via the exit. The more china you smash, the higher score you get!
                </p>
