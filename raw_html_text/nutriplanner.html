                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to do something to help people eat healthy with minimal effort. Most calorie tracking apps make you manually input nutrition information. We wanted to make it easier and more convenient to track the foods that you eat. To record nutrition information, all you have to do is to search for what you just ate, and NutriPlanner will search the Internet for nutrition information, saving you precious time from having to remember to look at the nutrition label!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NutriPlanner helps users quickly search for foods that they have eaten and is able to log the food they have eaten. Based on the nutrients the user already has eaten, NutriPlanner's artificial intelligence will help the user decide what nutrients they are lacking and will suggest some food to eat in order to regain the balance of their overall essential nutrients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS for the website, Bootstrap for the page layout, and JavaScript for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Bootstrap was difficult for our team. The constant guess and check of rows and columns proved to be difficult to debug and fix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a website that looks decent for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use Bootstrap to align the contents of the webpage and to format the web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NutriPlanner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to time constraints, this software is currently not finished and we one day hope to finish it. All of the data shown here is not real and should be treated as a sample of what to expect. After completing the project, we hope to add more engaging features to encourage users to eat healthy, such as having win streaks for eating a healthy diet for multiple days in a row!
