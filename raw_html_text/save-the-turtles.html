                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found inspiration unexpectedly from the metal straws DealerTrack was giving out: while we were at their table, one of the ladies said &ldquo;save the turtles!&rdquo; jokingly, and we were hit with inspiration. Not only is saving the turtles and littering in oceans an urgent issue, but it also builds off of current trends among teens, making it a relevant topic that needs to be discussed NOW.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app contains games, statistics, and resources in order to inform others on ocean pollution and its dangers to marine life, as well as encourage others to contribute to change through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first learned the languages we needed to use as a group and then delegated tasks to each individual person to complete. Claire, Cindy, and Yi Ling were each in charge of creating a game that the user could interact with (a focus on javascript), while Maddie was in charge of formatting the app, making the website(using html in repl.it), and creating an interactive chat bot (using html in repl.it). We all started coding our parts individually, but eventually, we all converged and helped each other with their struggles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost all of us did not know how to code in the languages we used for our project at all, so learning the basics of these languages and applying it in 24 hours was a big challenge for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to learn completely new programming languages and connect it our whole idea. In addition, we are proud of our ability to incorporate multiple components into one cohesive app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of coding in javascript and html, as well as what it&rsquo;s like to be a part of a larger Computer Science and Hacking community. 
Additionally, we learned the importance of patience as we worked on our individual tasks and debug our codes several times. 
Furthermore, we learned how important teamwork is; we learned that we should bounce ideas off of each other and catch mistakes that, by ourselves, we would not have seen.
                </p>

                    What's next for Save the Turtles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Save the Turtles aims to improve the transitions between and visual aspect of screens and links in our app, increase the variety of content we have on our app and website, and finally, make our app more accessible to the public.
