                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GiveLight foundation has hundreds of volunteers globally. Today there are various ways in which a volunteer could sign up for this NPO. One being online registration on their website or sometimes just contacting directly to the core NPO team via email, text, verbally etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With online registration, the volunteers are needed to enter basic information with their interests. Volunteers can choose up to any number of interests, making them more generalist. All this information is stored in an excel sheet. Also a lot of the times, core NPO team adds volunteers who have registered offline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While talking with the NPO core team, we realized that how cumbersome it is for them to look for volunteers in this excel sheet and contact them when the need arises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GiveLight core team is looking for an easy way to search for their volunteers. The search could be based on the location, interests etc. They are also looking for an easy way to communicate with the volunteers and engage with them. They are also looking for a platform, where local volunteers can engage among themselves and Create NPO chapters in their local city.

                <p>
                    We are looking to build a next-generation collaborative platform for GiveLight volunteers. The vision of this platform is to empower GiveLight and its volunteers to engage and create a robust online community for themselves.

                <p>
                    Assumptions
Each volunteer signs up with FB login for FB communication
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Platform envisions to provide
Relevant and Seamless search for volunteers using heuristic algorithm
Multi-channel communication with the volunteers. (Real-time and offline communication)
Social media integration since the GiveLight Foundation is very active on FB.
Gamification of volunteer engagement and honoring volunteers for their continued dedicated service towards NPO
                </p>
                <p>
                    Few sample search use cases
Search for an event type:- Building a smart algorithm, to determine what set of volunteers with different interests would be needed to make this event successful. 
Search for volunteers near me:- Ability to communicate with local volunteers and start a discussion to plan events, campaigns, engage more volunteers or chapter discussions.
Search for volunteers based on their interest and location:- General search volunteers

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using MEAN stack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Backend:-
Mongo DB
NodeJs
ExpressJs
External APIs
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frontend:-
AngularJS
Third Party widgets
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deciding on the tech stack to use and set up the environment, We want to be sure that our solution can be easily adopted and maintained by the current developer.
Facebook APIs have very high level of restrictions and needs permissions which takes for days. We were looking to create FB bot or FB webhook to send individual volunteers FB messages since the NPO is leveraging FB to create events etc.
Mongo DB connection on PayPal network would not work. Needed to use personal hotspot to get over the hunch
