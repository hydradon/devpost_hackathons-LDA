                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Identify a low-cost cleaning solution for large numbers of tightly packed solar PV systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application of protective films to protect solar panels from dust and the implementation of a centralised cleaning service
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system require the installation of a roller for each row of solar panels and a set of clamps that keep the interchangeable plastic layer in place. The system has two repositories: one for clean sheets and another for used sheets. Once the repository for used sheets is full, used sheets are taken to an off-site location for cleaning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges was to determine if there is a material that is suitable to use it as an extra layer. 
The plastic need to have high light transmission and resist outdoor conditions.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are prod of organising our thoughts and came up with a solution that is better than our original skecth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learn a lot about solar panels and how to tackle difficult problems.

                <p>
                    Do the prototyping and perform a feasibility study.
