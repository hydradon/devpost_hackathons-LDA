                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like many other college students, we've had multiple chances of being too caught up to go to dining hall, craving for late night snacks but the closest market was out of the way, or having a paper due in the preceding class but printers were 15 mins away walking distance. Our personal past experience of living on a very spread-out campus inspires us develop a peer service application as a solution to create student's convenience on daily basis as well as to promote more fundamental on-campus job opportunities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dormdash treats everyone who is on campus a potential costumer and an employee. A user can toggle between the role of a costumer and of an employee. Each user can set the radius of the delivery system. Everyone within the radius would be alerted with the demand notice. A route to the delivery destination would be generated once the user accept the delivery task. Payments would be made after each success of delivery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use firebase as centralized database, storing information such as time, location, destination and importance for each service request. In terms of route generation, we utilize Google geocoding API to optimize the distance between the requester and the receiver.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Difficulties in updating local data to the cloud database, as well as the difficulties of a promising solution of peer-to-peer transactions.
                </p>
