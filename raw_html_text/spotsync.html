                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us use spotify intensively, and we agreed that we all had moments when we were listening to a playlist and listened to a song that did not match that particular vibe. Or we realized that one song was on two different playlists. In order to solve our problem, we wanted to create a web app such that it can find songs that are similar to a particular one - our automated playlist maker!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's your own playlist builder! Given a song, it plays music that matches vibes with the given input and reduces overlapping songs across different playlists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask as a server in the background to query the results from the Spotify Web API to find songs that are similar to another automatically. Our language was Python, and we needed to scrape through JSONs to obtain playlist IDs to create our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many authentication errors and certificate failures so it was difficult to code on everyone's laptop when not everyone could obtain the correct data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a full functioning website! We were also able to make use of an API and better learned how to use Git.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That UI is very difficult! Authentication things can get super messy and crazy. We learned more git commands (git stash and git clone) and how to navigate through APIs better.
                </p>
