                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Autom8 utilizes various APIs to gather and store market trends for cryptocurrency. These trends and historical market analyses are used to trigger the buy and sale of cryptocurrencies automatically. We added a voice assistant functionality to initiate the bot and set various user preferences that are considered in the trading strategies.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a backend python server that the gathers the data for the cryptocurrencies via API calls. The server uses flask to expose endpoints which are called by the voice assistant and a webpage. The voice assistant was set up using api.ai in node.js and deployed to a Google cloud local emulator through an ngrok tunnel for testing/demo purposes. The webpage was set up in HTML with JavaScript. The server uses various algorithms to find the simple moving average (SMA), exponential moving average (EMA), and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD). These values are used to signal the buy and sale of the supported cryptocurrencies. The purchase and sale will be handled via API calls to the user's wallet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we ran into was finding a way to show it worked in a demonstration, since the bot only worked in real time we needed to find a way to prove it worked by simulating a build at a historical date. Also since the Kraken API we used for gathering data only handled real money transfers we ended up setting up another server that simulated a wallet using a blockchain and wallet API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for autom8
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some features were cut in the demo build due to time constraints. We limited the transactions to Bitcoin only, when we wanted to at least support the 3 most popular coins including Litecoin and Etherium. There are some real money transaction features that would need polish since the current build was focused on the simulated wallet. Overall the entire project could use some more polish to increase user friendliness as well.
