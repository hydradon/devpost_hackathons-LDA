                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that communities tend to get closer after disasters. Sometimes we want to help or ask for help but we just don't know how to.

                    It's an app where people can post what kind of help they can offer to their community on an easy-to-use map. They can offer help like sharing

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AndroidStudio to build our app using
                    <strong>
                        MVC design pattern
                    </strong>
                    . We also used the
                    <strong>
                        BoxMap api
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using the BoxMap api so we ran into a lot of problems.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how fast we've completed the project. We had to do tons of research and most of our project is built around an api new to us.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use BoxMap api, use markers. We're deepened our knowledge in Java and learned how to plan and think faster.
