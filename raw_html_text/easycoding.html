                    Inspiration - Our team did not know many different coding languages as we made our website in only one language, HTML5. We decided to make a website that even we could learn off of. Since our website consists of numerous coding languages, we used some of them to learn ourselves.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - It provides sources that contain websites leading to online courses for all the coding languages. It is a great way for beginners to learn the basics of coding as well as more advanced coding. The best part about our website is that every single link is free!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - First, all of us brainstormed ideas and wrote down different ones in our notebook. From there, we picked the best website that we thought would help people the most. We then used Sololearn as our text editor and started to code from there. When one of us finished coding a certain part of the code, they would copy paste the code into a codeshare.io doc that was shared with all of the team so they could access the code.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - We wanted to make the website more colorful, but we were having trouble making different portions of the website different colors. We wanted to incorporate Javascript, but we didn't have time to learn it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - We were able to move our picture across the website to the right. We were also able to make everything different colors. We stayed up late to reach our goal for the day.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - We learned more of HTML using our website. We also started to learn Javascript.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Easycoding - We would add videos and Javascript now that we know it from our website.
