                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spoken commands are recorded by a web browser and sent to IBM Watson to be processed.
Information returned from Watson is sent to Intel Edison. Edison finds this command's entry in a table of values, and a corresponding group of digital signals are sent to Arduino. Arduino determines, based on the values of these signals, which command to execute. Then, Arduino sends power to certain servos on the robot arm in order to move it in one of many directions.
