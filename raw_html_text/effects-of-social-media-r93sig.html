                    About Us: Our names are Jabili Vishwanadhula and Aliza Borker, we're in 6th grade from WWP - CMS.

                <h2>
                    We realized how much time we spend on social media and how big of an impact it has on our lives.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Our program raises awareness for the dangers of social media by using interactive quiz games. In our program, we made three quizzes, each on one of the most popular social media apps.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    My partner and I used Scratch, a block-coding platform to make this program.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    One challenge we ran into was the unreliable WiFi. When we needed to save our work, the connection would stop and we'd lose all out progress.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    One accomplish we're proud of is how we were able to work independently and then merge our work together. We're also proud of how we worked within the time-constraint.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    My partner and I learned how to work under pressure because the tight time-constraint made us work very efficiently.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We'll research more into this topic and expand our knowledge of it. Then, we will share it with our community.
