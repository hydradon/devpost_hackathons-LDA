                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, we feel that American citizens don't have easy access to the people who represent them in government. We made represent.us to forge a direct communication channel from representee to representative; from citizen to senator. Contacting a legislative official has never been easier, and we hope this tool will allow for more communication between elected officials and their constituents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Step 1: Search your zip code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 2: Choose a representative or senator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 3: Learn about a person who represents
                    <strong>
                        you!
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 4: (optional) Find something you want to talk about with your legislator? Fill out our contact form to send them a note.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: With the current setup, it will not
                    <em>
                        actually

                    send emails to congresspeople if you download and install yourself.
The functionality is there, but one inadvertent test email to a Representative nipped that in the bud prematurely. :P

                    However, test emailing

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By integrating publicly available APIs from Sunlight, Wikipedia, and Govtrack with Node.js and Express.js functionality, we have created a simple tool that makes communicating with elected officials easier than ever before. Additionally, we present constituents with information about their representatives to help them make informed decisions in upcoming elections, as well as provide feedback regarding recent congressional votes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wikipedia's API occasionally has hiccups with ambiguous search terms, so legislators with common names may not have the proper bio section displayed. Additionally, since half our team had never done web programming before, teaching new skills took a good chunk of our time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, we accidentally sent a representative an email with less than intelligible contents while testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our two first-time hackers have a new understanding of a cutting edge technology. Additionally, we were able to fully integrate everything we had in mind at the start of our project! We ended up brainstorming a few more ambitious goals (Wikipedia bios, campaign finance info, etc.) that we were able to successfully implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a useful tool is easy with dedication, great friends, and an eagerness to learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, asynchronous javascript can get really complicated, really quickly.

                    What's next for represent.us
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're looking into also gathering information of state and local level legislators. Having easier access to all levels of government will further enable constituents to make knowledgeable decisions about the people they elect into power.
