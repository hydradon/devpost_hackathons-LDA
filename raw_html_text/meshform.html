                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like robotics competitions, but we sure hate scouting. Keeping track of teams' performances is pesky and tedious work, and is easily made more fun with MeshForm! Combined with garbage internet at every First Robotics event, we had to find a solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scouting app where people record stats about other teams performances. Then, work is merged by transferring data through QR codes(no internet required)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React native and expo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do mesh networking but expo sucks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished sort of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    8 hours is not enough time to create something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MeshForm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate with Google Sheets API so we can throw the information online once you have internet.
