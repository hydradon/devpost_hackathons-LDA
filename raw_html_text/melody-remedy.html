                    Inspiration: We wanted to do some app related to music
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It uses music to provide some level of musical therapy
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used Swift and XCode.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: We had to learn Swift during the hackathon and we had to figure out how to use frameworks. Neither of us have used Swift before.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Being able to push out a functional app within 24 hours using a language we didn't know previously.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned how to use Swift.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Melody Remedy: We will add more features, like trying to implement a feature for active music therapy (essentially letting the user create music).
