                    It helps you to easily create an
                    <strong>
                        immutable

                    bet between you and your friend with a wager as a Macy's Product using Amazon Alexa.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a skill for amazon Alexa using their developer console and used amazon lambda services to deploy it and seamlessly connect it with the web server. We used smart contracts to create an immutable bet between two friends having Macy's products as a wager. We used Macy's catalog-services-api to achieve the same. The web-app is made with vue.js for frontend and we used node.js for backend and integrating it with the ethereum framework.
