                    The Addressed Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every day, a significant number of patients see their general practitioners only to get redirected by them to a specialist. These cases fill up reservation slots, lengthen waiting times, and waste time that would be more valuable to a patient who could actually receive treatment from his/her GP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Medvisor provides an online platform that has two login options: Patient and Doctor. Patients are able to submit their  healthcare complaints, including information about their symptoms and concerns. Doctors, who are only able to login by entering a valid medical licence number (or proof of their licence), can read the complaints submitted by the patients. They can then decide whether these patients would benefit from seeing a specialist, and if so, which one. Through redirecting these patients to the appropriate specialist, or upvoting the previous suggestions for patients who've already been redirected, doctors can help get rid of the intermediary step of going to a GP, making time for those really in need. Also, by receiving medical opinion from multiple doctors online, without having to travel to their GP's practice, patients also save time and money.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our web platform using JSP (Java Server Page) and Google AppEngine's API. We managed our database through Google Datastore (NoSQL). We also used a Bootstrap framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not know until very late, that JSP is considered ancient and is really not the most convenient way to setup a web platform for our purposes.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that we have a significantly large audience who would truly benefit from our idea by receiving effective medical feedback efficiently.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should learn how to use Node.js, Django, or another popular, practical web platform building framework. We also learned a lot about JSP and Google AppEngine.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perfecting functionality and UI. Encouraging Medvisor to be used by countries worldwide, especially developing countries where medical resources and professionals are much harder to access.
