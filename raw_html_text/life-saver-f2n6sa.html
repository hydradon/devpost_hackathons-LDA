                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is an all-women's hackathon, we wanted to address common problems that women face in their daily lives. So we decided to address the emergency when you don't have a pad on you and you are on your period. As women in computing, it is essential to build a strong community of support. So its important to have each other's backs in times of crisis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app connects you to people nearby who have a extra pad on them that they are willing to give you. You can customize your preferences on the type of sanitary products you need. After the person receives the pad, the provider can earn points that they can collect and later redeem for coupons and other products as an incentive to help other women in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to develop the app which incorporates java and xml code. For the graphics, we drew images using Photoshop and integrated that into the app. To keep track of logging in the points after the person receives their sanitary products, we put a built in QR code generator and scanner to connect and confirm that the person has received the product(s) from the provider.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the time constraints given, we could not incorporate a server to allow more than one device to interact with each other. Instead, we hard-coded how the application would look like, if it were to be fully functional with multiple devices. We were also not able to incorporate a database to hold user information from registrations. We did not enable location services yet to calculate distances from one phone to another in order to find people near you since the server was not created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to generate and scan QR codes was a big accomplishment for us. Also just getting more familiar with using android studio and having this as our first project created at a Hackathon. The learning experience is what made this worthwhile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Android Studio as well as how to use GitHub to share a project among teammates. We also learned how other people's codes worked and how to incorporate certain aspects from their code into ours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LifeSaver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LifeSaver has a plethora of doors for opportunity and improvement. Adding additional components like a database to store user information, creating a server for multiple devices to interact with each other, having real time location services calculate and update the distance between the receiver and the provider, and other functions. The Points System also provides room to partner with other companies and organizations.
