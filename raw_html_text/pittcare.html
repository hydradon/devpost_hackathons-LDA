                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Patients don't have easy access to their own data in. Every time they go to a pharmacy, their prescriptions have to be electronically sent to the pharmacy, before they can go there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It stores the patients' information on a blockchain such that it is accessible only by individuals authorized by the patient themselves with the help of a QR code. Every time they go to a pharmacy, they have to create a QR code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I first had to build my own blockchain where I could store the patients' data, and then I had to create an app that could read a patients' QR code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a blockchain was the hardest challenge as this was my first-time experience working with blockchain technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about the blockchain technology and how useful it can be in the field of healthcare
