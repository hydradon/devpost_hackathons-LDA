                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this web application as there was no good tool to compare which bank best meets an individual's needs. While developing, we also realized that visualizing your banking data is very powerful as it really allows you to understand your spending and deposits. So, we decided to combine these two applications and SmartAccount was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SmartAccount first takes in an excel file of your past banking data (this excel file can be easily downloaded from a bank's online banking portal). The web app reads the spreadsheet and provides data visualization of your banking history. This includes graphs of your spending habits, and interest accumulation. The app then suggests based on your transaction history which Banks you would most benefit from. There are many factors that the web app takes into consideration such as the minimum balance required, interest rates, monthly fees etc. in order to make a unique decision for each user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end was developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The back end used Python and the whole web app was put together using Django. The application is hosted on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge we ran into was the difficulty in combining the front end website with the functionality of the back end. We overcame this by using Django to seamlessly integrate everything together in one platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are mostly proud of the data visualization we were able to achieve and being able to deliver this in a simple to use website application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to graph data using python, and integrating it into a website.
                </p>

                    What's next for HackWestern SmartAccount
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps include making the website more visually appealing using more Bootstrap. We would also like to continue adding data to the dashboard such as incorporating Investment accounts in order to recommend which banks users should use for their investments. In the long term, we would like to automate the application so that the app automatically transfers funds to the optimal bank account without the user having to do any of the heavy lifting.
