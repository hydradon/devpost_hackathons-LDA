                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We load and categorize a large number of categorical features from the BRFSS dataset. Then we perform novel EDA on the dataset and then extract features from each category and fit a regression to look at how they predict overall health. We then use all of these features to fit a novel, final model of health prediction.
