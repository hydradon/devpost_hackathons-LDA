                    We wanted to be motivated to do our homework when we were younger. We knew we were also competitive at that age, and the idea that we could compete with our friends for

                    Starstreak would allow teachers to add multiple choice tests and see when students completed it, and with what proficiency. Students would gain access to these tests and complete them quickly, in a timely manner, and with as a high a grade as they can. Teachers can then assign stars to certain achievements - for timeliness or proficiency, etc. Students can see the top five students, and their own rank bolded. Currently, a static prototype is running.
