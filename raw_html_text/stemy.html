                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was inspired to create STEMY by our experiences with young children who we wanted to engage and encourage to learn about STEM.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    STEM is an interactive website that aims to teach children ages 6-10 about STEM topics such as coding, the scientific method, and logic skills. STEMY attempts to appeal to children by allowing them to choose which topic they would like to learn about and presenting them with interactive learning. STEMY teaches coding skills through a version of the game pong, science through 3 experiments, and logic skills through spacial awareness puzzles.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used the platform CodePen to work on the basic, original page designs for each of the 3 branches: coding, science, and logic, individually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing as none of our team members had a lot (or any) prior experience working with HTML and CSS, we ran into a host of small syntax errors while we got used to the format of the languages. Additionally, we ran into challenges while trying to adopt  previously written open-source code for pong into our project. Unsurprisingly, our logic skills game was much more complex to code than we had originally envisioned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to produce even part of a project using languages we are not familiar and comfortable is something that we, as a team, take pride in. All three of us have extensive knowledge and practice using Java, which would have made it the easy choice of languages, but we wanted to push ourselves to expand our skills at this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alongside of gaining new skills in web design, this project has pushed us to learn more about working on projects with other people and the logistics of integrating code written by multiple people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for STEMY
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to add our code to a GitHub repository and launch it to an online webpage. Furthermore, we would like to adopt a uniform style to ensure that each page's theme matches the whole product. We would also like to add more levels to each branch.
