                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from
                    <strong>
                        Starting From the Bottom
                    </strong>
                    of our commute here from GTA and Waterloo, as we ran thru the 6ix we realized that we had a lot of woes and that we did not
                    <strong>
                        Connect
                    </strong>
                    with ourselves well. So we decided our
                    <strong>
                        Motto
                    </strong>
                    for this
                    <strong>
                        Summer Sixteen
                    </strong>
                    Hackathon would be to create a webapp to
                    <strong>
                        Know Yourself
                    </strong>
                    better.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon
                    <strong>
                        Successful
                    </strong>
                    Facebook Login, our Webapp generates a &ldquo;virtual you&rdquo; using your facebook footprint and utilizes indico.io&rsquo;s advance text and image APIs to perform sentiment analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, we apply sentiment analysis on your posts to determine your least and most positive moments, as well as your general happiness. We also classify posts and images via indico&rsquo;s emotion analysis and map them to topics such as
                    <strong>
                        Fear
                    </strong>
                    , Anger, Happiness and Sadness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using indico&rsquo;s text tags and keywords API, we generated a list of interests based on your posts and pages liked. We also calculated your popularity over time by measuring the number of likes on your profile pictures. Using google&rsquo;s chart API, we were able to graph and visualize this data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using Indico&rsquo;s people processing API and facebook&rsquo;s graph API, the app also calculates your top 5 closest friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the image processing side, we used indico.io and Clarif.ai to proccess the facebook photos that you were tagged in. From your photos, our app is able to suggest the top 20 common keywords that resembles the overall theme of your photos, as well as categorize your photos based on the emotions and general atmosphere displayed.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was
                    <strong>
                        Back to Back
                    </strong>
                    issues that we had to
                    <strong>
                        Catch up
                    </strong>
                    from. We tried to pull your full friend list from the Facebook API but we were
                    <strong>
                        Doing It Wrong
                    </strong>
                    as Facebook depreciated that feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge that persisted was trying to optimize the number of API calls we had to make in order to stay under our call limits - especially for Clarifai.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of the asynchronous nature of requests in javascript and calling APIs back and forth - especially with facebook&rsquo;s API, writing clean code and avoiding callback hell was also a challenge to do.
