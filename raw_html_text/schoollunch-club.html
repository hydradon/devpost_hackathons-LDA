                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    We believe that school counselors and teachers should have a website to direct parents/guardians to, so that they can apply for the USDA school lunch program. Now they have an easy-to-use and sharable solution,

                    Like many enrollment sites on the web,

                    helps users complete an application by walking them step-by-step through the necessary information collection process.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the process of collecting a user's information simple and fast by designing a web application that clearly states all the required inputs for the USDA National School Lunch Program and encourages accurate form completion.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User accessibility was our greatest challenge. We needed to come up with a solution that could reach our diverse audience groups and guide them through a somewhat cumbersome application process. With

                    </a>
                    parents/guardians can apply to this wonderful meal program via their mobile devices or desktop computer at work or at home. Basically, with

                    </a>
                    if you have an internet connection you can now quickly and easily apply for participation in the USDA's National School Lunch Program.

                    By making the site accessible via both desktop and mobile interfaces we believe that

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    School counselors and teachers love it. We interviewed several real-world educators and they said, it was an updated solution to a common problem, i.e. getting students in-need enrolled in the USDA school lunch program.
