                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever had worries of how you would look in certain hairstyles that you really like? I get anxious when I am about to get a new hairstyle that I have never tried before. Therefore, explains this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a web based AR that detects a person's face. It allows the user to select any hairstyles that are provided to give it a try on themselves. When that particular hairstyle is on them, they get to decide how they personally look and if they liked it, they can take a snapshot to bring it to their actual hairstylist to have an actual haircut.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app is built with pure HTML5, CSS, Javascript AR library.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges I ran into is trying to get a perfect hairstyle to fit for everybody. The hairstyles are just some free online .png that would do the job for now. Looking at how the Javascript AR library is a face detection AR, it was a challenge to try to get the hair to appear on the head.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, I am proud of what I have achieved from being in a team by myself. Even though the website doesn't look too appealing, the functionality and the idea can bring huge changes to a person's life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I never knew that there were AR libraries for web applications especially from Javascript. In overall, trying to put a website together alone is really fun and not that difficult with the amount of resources online.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve on the AR technology to be more responsive, improve on hairstyles to fit on a person's head more dynamically, provide an opportunity to take a screenshot for future reference of hairstyles to try, better User Interface and Experience.
