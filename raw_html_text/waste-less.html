                    Working in restauration it becomes evident that there is a significant amount of food wasted. Our idea is to create a service that attempts to recover some of that food and to redistribute it. This project was built using the React framework for the front-end, and the back-end database was MongoDB because of its ease of use and it was something new to learn. We're proud of creating a functional working app to show off, but most of all we had fun learning new concepts as a team. Waste Less is a project that we would love to pursue on our free time and hopefully help our city in combating hunger and food wastage.
