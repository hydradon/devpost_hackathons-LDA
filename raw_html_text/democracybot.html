                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is inspired by the various american sites which do similar things, such as resist.bot . We noticed there was no such website for canadian issues, so we created democracybot.org

                    DemocracyBot sends a message to your representative regarding various issues, communicating with you through Facebook Messenger

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by reading the api documentation for Facebook messenger. Because of

                        this
                    </a>
                    great client implementation in node.js we decided on using that for the bot. 
As for the website, it was done in HTML with a CSS stylesheet.  It's very simple and minimalistic, only showing and saying what needs to be said.  It has no bitcoin miners, no ads, and is generally just super lightweight
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, first of all when buying the domain we went through 3 coupon codes, 2 calls to Domain.com and 1 call to my bank, and at the end of the day I couldn't update the CNAME or A Records because it didn't update.
Next, when putting our scripts together, we realized that while we vaguely knew of some problems, we didn't know enough about them to properly formulate letters or summaries, which was resolved after a decent amount of research.
The stylesheet was horrendously irritating to work with, between color codes not doing what we wanted them to, to the font size of the buttons not working, then working, then breaking again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the bot itself, we were learning the facebook API and node.js as we went along, which led to everything taking much longer than it should have. Strange javascript errors and massive lag from the facebook API led to massive frustration for the amazing and handsome man who did the backend code (this part wasn't written by him i promise)
