                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people often face a set of problems while shopping either offline or online. Problems like : fitting size , customized experience , time spent in standing in queues. It all adds up and lead into failure of conversion for the company. 
Our goal was just not to do this. We wanted to explore the future of shopping. Where we can reduce shipping costs , warehouse costs , we could probably replace a lot of salesperson with robots. Having only a few employees at offline stores would work because everything else will be automated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zalando Pop Stores are the Popup shops that dont really sell stuff but acts more like a public display where people can try on the things they like.There are just a few pieces of clothes in every size available and they aren't for sale. They are available just for trials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example : 
Zaalando's Retail store 1 : There are 3 devices in the scenario : A tablet at the entrance will entertain a customer by helping them choose what they want and what is available in the store saving a lot of time and helping them customize the look. 
Device 2 ( for Consumer ) Another device is in the trial rooms which will help a user directly purchase a cloth in the trial room by scanning the bar code on it . The product will be added to the user's cart. If the user has any issue with the fitting or so they can ask for another size from the staff in seconds via the app only saving a lot of time thus increasing product trials. Notification will be sent to the salesperson and they can respond immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Device 3 ( for SalesPerson) - There is one device with admin Dashboard for the Salesperson with data specific to that store. Your staff can monitor and understand your sales with the help of data visualization that we provide about your products.Everything from scanning items, trying products, discarding and keeping merchandise, and more.Customer shopping habits, likes and dislikes, product performance, and fit issues which will then help in managing better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used several sets of technology mentioned in the project details. We went through several iterations and broke down the problem into smaller pieces to understand it completely so as to provide a completely unique solution which was cost effective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major problems was understanding the European market where Zalando prevails.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really think that this can solve a lot of time and money for small business. Also , through this product Zaalando can reach out to both Businesses and Consumers. B2B and B2C will work quite well as Zalando is already targeting small businesses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt about a different set of problems which is not at all considered in regions like Asia. We learnt about thinking  and psychology of customers of an unknown market. We tried to solve the problem by creating a B2B and a B2C product at the same time. This is a unique problem which can solve a lot of problems in the Ecomm market globally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pop Stores by Zalando
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smart Mirrors, AR/VR for trying out outfits in trial rooms without changing clothes. Delivery through bots that'll be cheap and efficient.
