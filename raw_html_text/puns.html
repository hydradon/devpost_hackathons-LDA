                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever need a strongly random number for an on-chain application?
PUNS will be a refinement of part of a system I employed for a previous Dapp, with an effort to make it more re-usable and useful to others developing dapps that need this type of PRNG for on-chain unpredictablity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PUNS uses references to numbers that don't exist yet to define how it will calculate a number in the future. It does so in a way that is too expensive to influence to be practical to attack. It provides reference implementations as a small set of interoperable libraries in solidity, javascript, and (coming soon?) python.
                </p>

                    I haven't yet, because I'm taking the project to EthBoston.
