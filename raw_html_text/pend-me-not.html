                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spend Me Not (SMN) was inspired by a common dilemma noticed among team members: After we receive our paychecks, we're tempted to blow a lot of it away on things we don't need or can't afford. We decided to come up with a mobile solution to combat this situation...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enter SMN! The essential goal of this product is to tell the end user when they are getting close to spending their allotted budget. By linking their bank accounts to the app, users will be able to accurately see how much money is being spent in real time. Not only that, SMN will also send alarms and notifications when you approach or surpass your pre-set "threshold of pain."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is SMN's wireframe. That is to say, it's a HTML5 &amp; CSS3 mock-up of a basic UX with our product.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many members of our team were not experienced in web development and had to essentially learn HTML and CSS overnight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team met these challenges head on and, though we didn't complete our wireframe, everyone is able to walk out of this event with a good chunk of knowledge in basic web development with today's modern tools.

                    This project is free to be built upon by other members of the SharkHack community, however at this time the team has no intentions of further developing the project.
