                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Money is a great incentive for people! So why not reward water and electricity customers by something that is meaningful to them when they reduce their consumption.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users upload their water or electricity bills. Our computer vision algorithm reads through their bills and calculate their consumption savings. Gallons of water saved and kWh of electricity saved are then converted to points. Customers can choose to redeem these points for monetary value (gift cards, airline miles, cash, etc) or donate water credit or electricity credit to poor communities.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technically, the computer vision algorithm was challenging to make it understand the bills.
                </p>
