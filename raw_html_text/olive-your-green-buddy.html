                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solid waste management and recycling culture still needs developing in Africa.
Waste management specifically recycling is still a culture that needs to be developed not only in my country but also many of the third world African countries.My teammates and I thought creating an interactive way of tackling this problem would be taking a step towards the right direction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Olive, connects Facebook users to recycling and waste management companies in the most interactive way possible. She allows you to post a picture of the items you would like to recycle and your location. A recycling company assigned to your area then picks up your location and collects the material on your behalf. She also allows you to recommend recycling companies to other Facebook users.

                    How it was built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Olive was built using chatfuel, we wanted to make the users easily follow the conversation and understand the interaction.
If the user feels they have more to ask than Olive can answer there is an option to get in touch with the team
