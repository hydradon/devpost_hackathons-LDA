                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With one of our team members having grown up on a beef farm, we were inspired to create a tool to help farmers manage their livestock easily and cost efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LIVEstock gives farmers the ability to keep track of breeding information, medical history, and general data by simply scanning the QR code on the animal's ear tag.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LIVEstock was created by building a mySQL database and a web dashboard built with handlebars, bootstrap, PHP, html &amp; CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was getting blocked by security rules while setting up the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our finished product because it is a light-weight tool, cost effective as QR codes are free to create and scan, and extremely easy to implement on a real farm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Laura learned learned more extensive CSS and html skills, how to build a mySQL database on PHPmyadmin, and how to create QR codes.
Dexter learned how to edit security rules- although extremely boring it is very useful and practical for future projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LIVEstock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LIVEstock will be definitely be implemented on a real farm one day- if not for full production then just to show farmers how simple technology can make their lives a little bit easier.
