                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Augmented Reality is one of the fastest growing products in the technology industry, and I was thinking about potential use cases of this that could really have an impact. Then I realized, if AR can superimpose objects into the world according to your view, then this could possibly be used by a medical student to perform a "virtual surgery" which could simulate the real one. A mechanical engineering student could use this Augmented Reality to work on a non-real, superimposed engine. Augmented Reality could be leveraged to give hands-on, almost real-world learning and experience, without any of the troubles of getting hands-on experience other ways.

                <p>
                    Right now, this can only run a small test case that I built, which is a circuit board in which you can connect components, as an example.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it utilizing the magic leap AR glasses. First, I got all the necessary programs to work with the magic leap AR glasses. Then I got the assets I need from the Unity Asset Store. I used the controller buttons spawn the environment and select object. I utilized ray casting from the controller to the real world to place the environment, and then utilized ray casting inside the virtual world from the controller to the environment to see which object was being hovered over.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since magic leap is a very new product, The version of Unity I had to use was a test version, so it still had some bugs and it did randomly crash sometimes. Debugging was also hard due to my laptop having low processing power, causing some lag unless I built and directly imported it to the magic leap AR glasses.

                    Being able to actually make something in AR at all is the accomplishment I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I hope to build more environments, such as the ones listed in the start, because the environment I have built so far is only a small test environment.
