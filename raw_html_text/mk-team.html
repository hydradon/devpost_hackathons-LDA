                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Are you looking to create the best idea ever, but don't have the people or the skills to help you? Or are you just looking to join a dope team, but unsure how to best find a team whose goal and needs line up with yours? Mk-team was our attempt at making it easy to join groups to do anything from solving the world's most pressing issues to creating a 2d version of Mike Myers.

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enter mk-team. Mk-team helps facilitate those initial conversations by offering up potential matches sorted by interests and skills (and other additions in the future). It's a mix of Tinder and Match.com for software (and hardware!) engineers. There are three main pages, modeled after Tinder: a profile page where you can edit your profile, a matching page where you match with other potential teammates, and a matches page where you check out who you already matched with.

                    How I built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of mk-team was written in Meteor.js.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Especially challenging was when we considered how we wanted the front-end and the back-end to interact, in order to get the best UI/UX experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly that we got something working!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UI/UX is so, so important, especially in the case of an app that needs a lot of users initially to even work, but figuring out the back-end that works with an user-friendly front-end can be difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for mk-team:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mk-team has a high ceiling. Although making side-project teams could be based on location preferences for now (just like Tinder), we could also create special hackathon chatrooms that facilitate teammate search for hackathons, as long as they had a password from the hackathon hosts.
