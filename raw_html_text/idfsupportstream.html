                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of the guys in our group are former IDF soldiers, and they understand how difficult it can be. There are so many times when they want to give up, and don't get the support they need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives a twitter, facebook, and instagram feed of supportive messages for our soldiers, and also gives a place to donate money to various causes, and read inspirational stories about other soldiers.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using texteditor, and learning more and more about HTML and CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have much of a background in either, so it was particularly difficult to find a way to make it work, but we did it.

                <p>
                    Having a working final project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How difficult learning new things can be, but also how much we can learn and accomplish in a short amount of time
                </p>
