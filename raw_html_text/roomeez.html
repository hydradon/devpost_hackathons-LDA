                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with Roomeez by just talking to sponsors and thinking about how we could utilize and combine their APIs. The concept seemed like a good way to learn more about 3D rendering and UI design, so we went with the idea and let it grow as we went.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roomeez allows you to browse for the room you are looking for with minimal effort. Users simply enter the type of room and style of design they desire, and the application presents them with several procedurally furnished rooms. Each generated room is furnished with offerings from Wayfair, as provided by their 3D API, and other resourced provided in person by representatives from the company.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we decided on an idea we began looking in to methods of rendering a 3D scene without having the high-end hardware to use traditional methods. We discovered Babylon and the many possibilities it offered: 3D rendering, browser use, thorough libraries, and fair documentation. Then came many hours of learning how we can use the 3D web graphics library to create the project we wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest problem we encountered was understanding the Babylon coordinate system. This came up both early on during the final stretch. We first realized the complexity of the problem when relating local and global coordinates led to the scene generating improperly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we were able to know nothing about 3D rendering and webGL, and then being able to procedurally generate and render an entire scene using Wayfair's API for the objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pains and struggles working in JavaScript, how to work in a 3D environment, how to use the BabylonJS library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Roomeez
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roomeez can be improved by generating more floorplans, more advanced rendering techniques, looser coupling, and iOS and Android support.
