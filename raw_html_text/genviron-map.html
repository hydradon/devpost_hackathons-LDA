                    What inspired us to build this app was the fact that people are continuing to be affected by climate change. With changing weather patterns and more unpredictable weather, its important that we try to predict those patterns and provide an avenue where users can look at the webpage and understand whether or not they are close to bad weather or not. The challenges we faced was trying to connect IBM Cloud to the application and applying a heat map to our map, both of which didn't really work.
