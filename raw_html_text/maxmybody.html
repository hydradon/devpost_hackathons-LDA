                    Max My Body is a product that will fundamentally change the way that parents athletes and coaches look at nutritional education.  The possibilities are there for the future of nutritional education, but the for some reason the majority of the apps created only look at the "adult" experience for nutrition.

                    Gold Level - 2nd paid level
MAX clients with an active profile can use the "real time" meal planning function by incorporating wearable devices during their athletic activity in order to record individual caloric burn rates.  The caloric burn is important because the meal planning data base will "pull" food items into the player profile based on the total caloric burn and the nutritionist guidelines for meal planning.
