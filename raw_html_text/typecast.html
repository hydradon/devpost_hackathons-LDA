                    The capture of Metadata (tagging), when storing electronic documents creates intelligent database mining when information is needed.  Document search results become consistent and relevant, saving time and generating useful business knowledge.  Document management software must have a powerful and automated way to capture metadata.

                    The current challenge from Dracoon, presented us with a way to generalize this problem. Dracoon, a data security company, faces a challenge of finding a specific document in a well-organized file store can still be tedious and time-consuming for employees. Our service aims to provide a handy way to generate these document tags.

                <p>
                    While building the service, we observed that the core idea of comparing information and finding the relevant coefficient can be applied in other areas. We have demonstrated this by building two microservices...

                    A. Given a web URL of a news article, generate a relevancy score. This led us to rank news articles in terms of how good the article is with respect to the title. AKA: Clickbait detector!
                </p>
                <p>
                    B. Curated news. Once we figured out how "good" the article was for the user, we compiled a dynamic billboard of local news article for the individual.

                    The lack of enough training data for "learning deep" makes most non-dimension reduction learning methods useless. Also the pre-assigned "manual" tags for supervised learning algorithms relies heavily on the tags being very accurate and tagged in one particular style, otherwise the loss values will not be accurate and will hamper the learning. The style is very important as the "deep learning" tries to imitate the thinking of the person while giving the tags. As different person have different style and thinking the network might not learn well enough.

                <p>
                    Key Phrase extraction techniques rely heavily on the available corpus and is repeatable with changes in the corpus. Also if the corpus is too small the keywords may not be good. So we went ahead with implementing bagging techniques to improve our key word extraction.
