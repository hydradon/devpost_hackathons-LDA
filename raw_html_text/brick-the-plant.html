                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After putting two random words together, we came to a definitive agreement on the premise of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is simple whack-a-mole based game where roses and dandelions appear on a field of dirt. The goal is to smash to the roses with a brick.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game using the Godot game engine and their GDScript language. We decided to host the game on a website using firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered many challenges throughout the process. We had to weave our way around a software and language outside of our comfort zone. Although we still maintain a few problems such as support for a web browser other than Google Chrome, most of our issues were resolved through the long sleepless night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very pleased to have created eight different levels and an endless game mode, and we are very pleased to have worked through as many bugs as we did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal about Godot software and their native language as well hosting the game on firebase.
                </p>

                    What's next for Brick the Plant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we find the time we would like to add new features such as power ups, and new game modes. We would also love to add cross platform support for more browsers.
