                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After attending the Red Cross First Aid &amp; CPR training course, we learned that it was a
                    <em>
                        lot
                    </em>
                    of information to take in, and the average, normal citizen most likely wouldn't know the information, much less than be able to recall it in an emergency. As a result, we created the First Aid Emergency Guide to help those wanting to learn more about what to do in emergencies and to help spread knowledge about emergencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The First Aid Emergency Guide is a simplistic, but effective, website that has all the necessary basic information needed to act quickly and efficiently in an emergency. We opted for a minimalist design, so in an emergency, where there is no time to waste, the user can navigate the website quickly.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website on repl.it using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this project, we were tasked with creating a very simple but appealing design. Additionally, since none of were particularly skilled at HTML or CSS, we had to learn the language along the way.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon completing this project, we were proud of being able to learn how to code in HTML and CSS and create a fully-functioning website in the allotted time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a design for a website and how to execute it without any bugs or mishaps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for the First Aid Emergency Guide
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding more information to the guide and perhaps turning the website into a more accessible and easy-to-use app.
