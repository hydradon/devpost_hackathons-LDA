                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yelp, Amazon, Consumer Reports. All these sites can help you find how useful, how quality, how trustworthy a product is. This information is easy to find and readily available. In this day and age though, more and more people are concerned with how their choices affect the planet. Arbitrium complies data from the hard to reach places on the internet and displays just how environmentally friendly or unfriendly various companies and products are.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Arbitrium complies data collected by us about the environmental effects of many companies and products across various industries. It allows users to suggest edits and allows us as the authors to easily edit the website in real time through Google Spreadsheets.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website from scratch using HTML, then used an API to compile the data we found into easy to understand tables from google spreadsheets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many challenges. The entire team is new to coding. We ran into difficulties while using the APIs because we did not know what APIs are and how to implement them. We spent a lot of time trying to find accurate information concerning the products found on our website - it took many hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to find all of this data, scattered across the internet. We are also proud of creating our first functioning website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned HTML, website development, and APIs. We also learned a lot about teamwork, and just how toxic a lot of products are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Arbitrium
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wish to add further categories, companies, and products. We also hope to make the website more aesthetically pleasing and with an easy user interface. We also plan to develop an app based on this.
