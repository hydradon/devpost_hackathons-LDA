                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Driving technology change to allow Providers to stay in business.  The (home and center based) Child Care industry is shrinking due to over-regulation. We are completely revolutionizing how Family and Center-based Child Care Providers manage data on a day to day basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    myMAX is an Amazon Skill alongside a live dashboard with reporting capabilities that allows Child Care providers to use their voice to enter data into their database virtually eliminate paperwork. Providers ALWAYS have their hands full and NEED to be able to use myMAX to save them time and money, meet state-mandated data tracking requirements all while helping them increase parent satisfaction.  All data is compiled into an informational daily sheet for a parent at the end of the day disclosing all data regarding the child's day in care.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used all cloud native services from AWS, leveraging node.js in a lambda to back the Alexa voice skill, and using lambda and API gateway to build a REST API consumed by a React JS front end to provide a companion web dashboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges we ran into along the way were related to Alexa actually hearing the right thing (like names) - we used a fuzzy matching system to score and evaluate confidence in matches to ensure complete accuracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are the first, patent pending, voice-activated tool in the Child Care industry. We are taking an industry where multi-tasking was only a dream and now Providers are able to do it seamlessly and effortlessly throughout their day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our customers use this skill 30-120 times per day.  It has very high usage and we believe we can expand this to be one of the most frequently used skills on Amazon.
                </p>
