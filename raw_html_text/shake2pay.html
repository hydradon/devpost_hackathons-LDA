                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an easy and efficient method to make payments. Forget about lost wallets and stolen credit cards. Whether it be reimbursing a friend, paying the babysitter, or making a formal transaction at a business, Shake2Pay provides an innovative and secure way to handle your wealth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shake2Pay utilizes the simplicity of a handshake to complete a transaction. The involved parties, shake hands, with Pebble smartwatches on their wrists. When a handshake is detected, a message is sent to the companion app, from where the server is contacted with the details of the payment, and completes the transaction through Blockchain's API. The payment is made in Bitcoin, which makes it easy to anonymously make payments, in the real world.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Pebble smartwatch was difficult for us to interface with its companion app, due to confusion about how the appmessage method worked. Determining the parties whom the transaction was made between was another challenge, but was one that was overcome through the use of the user's precise location, and the timestamp of the transaction.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud we were able to utilize Bitcoin in an effective and beneficial way. We are also proud that we brought Bitcoin use to the real world, and easily accessible for use in everyday activities. In addition, we feel accomplished as we managed to develop working companion applications for the Pebble smartwatch for both Android and iOS, which increased the access to the service.
