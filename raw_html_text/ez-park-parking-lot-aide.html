                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frustrating experience at the parking lot when going out of town and in a hurry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a parking lot size and spaces occupied (as txt input), it tries to simulate real-world traffic experience and output open spaces in the lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend was built using python and efficient data structures like sets and dictionaries while front-end was built using classic yet golden HTML5/CSS3.
                </p>

                        Team members not having enough technical experience and/or leaving in the middle. Was a little challenging to work on it just by myself :D

                    <li>
                        Front-end development using just HTML/CSS; I'm used to working with frameworks like Angular and Flask.
