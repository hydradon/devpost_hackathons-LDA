                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fdascab reads and interprets csv files given to us by UH's Department of Energy and converts them into easily understandable line graphs. It supports any time interval for any given number of buildings and is dynamic and scalable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Python Kivy package as well as matplotlib to develop this program, splitting the data interpretation and user interface up among our members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us had never used Kivy before, and so we learnt the intricacies of the package from the ground up. We all came together to help and support each other where we needed it most.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a working, scalable program that upholds data integrity to the highest degree.

                <p>
                    More advanced features such as anomaly detection, comparative analysis, and goal comparison.
