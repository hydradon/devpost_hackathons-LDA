                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The wait for an ambulance is often a long and stressful time for the patients and the people they are with. This app was inspired by the need for immediate medical assistance while patients wait for the ambulance to arrive. Our team recognizes that every second counts and with lots of medical professionals around, there's always someone nearby to help.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is used to call the nearest medically trained professional to help assist in a medical emergency, while simultaneously being connected to the 911 operator.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built using an android interface, but is compatible with many other mobile operating systems. For this example, it is being displayed on html interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the team have little to no experience with coding or programming. Also, we had difficulty determining where this application should be implemented, whether this be on public transportation, universities, or to the general public.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to come together as a team and hone in on everyone's own skill set and ability to create a new application with life saving effects that everyone agreed on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned that in order to progress and create a successful product, regardless of time constraints, it requires a lot of risk taking, asking the right questions, and focusing on the purpose not the product.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step is to develop the application and begin pilot testing in universities.
