                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Why should girls get all the likes? Statistics say that girls end up with more likes than guys. So we decided to make a machine learn what makes a picture popular and help guys get more likes by choosing the right picture!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our machine learning algorithm helps you gauge the popularity of your image. You have to upload a potential profile picture and it will let you know if the picture will be popular or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we crawled for images and associated likes from my friends list. Then we converted images to n[d] vector and used the radial vector machine to train and predict using the fed image data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Normalising the data set, reducing the data dimensions of the image data to enable it to run within given hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tried implementing neural networks. 
P.S. Also, we found that number of fake profiles in FB(Its a whooping 83 Million- 1/10th of world population!!!!!!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neural networks, machine learning, crawling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hot || Not
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You would no longer have to waste so much time in choosing a popular profile picture. The algorithm will pro-actively suggest what image to use. It is also useful to photographers to choose the best photographs.
