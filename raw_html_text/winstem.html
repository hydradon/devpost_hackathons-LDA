                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recognize the struggle of being underrepresented as a woman in the STEM fields and we wanted to help women get the support they need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program takes information from the website form and sorts it to match students with a study buddy who is in the same class and attending the same institution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the website using wix and linked it to the form that women can use to sign up with. We wrote the program that matches students using the coding language java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulties trying to transfer the information from a form into our java program. This was solved by using a different form system and downloading the results as a csv. Another difficulty was getting started. We didn't know what our first step should be. We overcame this by asking for mentorship and doing some further research.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of developing a program at our first hackathon. We were unsure of what to expect from this experience and we had little prior experience, so we were worried we wouldn't have a finished product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how we can turn a vision into a reality, from planning to the executcution of our ideas. As first time hackers, we learned about APIs and how they can be very resourceful. We also learned about many companies that promote women in STEM. We hear about most of these companies on a day-to-day basis, but we didn't know how software based they actually were.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WinSTEM
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to make the website and sorting program more automated, so that there is less manual input. We also would like to improve the UI of the website. This is a basic implementation of our ideas, so given more time we would like to increase the overall performance of the website and program.
