                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Exams. Co-op. Extra-curricular activities. Hackathons. Being a millennial today can get extremely busy and making time to do what we're passionate about can be difficult. We have always been interested in investing but it is hard to find the time to research trends and watch the market for when to buy and sell. So in comes Coincise.

                <p>
                    Coincise is an investment management platform that allows consumers to buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin using the Coinbase API based on recommendations given by a deep q-learning agent. Our website displays charts that illustrate the bot's forecasts and compares the predictions with actual market value.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With ingenuity, we applied UI &amp; UX principles to create a website that would appeal to our target market. In the bankend, we use Tensorflow to build a recurrent neural network and the agent trains itself with data from GDAX using reinforcement learning.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering enough data, using new languages such as Python, and connecting the front and backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our bot can accurately predict the market trends.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work together as a team and manage our time effectively to finish our project while still having fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Coincise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to implement sentiment analysis to improve the algorithm used to project future market values. In the short term, cryptocurrency prices are effected by the media and herd mentality so performing sentiment analysis would help give our consumers better recommendations.
