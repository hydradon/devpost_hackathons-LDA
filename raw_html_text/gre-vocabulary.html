                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first ISP skill. Most of the samples are talking about lambda functions. I had to do some changes to those samples enabling me to use my own server and framework for building alexa skills.

                    I will be adding more features to the app - e.g. revise words in a session, mark a word for review, rating words as easy, medium and complex. etc.
