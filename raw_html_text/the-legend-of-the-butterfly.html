                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the inspiration came from encryption, where I was very interested in the different relations and how double variable distribution works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically performs quite poorly and specifically until the double variation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used... python?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly syntax errors and complications
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely the double variable distribution, it was simply complex.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That group discussion on choosing a topic should happen early
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Legend of the Butterfly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably more cleaning up on the story line and quiz.
