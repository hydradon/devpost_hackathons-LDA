                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project was our experience as volunteers at Hackital
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is an interactive visual novel that you can play for fun.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the project using Renpy
                    <a href="https://www.renpy.org/" rel="nofollow">

                    which is a visual novel creator written in python. It was built in our free time when not helping other people at the registration test.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we ran into was time, as we were busy helping others. We also had a few issues with handing off code between shifts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were happy to be able to add real images from Hackital this year into our game to make the experience more specific and realistic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a new game engine for creating visual novels. We also learned that visual novels are an effective way to communicate a message and are quicker to develop than a full video game.
                </p>
