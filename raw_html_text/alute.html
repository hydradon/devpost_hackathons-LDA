                </h2>
                <p>
                    When working on enterprise level environment, it was a hassle to manage multiple resources in AWS and checking their performance without the help of a 3rd party tool. Without an external tool, a developer has to login to AWS console or cli, go to appropriate service dashboard and check the appropriate stats of the resource. I wanted to reduce these steps and help save some troubleshooting time.
