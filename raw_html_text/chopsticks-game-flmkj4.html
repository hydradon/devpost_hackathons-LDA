                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chopsticks is a game which I have had fun playing, and I wanted to create a similar experience for many people.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chopsticks is a fun game in which you manipulate quantities typically held on users hands in order to hopefully send your opponent to the state 0,0. Valid moves including adding the quantity on you hand to the quantity on an opponents hand (in mod 5, ie. if you overflow past the number of fingers on your hand subtract 5 from your hand's number of fingers) and redistributing your own fingers (a hand with 1,4 could transform into a hand with 2, 3 for example). 
This Alexa skill takes the game to an engaging new level. By verbally playing against a skilled opponent, this simple game will give you a new challenge. Will the skill help you improve your memory? Visualization techniques? Simply provide you with a quick relaxing and fun game to play? 
This skill may appeal to a wide range of people, and you are encouraged to play it!

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    This was built in with an AWS lambda function written in python.

                <p>
                    As a first time user of AWS lambda functions, it took me a while to figure out how to set up effective communication between the user and the computer.

                    What's next for Chopsticks Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chopsticks is typically played in modulus 5, but over the years I have come up with many variations. Having alternate versions of chopsticks (mod 6, changemod etc) could be very fun. It might also be useful to have a better set of help functions for beggners.
