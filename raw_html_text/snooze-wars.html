                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of apps that try to motivate you to stay away from your snooze button to promote wakefulness, and none of them seem to have gained any traction, so we wanted to put our spin on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app pairs two users who set alarms for the same time so that when one user snoozes their alarm, the other's alarm goes off and vice versa. The back-and-forth snoozing ends with one user declared the "winner" after snoozing a certain number of times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an Android app, with a Python server script back-end to manage pairing users
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team had limited experience with back-end programming and working with Android, so almost every feature added took a substantial amount of time to implement.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything. We all learned new skills and made a product that we think looks pretty good.
