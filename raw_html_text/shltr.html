                <p>
                    Homelessness is a larger global issue everyday that required our immediate assistance to address and control. Many global agencies are running out of resources to help the growing number of those in need, resulting in a demand for a solution that will prevent people from entering into they system to begin with. We are proactively accessing a users risk of becoming homeless based on their personal spending habits and personal information that studies have proven lead to a higher risk of homelessness. Because homeless can impact anyone, at any given time, we are confident that the community will be sympathetic to those in need, and willing to donate to their causes to make a difference.

                    <p>
                        Allows residents to view their RISK score (Low, Med, High) based on responses. The RISK score is generated using logistic regression model.
Residents get actionable steps based on the RISK score allowing them to mitigate it. 
Allows residents who fall under HIGH risk to create crowd funded financial help.
Leverages Beacon technology to enable community members to donate towards these crowd-funding accounts
