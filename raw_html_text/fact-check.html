                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw the increasing amount of biased and unreliable news in the media, and we wanted to eliminate the spread of false information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website collects data from 5 various news sites such as CBC, Fox News, New York Times, etc., and displays the summary of each of them neatly for the reader to see. The reader is then able to see the differences on how the event is reported between each of the websites, and can make a decision on what they choose to believe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a news API to collect data, which is then displayed on the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fact Check
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we hope to incorporate machine learning so that the website itself is able to determine what is fake news, instead of the reader having to make a decision themselves.
