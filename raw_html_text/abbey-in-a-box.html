                    Inspiration: We were inspired by being in such iconic space. Being at Abbey Road Studios means a lot to us and we decided to recreate the space for anyone who wishes toimmerse and  virtually reproduce spatialized audio in it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It allows you to enter Abbey Road's Studio 2 Live Room, choose from a number of instruments that would reproduce a stem from a previously recorded track. Then, the user is able to send the track to a specific location in the room using the spatial audio speaker setup.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: we built the replica of the room with Sketch Up. We imported this design into Unity and added the instruments (objects). We are reproducing the audio with Reaper and we linked each object to a specific instrument (track). Using OSC messages we are telling L-Isa which track to play, solo, and mute and which speakers to play from.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: we had never used Unity or L-Isa, so learning both software from scratch was a big challenge. Considering that we unfortunately were not able to receive mentorship on Unity. Creating objects in Unity and sending OSC messages from Unity to L-Isa in order to control different parameters concerned with spatial audio were also some of our biggest challenges.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: we are proud to say that we made our original idea become a reality using software we were not familiar with. Our project is immersive and it makes use of spatial audio and the hardware and software provided by some of our sponsors.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: we learned to use Unity and L-isa, we improved coding and design skills, and learned to troubleshoot with C# language.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Abbey in a Box: we want to make it an AR experience so the user can use their phones to choose the intrument they'd like to listen to and send it to a speaker in the room.
