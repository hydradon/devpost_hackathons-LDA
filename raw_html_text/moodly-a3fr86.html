                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students we are familiar with stress, and we know that many students have difficulty managing it. Some of us have experience with physical mood tracker calendars, where you color in each day with an emotion. However, the issue with these is that it is hard to look back and diagnose the true cause of ongoing negative emotions. Therefore, we decided to create an online calendar where users enter in a color as well as a reason for their daily emotions. Although we gleaned inspiration from our experience as college students, Moodly is intended for anyone who wants to take charge of their mental well-being.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When a user visits the Moodly website daily, they see a question asking them how they feel, with six options to choose from - happy, anxious, sad, angry, excited, and content. They are also asked to input a reason for why they are feeling this way. This information is displayed in each day of the week in the Calendar section, so that they can later look back and determine root causes of negative emotions. The Resources section displays information about websites that promote mental well-being to provide support for those who need it.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Microsoft Azure with Eclipse to create a website, and we used Github as a collaboration tool so that we could all work on the project. We used HTML and CSS to design an intuitive website and integrated JavaScript to add functionality for the interactive Calendar display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was deciding which platform to launch our project on. We decided on Microsoft Azure to create a website through Eclipse. Additionally, we had difficulty with storing user input such that we would not lose the inputted information when refreshing the page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to successfully integrate Azure with Eclipse and Github. We are also proud of the fact that we were able to work together to create a working website in a short amount of time that promotes awareness about an issue we strongly feel is overlooked in today's fast-paced society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how difficult it is trying to program in an IDE we were unfamiliar with. With the help of Dubhacks mentors, we were able to better grasp web development and integrate HTML, CSS and JavaScript together to create one coherent website. We also learned that it is beneficial to fully plan out ideas when working on a new project in order to avoid running into unexpected issues in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Moodly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to develop this into a fully-functional app or website that is accessible to people all over the world. We also hope to create a mobile version with easy-to-use, one-click way for users to record their daily data. With this data and other external data, we hope to add analytics and machine learning to develop patterns and recommendations. We also hope to be able to allow secure account creation for Moodly so that users can have their personal information stored and managed securely. This way, they are able to confidentially analyze their mood patterns over time.
