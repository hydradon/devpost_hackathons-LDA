                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I greatly enjoy cubing as a hobby, so I wanted to create a project that simulates a Rubik's cube.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tracks all the pieces of a Rubik's cube when you move the pieces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with Java by using two classes that simulate corner and edge pieces and built those into a third Cube class that has two arrays that contain all of the pieces and simulates moving the pieces.
