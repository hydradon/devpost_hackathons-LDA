                    Inspiration
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grew up loving fine arts, and playing two instruments. However I always have an appreciation/respect for science. Finding the intersection of art and computer science is never-ending quest, but I think that artistic computing is a start.

                    What it does
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Python file takes the MIDI numbers, from the Song Pi file and creates a unique pattern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How I built it
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first read the sheet music for popular melodies. (Three are featured. (1) "Mia's Theme" from La La Land (2) "Hedwig's Theme" from Harry Potter (3)"Marimba" iPhone ringtone.) I translated those notes into MIDI notes, and coded those into Song PI.  I added those MIDI numbers into a list in Python and worked with turtles to produce unique shapes and colors in a window.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges I ran into were finding a way to randomize the colors, making sure each pattern would not overlap, and finding a way to translate a notes duration into the pattern.
                </p>

                    The final product, color from code is what I'm proud of.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the basics of Song Pi, which is pretty easy to catch on to.
                </p>

                    What's next for Art the MIDI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In future, I hope to create more complex patterns, and incorporate not just melodies, but whole  scores.
