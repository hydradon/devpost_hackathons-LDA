                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As you know, cost of acquisition is a major concern for solar companies across the spectrum. Whether you are the size of Sunrun or a smaller mom and pop, it costs a lot of money to acquire customers. We thought it'd be great to see if it's possible to qualify a homeowner without talking to a person.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses api.ai's natural language processing to classify and then qualify or disqualify the most critical solar qualification criteria
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a dynamic conversation flow that maps a user through a standard lead qualification flow, while gathering lead information along the way via a customer lead engine. To make the conversation natural and conversational, we used a Natural Language Processing AI library, which we wrote a customer wrapper around.

                    <li>
                        Just getting the AI to talk at all was very difficult
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Styling the application with the non-standard small chat window was tricky
                    </li>
                </ol>
