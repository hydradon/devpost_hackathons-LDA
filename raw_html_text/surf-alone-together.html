                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I LOVE SURFING. I was actually inspired by my sister and my friend who both surf with me but are looking for very different conditions. My sister hates the crowds in SoCal, but my friend who just began surfing was looking to find surf buddies. Thus Surf Alone Together was born!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Surf Alone Together allows its users to access surf forecasts as well as the live surf environment, that is, how many people are in the water. We also allow users at the beach to upload photos of the ocean to provide live surf conditions to those thinking about hitting the water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in a team of 11 using React, .Net, and SQL. We also utilized IBM's Visual Recognition tech.

                <p>
                    Right now, we are a web app, but we are planning to transition SurfAloneTogether into a fully fledged mobile app.
