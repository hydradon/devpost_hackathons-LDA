                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from a game many are familiar with and may have played at some point called "assassin." Essentially every player is given a target which they will try to find over a however-long period of time and "assassinate' them. So at any given moment you will have someone you are trying to find before someone else finds you. This game has been the subject of large events over the years and has many variations to its name but never has there been an app to help facilitate it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app will allow for players to choose to join ongoing games or create games of their own. Once the player joins, they are automatically assigned a player to find on their smartphone along with a radar pointing to were they are in the predetermined boundaries. They will then have to navigate their way through their campus, city or neighborhood and try to locate their target. Once located the user will have the chance to tag their target by swiping up on their face on the app and send a notification to the target that they've been tagged. The player then earns points and can then carry on with their next target while their tagged target must report to a "respawn zone" to continue with their game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift to code the front-end which currently consists of a map that will follow the user on the map as they walk towards the preset pin on the map. Once the user is close enough, they have the option of clicking the tag button and send a notification to themselves that they've tagged the target. Later code will incorporate our back end to connect other users and allow for much more functionality in the app.
                </p>

                    Some challenges we ran into was learning the protocols to program iOS apps in swift.

                    Incorporating other users and adding navigation to our app so users can see their profile and statistics. Additionally there will be matches which users can join and play with others.
