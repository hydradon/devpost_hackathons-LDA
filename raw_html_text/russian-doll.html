                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a unique 3D Platformer that incorporates Unity's extensive physics engine. We were also partly inspired by the game 'Katamari Damacy' to create a growing player that fit in with the theme of Russian Dolls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game that requires the player to balance a wobbly character with realistic physics through increasingly difficult physics puzzles. The player will also hop into larger Russian Dolls and grow in size to overcome larger obstacles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity as the game engine, programmed in C#, and created the art in Blender.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all fairly new to the intricacies of the Unity physics engine and some of us were new to Unity entirely, so there was a lot of learning to do to make the game we wanted to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing all the game features we were able to. What we have is basically a working proof of concept and all that's necessary to do from here is add a little polish and create actual levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Unity's physics engine and Unity scripting in general. We also learned how to incorporate art and 3D models made in Blender into Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Russian Doll
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add some polish (UI, save games, main menu, aesthetics) and design actual levels.
                </p>
