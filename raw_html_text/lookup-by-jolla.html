                    Have you ever sat at the airport terminal alone, wondering if other friends or acquaintances are also at the same terminal? Or possibly the next terminal over? Potential reunions have never been easier!

                    When you log into the app via Facebook, you can locate your friends that are within a mile radius to you and also logged into the app. Your friends' locations are plotted on a map that is refreshed based on socket connections. By showing you where your friends are, you can message them and use TripAdvisor to find nearby restaurants to meet up at.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are using sockets to check connections. When a new connection is made, your Facebook friends that are also online are notified. The socket also emits your current location to the server, which is how the Google Map marker is created.

                    We first want to create a mobile app version that utilizes AT&amp;T's API to make calls to friends. We also did not realize that Facebook's username is no longer available through their API, so we want to implement a private chat function.
