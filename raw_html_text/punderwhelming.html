                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got here, we didn't know what we wanted to do and were unprepared before hand, so we picked something near and dear to our hearts, which was memes. Unfortunately, meme auto generation is difficult, so we settled with puns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses a Markov predictability to break up sentences and mangle them back into "sentences". There is a pun generator button, an Markov "enhanced" generator button, and a Markov "enhanced" Bee Movie quote generator button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using C++, JavaScript, and the Wix Editor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meme auto generation is hard. Sentence structure is hard. Servers on Google Cloud Platform are hard. Anything with Domain.com is really hard/expensive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our artiste, Ethan Craig, who also does portraits in MS Paint for free (but only for the first one).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meme auto generation is hard. Sentence structure is hard. Servers on Google Cloud Platform are hard. Anything with Domain.com is really hard/expensive. Humor is not copy-paste. JavaScript is nifty. PHP is weird. Free doesn't necessarily mean free. Google Cloud Platform is really forgiving.

                    What's next for Punderwhelming
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Homophone pun generation using things that work. Maybe.
