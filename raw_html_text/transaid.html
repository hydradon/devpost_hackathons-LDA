                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A member of our group took the bus for almost 2 years, without the use of a phone and experience in taking the bus. As a young student, he had to travel to the various parts of the city of Brampton in order to complete his tasks and extracurriculars (volunteering, etc.). He saw a huge problem in the system the transit used to make the riders aware of the upcoming stops, which is why our group decided to solve the problem for the numerous people out there who can still travel to wherever they would like too, without needing to rely on mobile devices or the poor communication between the transit stop awareness program and the riders.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The solution we created is called TransAid, and it operates through lights and noises to represent the buses progress through its routes. The route of the bus is shown on a map with a representation of its route on it through LED lights representing the stops on the route. As the bus moves along, these lights would blink to show that the bus is approaching the stop and would stay on when the bus has passed the stop. The buzzer in the hardware also creates an auditory signal, a ringing sound to signal the bus approaching a stop.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The transit aid was built using an Arduino Uno. The Arduino is a microcontroller that allows us to build projects that are only limited to our imagination. We wanted to change and resolve daily life problems that people face while travelling. So we built a visual representation of what can be implemented in transit to assist people. Firstly, we brainstormed ideas. Then we used a circuit designing EasyEDA to prototype the circuit and design it, this allowed us to pre-plan our circuit in order to prevent any problems which may occur. Later we had built the circuit and soldered and created a case for the TransAid. We used wires to build the circuit and then connected it to the computer and coded all the functions like the blinking, and how rotating the dial will stimulate a GPS and will give us the number for the lighting the lights. Then we took a bristol board and simply implemented this design by carving some parts and putting the lights on it to make it look realistic, similar to an actual transit helping device as seen on subways.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced many challenges in creating our project, having struggles in coding the timing and application of hardware with software meant that a GPS module could not be implemented, a limited amount of time and insufficient amounts of skill meant that an app could not be developed or created to our satisfaction.

                <p>
                    We were able to attain our goal of creating a better communication system of bus stops for the bus riders.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We enhanced our coding skills and our interpersonal skills and we also got a chance to improve our ability to solve problems/
Throughout the hackathon, we learned how to work with Arduino
