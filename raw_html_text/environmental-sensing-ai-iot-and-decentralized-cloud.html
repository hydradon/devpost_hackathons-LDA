                <p>
                    Leverage technology to support sustainable environment goals. For example, counting the number of salmon during a salmon run is very important, and a sensor node with computer vision capabilities at the "Edge" powered by technologies such as the Intel Neural Compute Stick and open source software provides a good option. In addition, the distributed cloud integration with DeepcloudAI (

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrates leading technology components to create a powerful combination to address environmental challenges. Specifically, uses a camera board on a Raspberry Pi for video capture, processes that video through the NCS, posts the analysis output to the asp.net core based website hosted in a docker container in the Deepcloudai platform.

                <p>
                    Got an Intel Neural Compute Stick (NCS) to work with our Ubuntu desktop and a Raspberry Pi. Created and deployed an asp.net core app in a docker container into the decentralized Deepcloudai platform.

                <p>
                    A quick start into leveraging the NCS for edge-based AI, and using a decentralized cloud through docker container deployment. Also learnt more about the use of blockchain in provisioning services.

                    Explore how "Blockchain" can be used in the managing an environmental sensing network with a distributed cloud. There are examples of how Solution architectures like Supply Chain Track and Trace can be implemented with blockchain in a central cloud.
