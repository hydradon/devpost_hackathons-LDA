                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make a project that would help streamline the arduous process of organizing events with your friends. Another thing we were trying to accomplish is to get people's sense of community stronger by giving people the option to join public events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A person signs into the app with their phone number and once they're in, they can create an event (public/private) and choose the location for it to be held. Once that's done, they can invite people to the event. Also if the event is set to public anyone can join the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is build using Swift using Xcode. The backend consists of Firebase and Twilio. Firebase stores the events, lat-long of the people and also stores all of the user-info.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main road-blocks was overcoming the delay we received in fetching data from Firebase. There was a 2 second delay and we had to work our code around that to ensure our data had arrived in its entirety. Also only one of us had access to a Mac so it made it hard for everyone to contribute equally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main thing we're proud of is the skeleton we have setup. We have put in the core functionality that will be used by the app regardless of what UI changes we make. Essentially the backend of the app is almost completed, while the front-end may be a but lacking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For next time we may have to use a language with cross-platform functionality such as React Native because anyone can code it in any type of OS. Also when faced with a particularly challenging problem, taking a step back and reassessing the situation helps a ton.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CVents
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we can polish up the back end more in terms of performance that would improve effieiency and also a major UI overhaul would be useful, as we make the app more visually appealing. As for the end game, having this app on the App Store would be very beneficial.
