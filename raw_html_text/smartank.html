                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming from UC Merced, our school heavily emphasizes the importance and relevancy of agriculture technology in a modern economy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whilst methodically roving farm land, our robot probes the soil to record moisture levels at regular points. This allows us to construct a base of data that would otherwise require thousands of sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We retrofitted an old RC tank with an Arduino and newer control systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges included managing our power supply because many of our components required higher amperages than our components could supply.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SMARTank
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tasks include generalization and optimizing of our power supply capabilities.
