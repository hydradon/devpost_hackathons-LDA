                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something to inspire people to keep learning art.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incentivizes users to participate in community driven weekly challenges relating to art.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built with React Native for mobile devices, React for the webapp, and we used Google Firebase with GraphQL for backend features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of time brainstorming all the way from driving to the competition to being 7 hours in the competition. Getting a good concept that was fairly new yet still strong and impactful was a great challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a solid brainstorming session requires you to really get down and be fine with spitting out even bad ideas. What matters the most is the thinking about what makes an idea good or bad versus the idea itself. One issue we had was that we kept having good but complex ideas once we realized that everything went much more smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for art-mingle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scale. Right now our most optimal experience is tailored towards small groups of friends working on a weekly challenge together. However we'd like to work a little more on a more global leadership board separated in terms of skill level, location, and other factors to help create a larger community.
