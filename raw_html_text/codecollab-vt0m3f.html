                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to do this because we are coders ourselves. We are constantly working together and thought it would be fun to build a tool to help us do just that. With that in mind we set out to do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows multiple people to edit one piece of code, share their session and compile the code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have dreams and I am soo proud of what the team accomplished.
1.Edit code
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Compiles but must be manually sent, we got the compiler to work
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Divides into sessions and sessions can be shared via a chrome extension
4.Chrome extension
                    </li>
                    <li>

                        We ran into challenges putting the entire system together, parts work independently. Compiler works in insolation.
