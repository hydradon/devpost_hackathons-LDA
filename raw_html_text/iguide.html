                    Motion-disabled people have a hard time working on computers which are widely used these days. We are making a system in which motion-disabled people can use their eyes to select the option on the computer and can use it just like a normal person would use a computer.

                    When a question with four options is displayed, the user can look at the correct answer for 2 seconds to answer the question. The user will then be asked to confirm the answer and if he will look at yes for 2 seconds, the answer would be submitted.

                    We developed a three-layered architecture to interface between eyetribe device and web application. There are three modules which communicate with each other to acheive the proper synchronization and response time.
