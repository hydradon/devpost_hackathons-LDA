                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Indonesia has many great scenery, from sea to forest. On top of that, Indonesia has great culinary and culture that can make tourist interest to come. But, our tourism promotion is number 108 of 187 countries (using printed media). There's a chance to improve our tourism business using VR. Therefore, we built Indonesian tourism scenery using React360. This app is called 'Kuy360', 'Kuy' means 'come' in a Indonesian slang and 360 mean we can see whole information in 360 degrees.
