                <p>
                    Learning new languages can be a daunting challenge. Students often feel overwhelmed and stressed when it comes to expressing themselves in a language they barely know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From our experience, language learning can be difficult because one cannot see the immediate reward when putting in all the effort. The reward usually comes after years of diligent studying - the ability to comprehend a language other than their mother tongue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our solution to this problem is to gamify and make language learning interactive by converting it to a fun and social exercise. Teachers can create assignments online, which are visible for their students. Students submit their posts and upload them to the class dashboard for everyone to see. Students can read their fellow students' posts and can peer review it by submitting comments, upvoting and giving rewards. Gamification is achieved by collectible trophies and finding keywords in people's post which they were required to put in any shape way or form.
