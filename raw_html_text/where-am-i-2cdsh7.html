                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever got lost somewhere even though there's a map? Yeah, that's happened to me, too. GPS? Well, it definitely won't be very effective in a building. With the option of augmented reality, I was inspired to create a mapping system that could help people navigate maze-like structures with ease.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Vuzix Blade glasses, I used augmented reality to guide its user in a friendly manner. It recognizes pre-posted posters in a building to determine the user's location. For instance, if it sees a blue poster then it knows it's in the north corner of a building. The user interface is composed of arrows pointing to directions such as the info desk and the exit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Vuforia on Unity to create the augmented reality simulations for the glasses. Through 3D objects, Sprites, and others, the glasses were able to recognize a poster and project directions. I also used Vysor to help in development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, I tried to use Android Studio to create an augmented reality app that could be upload to the glasses. However, it involved a confusion installing process of its SDKs and the fact that I have never used Android Studio before made everything harder. Eventually, I resolved to Unity, but I have never used Unity either. As a result, learning how to navigate the software was another challenge I faced. The most difficult part though, was the C sharp scripts for Unity. I was stuck for hours trying to write a script in which with a tap of the glasses, the augmented reality would change into something else (for instance, it originally showed arrows for directions, but with a tap of the glasses, it would change into the history of the place, then with another tap, it would change back).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never used Unity and Android Studio before and I have zero experience with augmented reality. So I'm proud that I was able to learn something and create it within 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use Android Studio and Unity. As well as augmented reality, Vuzix Blade glasses, and SDKs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Where am I?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a future direction for this project, I want to sync it google maps so that it can navigate on the streets as well as indoors. For instance, they can replace the GPS systems on cars that require the driver to turn their head which can divide their attention. Due to the digital nature of this hack, it can also be updated instantaneously when connected to a network, hence providing real-time feedbacks such as a change of route or traffic. Furthermore, augmented reality can highlight pedestrians and bikers so that they are more noticeable to drivers, hence decreasing the likelihood of a car accident.
