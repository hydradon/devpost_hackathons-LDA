                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not come up with a practical solution to anything so we went for a game instead
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Searches a keyword in the Twitter API, user guesses how many tweets the word appears in or four tweets are listed and the user guesses which has the most retweets or favorites
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is done with a twitter api query to return some tweets(100) from there we count the instances of a word or take the four most retweeted or favorited and then display the question.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitter API took a bit to figure out. Every member was learning to do something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we got a useable product by the end with the lags we as a team trying to learn the languages and APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one group member knew asp. No group member knew APIs. Certainly learned to try out all possible APIs before the competition.
