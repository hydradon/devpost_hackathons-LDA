                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been excited about the concept of indirect encodings applied to natural systems. Specifically we found a formal grammer called the L-System that can encode some very emergent natural properties of self similiarity and fractal structure. We thought s(ASP) would be the perfect language to generate instances of this system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates formal grammar sequences that can be interpreted however we chose (and chose to represent biological trees visually in Python). Once sequences are generated we can efficiently discover sub-sequences based on an inverse L-system algorithm. This function could be useful for finding gene sequences in large genome sets, which coincidentally are a great universe to be modelled by L-Systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is implemented in s(ASP).  We created rules to travese up and down the L-System tree one level at a time.  We then recusively called the travse down method in order to check if a given system can be reduced to a given seed.  Using the travese up method we recursively made a function to generate all the possible tree level given a seed.  After generating large trees we passed those tree level's into python to create a visualization of the tree.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found out quickly that using any recursive algorithm quickly increases the processing time exponentially .Getting to run the program in a reasonable amount of time and memory was challenging because of the algorithm time complexity and stack space limitation we had to deal with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We solved the time complexity issue by making the algorithm left recursive and re-wrote a lot of fundamental algorithm to fit our case.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recursive languages may increase simplicity, but if implemented poorly will fill up the stack unnecessarily.  To avoid events like this tail recusion is a must and every recursive call and recursive method must be carefully thought and the implementation considered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for L-Gen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to integrate L-Gen into gene-sequencing for neuro-evolution.  s(ASP) will allow us to harness the speed and flexibilty simply.  L-Gen has great potential into the realm of data compression, if rules could be made to reduce the length of a binary string and then used again to obatain the orginal string.
