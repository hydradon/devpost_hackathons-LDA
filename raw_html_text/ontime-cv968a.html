                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Life has seen a major change with the turn of the 21st century. Students and young professionals are finding themselves much busier with the same amount of time to complete their tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app takes inputs from the user to quickly create a hierarchy of their daily duties based on a given task's priority, and it's corresponding due date. This drastically reduces the time required to plan out one's weekly schedule, allowing people to accomplish more day to day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began by thinking about the different variables a person considers when planning out their schedule. Once we established our variables we designed a function to create a 'TrueImportance' variable. This is the variable that allows us to best sort and prioritize the different items in someone's schedule. Having this done automatically by our program saves time by automatically planning out the best schedule for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew we wanted to have it run on a mobile device, which meant coding in either Java for Android or Swift for iOS. After attempting to code our initial list in Swift, and failing miserably, we decided we would play to our strengths (Java and Python) and code in a language that we were familiar with. The coding in Java went much smoother, and we were able to code our entire ToDoList, with the 'TrueImportance' variable in the same amount of time it took us to make almost no progress in Swift.
                </p>
                <p>
                    None of us knew any XML, the front-end language for Android so learning and implementing through copious Google Searches was a struggle. Luckily, after much of our own troubleshooting and help of some mentors, we were able to resolve all the issues with our XML code develop our applications user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technologically, we are proud of our 'TrueImportance' variable. Creating this variable allows our application to intelligently arrange your schedule and takes the hassle out of arranging your own schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a non-technological side, our team's ability to solve problems fast and distribute tasks effectively was unmatched. We each came in with our different skill sets and we each implemented them so that we used our 24-hours most effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about XML code and integration as well as real-world Java applications. Further, we learned how to best organize our time to be productive, scheduling effective breaks, and approaching all problems from an opposite problem-solving strategy. This strategy which we learned at the MariHacks Ideation workshop allowed us to come up with solutions outside of the box.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OnTime
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next development for OnTime is integrating our ToDoList into a monthly calendar, as well as developing APIs for university student course software such as McGill's MyCourses and Concordia's MyConcordia. In addition, we will be looking for improvements and clarifications in our current ToDoList code.
