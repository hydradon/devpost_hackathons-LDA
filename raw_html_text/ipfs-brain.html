                    Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) allows you to submit a file to the network and it be split across many different nodes. You can then later request this file back from the network with just its hash as reference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be an interesting idea to implement this in a way where instead of files being stored across computer nodes, they&rsquo;re stored by human nodes!

                    When you give a file, it&rsquo;s encrypted and converted to a series of mnemonic words. These are then split into shorter batches of words and sent to people to be remembered. At a later point you can request the words from these people!
