                    Globally cars, trucks, and other vehicles make up 15% of all carbon emissions. This is a big percentage, and we think that it is important to try and help cut down on this percentage. This is why we made FootPrint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FootPrint uses the google maps api, and finds the carbon foot print of the route by car by using the miles per gallon the car gets, and how far away the two locations are. The app will suggest more environmentally friendly alternatives, like walking or biking. It will also tell you how many calories you will burn with the alternative modes of transportation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built the backend of FootPrint using node.js, and express. We hosted the backend on google app engine. We built the front end mainly with html and javascript. The backend uses get requests to parse the frontend's url for values calculated using google's api. These numbers are the distance in miles driving, biking, and walking. The backend uses these numbers to calculate things like the calories burned, or how many carbon emissions are made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making FootPrint was a challenge, because we did not have a lot of experience with the google maps api, or the google distance matrix api. Google documented things very well, but it was still a bit of a learning curve getting everything implemented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were proud of using node.js and express to make get requests, to get values from the html website. We were also proud of implementing some of google's api's.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Node.js was a big thing that we learned over the course of the Hackathon. We didn't only learn technical skills though, we also learned to keep our patience, and eventually we'll figure something out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next for FootPrint would be a login and reward system. We would reward the user with points when they choose to take a more environmentally healthy mode of transportation. We would use a login system to keep track of these points. We would also like to keep track of what car the user has.
