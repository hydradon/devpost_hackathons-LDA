                    -The internal Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) transmitter within the Arduino 101 was used in order to transmit data from an air quality sensor, a light sensor, and a temperature sensor in byte format to a server. A series of these devices were then simulated and their measurements were aggregated in order to gain an average measurement of temperature of the surrounding area. The temperature was also monitored and an alarm was set to trigger in case of temperatures that would be dangerous to the health of the user. In future, a mesh of these devices could be used in order to gain accurate weather data for a precise area and find areas that may be submerged or leaking gas in a disaster situation.

                    -A mongo DB server containing our webapp is stored on the google cloud platform. Our database is also stored on this server, and contains Admin user accounts, which are capable of giving and removing access to other users via the webapp. The webapp displays the information from the various sensors on the gauntlet as well as completes any requests given by unique RFID tags, whether it be unlocking a door, accessing certain content, or obtaining sensor information.They also function as a potable means of identification in a disaster setting

                    </strong>
                    -The server connects directly to the safety gauntlet arduino set using Bluetooth Low Energy Protocol. Using a python module called PyBluez, binary data can be sent byte-by-byte from the arduino into a python script. This data can then be interpretted as chars by python and converted into usful integers within a specific range.  Then, the script can then communicate the data in its meaningful form to the Flask server via a named pipe. Using a pipe ensures that all reads and writes are happening when they need to and that data does not idley aggregate while the server is not listening. Users can see this data from the server via an AJAX call that has the server read the named pipe and return a JSON of the data, which is then neatly formatted for the user within javascript.
