                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Used Smart Contract on Solidity to check the business logic that measures the amount of Ethers allowed nation. Deployed smart contract onto Quorum and used Azure as our cloud platform to deploy Quorum nodes onto it.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating Web3Js with Truffle was more time consuming than anticipated. The format of real time data available to measure AQI(Air Quality Index). Currently, we are able to receive it for all states in a country and compute accordingly. But, we were not able to get the data nation wise.

                <p>
                    Extend it to use hourly real time data to measure AQI more accurately and fairly. Continue researching on the fairness model of distribution of tokens. Extend the model to monitor water pollution as well. Research on finance distribution and impact in the long run
