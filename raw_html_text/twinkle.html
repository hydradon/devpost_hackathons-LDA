                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being avid social media users, we have noticed the sudden and growing popularity in astrology and how users have daily horoscope mobile applications to explain their horoscopes and sign to them. We have also noticed the continuous growth of online dating and the number of platforms that are available for a person to find their significant others online. As we joking around about each others' horoscope and how we were destined to find our true love, we came up with the idea to combine astrology and dating.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twinkle helps users find others who are compatible with them through astrology. Just like similar dating platforms, a user is presented with a pool of people who are compatible with the users based on their Sun, Moon, and/or Rising signs. Users can also read their daily horoscopes as well as understand their individual signs.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we wanted to create a mobile application, we have decided to create an iOS application using xcode and Swift. For our database, we utilized Firebase to store all our schemas and information from our users. We also used the Astrology API and Google Maps Platform to extract with the end goal of transforming our data to accurately provide matches and horoscopes to users.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into multiple challenges throughout our development process. Our biggest challenges were understanding how to utilize the Firebase system into our application to correctly store data, finding the correct astrology API, and making API calls through Swift.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we ran into many road bumps during this project, it has definitely challenged us to persevere and work around our issues. Our biggest accomplishments were being able to incorporate Firebase into Twinkle and make successful API calls.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned how to collaborate with each other during the development stage and have learned how to use different software and resources to carry out different aspects of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Twinkle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving forward, we would like to implement the feature for users to scan through their matches and create an in-app messaging feature to allow more user interactivity. In addition, we would redesign our UI by creating a more intuitive and minimalistic interface to better the user experience.
