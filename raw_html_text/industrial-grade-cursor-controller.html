                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Memes. No, seriously.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a smart mouse - it moves the cursor and clicks, BUT it also copies and pastes between devices
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put an arduino in a box and put a bunch of wires in that box and put some buttons on that box.
We also wrote a driver
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we were going to use an actual mouse, and have the arduino act as a buffer between that and the computer,
but we decided to go a different direction after frustration. We also had a lot of trouble implementing the copying and pasting
                </p>

                    It works

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot - how to program an arduino, a bit about electronics
