                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since hacking has become more common, we wanted to create a messaging environment where both users feel secure about the messages that they send.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app generates a pub key, which is sent to the recipient. The user then types in his message and sends it to the recipient, who uses the pub key to decrypt the message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to parse the public key from the RSA public key generator, we had to use a Base64 encoder. This function only works on phones running Android 8.0, so we can only test our app on emulators running Android 8.0.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having our app work.
                </p>

                    What's next for RSAEncryptor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly having our app send encrypted emails.
Making it more compatible with older Android devices.
