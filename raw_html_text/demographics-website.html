                    The website will display graphs of suicide data. The website was built with HTML, the graphs were made in Jupyter. I have not been able to make the graphs have straight lines, as they go to the x-axis after every data point. I learned how to do data analysis with pandas, read data from an excel files, create graphs using Jupyter, and how to make a basic web page in HTML. I am proud of completing all of this, as before this I had no prior knowledge of HTML and basic knowledge of Python data analysis. I learned many useful skills for data analysis and will continue to use these skills to analyze larger data sets in the future and possibly create a neural network in the next year. I will work on improving the website in my free time and working with Jupyter to get a better grasp on it for next years hackathon.
