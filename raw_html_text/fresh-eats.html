                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few months ago, my partner and I realized that we could change the way we fundamentally ate food; the best dish we had ever eaten didn't come from a restaurant or a Walmart, but it came from one of our family members.  Foods and meals from our neighbors and our community are not only healthier and more organic, but they taste better as well.  We wanted to build a platform that could change the way we discovered foods and delicacies and bring the community closer together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fresh Eats provides a mobile marketplace for users to easily discover nearby healthy and homemade food options.  Users that love to cook can share their traditional family recipes to the world while making extra cash on the side.  Cooks can easily manage the distribution of their foods to their buyers, and buyers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ionic and Cordova to build Fresh Eats as a cross platform technology.  Additionally, Stripe technology was used to facilitate online payments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges associated with adopting a cross-platform approach such as Ionic.  Ionic allows us to easily access the entire market with arguable half the work, but performance issues were problematic at times.  Additionally, we realized that peer-to-peer transactions are more difficult than simple checkout.  Lots of regulations make accomplishing this task much more technologically difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were successfully able to engineer a solution within 48 hours that could stand in place for a minimum viable product.  Bringing together a project like that is not easy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Ionic and integration with Firebase.  Through the project, we were able to learn that cross platform technologies served their own challenges.  We also learned a great deal about how we can mesh together the physical world with the online world, and this itself poses its own set of unique hurdles and challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fresh Eats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to finish peer-to-peer transactions and take Fresh Eats to the market.  We believe there is a huge demand in the market for homemade and healthy food and this app provides the solution to this problem.
