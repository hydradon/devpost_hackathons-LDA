                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When my grandpa immigrated to the United States, he ate hot dogs for his entire first week here because he didn't speak English and that was the only word he knew. Later, when he'd go to restaurants, he would just point to other people's food and say "I want that" because he wasn't familiar with what was on the menus. 
For people who don't speak the language or are new to a foreign country, ordering at a restaurant can be a game of chance and a difficult experience. f&uml;&uuml;d is here to change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    f&uuml;d is an iphone app to help restaurant goers figure out what to order. The app allows users to scan an item on a menu, and it instantly displays an image of that particular food item.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built in swift, f&uuml;d uses the tesseract optical character recognition (OCR) API to transform the words on your menu to text. This text is then fed into a custom google search engine which returns an image to show the user.
                </p>
