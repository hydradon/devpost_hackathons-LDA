                    Our platform game centers around the character Octocat, who needs your help in building his credit score. You must navigate E-World to collect coins and direct Octocat towards the correct answers. If you answer all of the questions correctly and collect all of the coins, then you will have a perfect credit score. Good luck!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized GDevelop in order to create our app.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before we started this project, we were unfamiliar with GDevelop and we had to learn how to use it. Being non-computer science majors, making a game at all was daunting.

                <p>
                    We used each of our strengths to complete a fully functional game, which would help students learn about valuable life skills, including credit and debt management.

                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize GDevelop in order to create an app in an efficient manner.

                    Next, we would love to flesh out the game and add more interactive elements.
