                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a note taking application which could reduce the usage of paper and help us go green.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a page to type in words and generate a note with a note title and note body. You can also "save" your note, although we have not developed a way of accessing this saved note later on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using Android Studio, we created layouts and then programmed in java to create the note. We looked up several tutorials to figure out how it functions, and used the Android API to research the different methods that can be used in Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one in our team has ever used Android Studio, and we're all beginners in programming, so we were lost at first. We spent a long trying to understand the Android Studio interface. Along with that, it took us a while to understand how debugging worked, and how we could use the Android emulator to try to debug our programs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finally made something that can actually work, and we leaned a lot from it, even if it is small!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The basic components of android application, and how to use android studio in less than 24 hours. Although we didn't finish our project, this experience is a good start to develop other projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NoteTaker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to create a menu to list out all the notes made, and we want to be able to link the pages together. In addition, we want to create a new feature that will allow you to make a to-do list and check off items you have completed, in addition to creating "Notebooks," which contain different notes for different subjects.
