                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tried to move around blocks with Leap Motion, then I tried to make sand with leap motion, then I realized the sand was kinda like a fluid, then I decided it would do well as blood and changed it from a proof-of-concept into a function game proof-of-concept.
40% Credit to a lack of sleep.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity3D, a Rift, a Leap Motion, a few packages and drivers, then messed around.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Can't. Pick. Up. Blocks.
Also my custom gesture detection can be a little hard to use sometimes.

                <p>
                    I made a fun game... and I also made some semi-functional gestures.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I now know how to use a Rift and Leap Motion with Unity. Yay.

                    Probably nothing. Fighting games aren't really my thing.
