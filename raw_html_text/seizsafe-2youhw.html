                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people across the world suffer from seizures, short bursts in electrical activity causing erratic movements. Despite the large neurotechnology market out there, there seems to be a limited amount of consumer devices that are designed for people suffering with this condition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app keeps track of a person's EEG (electroencephalogram) data. By calibrating a user to its normal brainwave state, the device will alert the user if they notice a change in brainwave activity. If the user does not dismiss this alert, it will be assumed that a seizure had occurred and emergency contacts that were set up will be texted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Muse EEG device as well as the Muse Android developer and the Android Studio to help develop this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the many challenges we ran into was dealing with the compatibility with the Muse device as the Bluetooth and battery life often broke down. Splitting up the task into different devices was also a difficulty when finally assembling the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to successfully generate an app that could connect to the Muse device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the many things we learnt were how to work with Android Studio and how to approach a compilation or runtime error better when solving it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SeizSafe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we wish to also add accelerometers, heart rate monitors, and the Myo armband. We also wish that the Android app will be compatible with iOS devices and other EEG techs.
