                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gazing down upon the disorderly rows of multibranded scooters littering the sidewalk and obstructing all that is good in the city, we realized that these street beasts had not yet reached the limit of their usefulness nor obnoxiousness.  After all, they sit there waiting silently for users.  Silently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a geographically micro-local adaptive radio station.  The app shows users the bands who are currently nearby and playing or soon to play at venues that the user is passing by on the scooter right now, and it can play a clip of their songs.  It needn't be limited to scooters either; pedestrians and motorists can access the app.
                </p>
