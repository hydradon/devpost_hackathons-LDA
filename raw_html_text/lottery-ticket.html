                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allowing players to generate truly random numbers. In the UK almost 46 million people play the lottery each year. Most people prefer to go the lucky dip route where the lottery shop generates the random numbers for them.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill offers an alternative to the standard random numbers offered when buying a lottery ticket. The truly/premium random numbers are statistically drawn from atmospheric noise. The free offering uses the regular pseudo random generator from the python language.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Much of the documentation on implementing in skill purchases is scattered all over the place, in official docs, forums and blogs. I had to read a lot of documentation and finally had a lot of breakthroughs with the github examples.

                    Piecing together this skill has been a challenge but finally managed to make it run.

                    What I learned

                    A bit more python and a lot of Alexa SDK.

                    Not sure. First let's see if it has any traction.
