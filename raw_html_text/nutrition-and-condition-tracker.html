                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a person who enjoys working out I felt that I had an idea of where to go with a program based around advising your workouts and diet. However, the most influential factor was the fact that we were also limited from doing the other two challenge topics since we simply don't know enough about coding and web design yet to make a program to complete the other challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It intends to use a user interface to get information from the user and then use this information to help them with a daily goal counter, a diet and exercise adviser, and a specially catered nutrition plan based off of algorithms relating to your age, sex, and weight. It only takes the information, writes it to a file, brings up a portion of a user interface. We were unable to get it to load the file and thus we didn't include the portion of the program that just shares the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split into three portions of the code. I was making the user interface and I was going to then use code made by Van and Kate to combine the interface and the background processes to calculate the dieting and read and write to the files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was some trouble making our user interface function properly. Some buttons and text boxes would scale improperly even with code specifically designating different sizes. We didn't understand why this occurred, but we found some jerry-rigged ways around it. We also had trouble with both the user interface and the algorithms when trying to read the files. We are freshman that are very early into our computer science careers with little experience, we attempted to fix the problems in the allotted time, but we just weren't able to in our time frame and with our inexperience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We eventually figured out a much better way to make the user interface which will eventually come in handy again. We also got experience writing to files, which will also definitely come in handy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal about writing to files and making user interfaces. We also learned that we need to greatly improve our group work setup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Nutrition and Condition Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aren't quite sure. We likely won't do anymore with it since it isn't built in a way for practical use - it's only to complete the challenge. However, we will likely come back to this code to see how we can improve and see what we did right.
