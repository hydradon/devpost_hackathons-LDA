                    Actors have lines. Some actors have a lot of lines. Lines are hard to memorize; it takes a lot of time and requires a lot of line iteration in order to properly recall what you're supposed to say and when you're supposed to say it. Reading through your script to find your cue line can work, but you're also prone to allowing your peripheral vision to accidentally read your own line as well. "I knew that," you tell yourself, but you definitely did not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For years, actors have been solving this problem by making friends and coercing them to help them study lines in their free time. Friends will read your cue aloud, and then read your line to check to make sure you're right. Since you never see the script, you can't accidentally read your line and foul up your practice session.

                <p>
                    Now, with Line Runner, actors don't need friends!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    tl;dr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Line Runner can run lines with any character in any scene, so long as it has a script file to reference. Simply tell it who you want to be; Line Runner will read aloud your cue line and wait for you to say your line. If you're wrong, Line Runner will chastise you as much or more than your friend would. If you're right, Line Runner will skip forward to your next cue.

                <h2>
                    God Mode
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For an added challenge, try "God Mode!" Three wrong lines in a row and the program will
                    <code>
                        rm -rf /
                    </code>
                    ; this should encourage you to remember your lines.
