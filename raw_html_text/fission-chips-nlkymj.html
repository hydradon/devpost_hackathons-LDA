                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're beginners, we all love physics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not very much, but one physics calculation (we still have to integrate several others)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Consulted online resources and workshops for learning html, css and javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were learning all the languages we used and were unfamiliar with everything. It was an educational 24hrs!  Also CSS formatting is not our friend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we have something to submit.  We are really proud of the idea we came up with because it has a practical application in our lives.  We are also glad that we know it works for one equation, and we know how to integrate several other equations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of things.  The first thing we learned was the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  We also learned to interface and get input from a user, and then use those variables to generate an output.

                    More Hackathons! Finishing our Physics Calculator and giving it to all our friends.
