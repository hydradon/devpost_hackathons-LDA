                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While visiting new cities, everyone uses Uber. However, it can be scary waiting for your Uber at an unknown location, especially in a sketchy city. Instead of standing in one spot, most likely looking down at your phone, why not be on the move to a safer location?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using 10 years of Philly's crime data, UberSafe sets your pick-up location to the closest area with low crime rates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the City of Philadelphia's CSV file of crime inputs, we extracted the latitude and longitude of crime spots and added them to the file. Using this information and a mock Uber app created using the Uber API, we wanted to make sure a pick-up location isn't near the hub of one of these spots and if it is, change the location to a walkable distance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one had any experience with iOS or Android development so while we attempted to use both, decided in the end to just make a mock web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use of APIs and working with real data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UberSafe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We also know that the worst part of Ubering is the pickup. With more data on how busy a street is, if it's a one-way, wide enough for someone to pull over, we would like to optimize the pick-up location to not only be safe, but less rushed.
