                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm an Imgur user, and as part of the culture there, you don't just comment, you use a gif to react. Show your feelings. Here, what my app is trying to do is be a great resource for new Imgur users and old to find new and exciting gifs to use as their reactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a set of 7 buttons. 5 introductory categories: Happy, Sad, Angry, Shocked and Facepalm. These are attached to buttons on the site, and when pressed, choose a random gif from the list to display. The other two buttons activate two other modes, Cat mode, and Dog mode, which disables the categories of the other buttons, and enables cat/dog only gifs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Giphy's api to build the site. It's not very pretty, but I think it's cool.

                <p>
                    More categories, new ways to interact with the gifs, maybe user submissions?
