                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As engineering students, we often apply for internships as early as freshman year hoping for a shot to work at one of the Big 4. In doing so, we submit countless number of applications to various companies yet we can lose track of them easily. This is where intern.demand comes in.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps students track job applications and where they are at in the interview process. Students can also leave notes on the interview saying what they have learned from a particular interview to keep it in mind for the future. There are also two boxes to mark whether or not the student has gotten an offer or was rejected. The search bar allows for easy search by matching the query string to existing job titles.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Full Stack was mainly coded in JavaScript. We used React for the front end and Node.js for the back end. We also used a mix of libraries such as axios and express.js in order to help implement our design. We used Firebase for the database and Google Cloud Platform to host our server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starting out was very rough for us because half of the team is mostly new to the React syntax and JavaScript in general. However, it got slightly easier as time progressed and it was easier to get used to syntax and how properties and states were managed. Futhermore, CSS proved to be a huge hurdle as well as focusing on which problems to tackle first. We had so many ideas to implement but limited time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of being able to work with my team and build a starting concept in my first hackathon. Even though it was difficult to get the front end software communicating with the back end and took overnight, the effort was worth it. I think there is a lot to learn and a lot of knowledge gained from this experience. A lot of the problems I faced during the hackathon were easily solved by mapping elements in an array to React components. It reduced repeating code and still created the same effect we had wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about time management and team communication. Hackathons can get very hectic and time is of the essence in order to build the first steps in a product useful for many students. My team and I had valuable experience in solving some problems we came across and will be applying this knowledge in the future.

                    What's next for intern.demand
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looking down the road, we had several features we wanted to implement. We were considering a payment system where users can pay $5 per month to see premium tips about a job based on others who have gotten interviews. The more highly rated reviews a user leaves, the more reviews the user can see. We are also planning to clean up the UI to make it more interactable and appear more aesthetic.
