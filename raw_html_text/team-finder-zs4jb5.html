                    The inspiration of this project was pickup basketball. We believe that outdoor and team activities can be fun for everyone when playing with  team. We created Team-Finder in order to bring people together who otherwise would be complete strangers. Not only does Team-Finder search for people nearby, it also takes into account their interests, skill level and past interactions with other users. We implemented a vector space search engine for managing users' geographical distance and personal interests / preferences. Throughout the course of the 24-hours, we learned a lot about android user interfaces, NoSQL, vectors, and the concepts of functional programming. For example, Raj discovered that coding a user interface is not as easy as it looks. Kunal, working on the backend, learned the importance of time management and organization. These skills were essential to finishing his first hackathon. While we were unable to implement an Android UI, we partially substituted it with website as our front end.

                    In the future, we hope to integrate our code with mobile platforms and also optimize our backend algorithms. We also want to look into security and safety for our users.
