                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bootstrap is easy enough, but what about people who want to make simple websites with zero HTML experience but all of the advantages of a Bootstrap template?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a Python program that converts content from a text file into a Bootstrap website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This uses a Python program to write pieces of the "Freelancer" Bootstrap template index.html with new content retrieved from a text in it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was written almost entirely during another hackathon that took place this week during which I also made another project. Also, Python handles strings and file reading and writing in an interesting way sometimes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I almost finished this on time. The text required format is pretty logical and easy-to-use for a human reader.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't do two projects at one hackathon and expect to finish both. Run your program and check for errors often. I also learned how to read and write files in Python and I improved my HTML skills a little bit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bootstrap but Even Easier
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Share it online with people who would have a use for it. Allow different types of sections and more images and colors if people want them.
