                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GVSU's wellness initiative inspired me to create something that will help students to relax and remember that they are a part of a much larger planet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It displays a live feed of the earth from the International Space Station, broadcast from NASA's website. It also provides students with a form of feedback to suggest new live feed videos to embed. This promotes a positive mindset for students, which may be especially important if they are about to view test grades.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I embedded the code supplied by NASA right into the Blackboard module. I also used basic HTML elements to make a link to NASA's site and a suggestion form.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a live stream that could be embedded into a website easily was challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking very simple HTML elements and creating a simple live stream that could have many uses depending on the videos used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that certain videos that are available can quickly and easily be embedded into a website.
                </p>

                    What's next for ISS Live Stream
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using the user comments, ISS Live Stream has the potential to display different, more desirable videos to promote wellness.
