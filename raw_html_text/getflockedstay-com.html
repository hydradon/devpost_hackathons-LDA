                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well we had a Twitter API that we really wanted to base our project around, and something about Capital One's API stood out to us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connects consumer twitter accounts and banking accounts to detect potential fraud transactions occurring on the users bank account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Nessi API provides us with Customer Names and Banking Accounts, and from there we added to the API producing a fake phone number, twitter account, and status of the account. Based on that we check the location of their most recent tweet and then compare it to the location of the transaction. If the two don't correspond within a parameter of time and distance, using Twilio's API a text is sent to the bank account owner alerting them of the transaction at which they can reply yes and continue with their banking experience or click no and have their bank account frozen and fraud department alerted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well the Nessi API didn't provide much information so we had to create our own purchases, transactions and other consumer information. Along with the connection of all the different ends of the projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the entire project, the team members were great and it was a fun time for everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use .json file. We learned to work as a team better, how to incorporate everyone's ideas without having anyone felt under appreciated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for getflocked
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporate other social media/factors to determine potential fraud. To pivot towards a mobile app versus text notifications, due to the fact that most fraud occurs over seas and thus consumers might not always have cellular service.
