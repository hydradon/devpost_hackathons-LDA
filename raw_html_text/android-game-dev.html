                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use Unity's powerful Game Development software to develop a 2D game, similar to Geometry Dash. At that time, none of the team members knew how to run it, and there was no easy way to learn it. It was because of this problem in trying to understand Unity that led us to make the game educational. We wanted to save those in the future the pain of having to spend hours on end just troubleshooting.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project uses a combination of an Android app and an HTML page. The android app is used to demonstrate the original example with the aspiring coder can look off of, while the HTML page is a guide to the process that we used. The application comes with three levels for some semblance of variety, and the HTML page explains each level and the process and the resultant issues.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to develop the game, and we used MS Paint to develop the sprites. Our Companion app was made with Android Studio, and the scripts were made with C#. A basic HTML page was made for the purpose of displaying the game, and descriptions were added beneath the embedded file.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of problems just trying to figure out where and where not to code for Unity. Most of our time was spent troubleshooting small problems that threw out whole game for a loop.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While there are still many things that this project lacks, we managed to accomplish some truly difficult things. One of our proudest moments was when we learned how to code triggers from scratch, without any outside help. In fact, we made most of the project without using the built-in packages from Unity. The collision-checker, mouse-control, and the assets were all made from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, we learned a great many things about the different systems we used. Coming in as beginners, we had little to no prior experience in any sort of hacking, let alone a 24-hour hackathon. Everything we did today - from coding in HTML and C# to using Android Visual Studio - was learned within the period of time we were given to code a fully-functional application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GeoDash
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As most people tend to notice, our interface is very robust. Ideally, given more time, the sprites could be replaced with more realistic characters, backgrounds, and just better graphics in general.
