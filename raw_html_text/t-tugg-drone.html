                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from two pilots who&rsquo;ve made many mistakes when moving about on the ground at airports that have also realized that attempting to move about when completing checklist can become difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    T-Tugg-Drone is an optional unmanned aerial system that will allow safer, more efficient, streamlined operations by guiding airplanes around the airport property.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used many parts from the supplies lab to build our drone from the ground up; such as motors, boards, harnesses,etc. The frame is a 100% recycled quadcopter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into were making our drone do some of its main tasks when having parts that were not compatible with one another. Another huge problem was not being able to 3D print any of our materials due to the time it would take to print.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our main accomplishment are to getting our drone to actually fly and getting its camera system up and running.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that when something fails it only makes us stronger to keep pushing forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for T- Tugg -Drone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing T-Tugg-Drone is looking into is to allow for its Drones to become even more capable and allow for even more integration.
