The analysis will help the doctor better diagnose their patients The attributes that doctors would like to monitor can be &ldquo;customerized&rdquo; based on their requirements and body vital functions with the help of different and sensors. Attributes include: pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rates, oxygen saturation, blood flow, ETC02 (carbon dioxide), body temperature, image, accelerometer, heart rate variability.
