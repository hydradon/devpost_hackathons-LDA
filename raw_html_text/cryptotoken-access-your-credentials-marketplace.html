                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We identified a number of cases where users may wish to buy or sell access credentials to third-party services, but require a method of exchange via decentralized services.  Examples vary, but could include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            A gamer who has invested spare time into developing a game character of a high level that would like to exchange it for financial gain
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            A citizen of a country with a history of extreme internet censorship who blocks access to VPN sign-up sites and requires purchasing VPN URL/username/password credentials
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            A gift recipient who has received a prepaid card/account for a popular video streaming service like Netflix who wishes to sell it for ETH
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows credentials to real world services to be transferred in a decentralized and trust-less manner through an Ethereum based dApp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a combination of tools for frontend (Svelte, a user interface tool similar to Vue.js) and backend (Express.js) along with web3.js for interacting with Ethereum's Ropsten testnet.  Using a leading browser and Metamask a user is able to interact with the dApp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially thought we could use NuCypher to faciliate encrypting and decrypting access credentials which could be stored on the public Ethereum chain.  However, after working to understand the different components and attempting to run demos on localhosts and then AWS we were unable to fit our use case within the context of how NuCypher was designed.  We communicated with multiple members of the NuCypher team over the EthBoston discord and appreciated their help and guidance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Afterward, we attempted to see if SKALE was a fit for storage of encrypted credentials.  Unfortunately, we quickly ran into an issue with using the SKALE testnet created for EthBoston participants as the testnet ETH faucet wasn't working.  After communicating with a couple members of the SKALE team they worked on resetting the testnet node, but due to timing we had to abandon any more experimentation with SKALE and pursue a different solution.  We appreciate the help and assistance offered by the SKALE team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we arrived at EthBoston we didn't know what we wanted to do and had never worked together as a team.  After an ideation session Friday evening we were able to come up with some options we thought promising, and then by early Saturday morning we were able to unite behind this single idea as a unified team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We experimented with multiple new projects/technologies including NuCypher, SKALE, and Nightfall.  While we ended up using none of these in this project, it was a worthwhile learning experience and many team members are excited to carry on research and experimentation with this technologies in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A number of sponsors have toolchains that are still deep in development and require more time than expected to use within a dApp.  We probably spent more time than we needed trying to integrate with these tools, but it was a valuable learning experience to experiment with these different tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After casually talking about our project with some other hackathon attendees we learned there could definitely be interest in a production launch of a project like ours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The members of our team all had differing experience levels with Ethereum development and it was a great experience creating an actual, working dApp together.
                </p>
