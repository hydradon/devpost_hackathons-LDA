                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combine various environments to control a rover via webpage and see video feedback via ip camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The raspberry pi hosts a webserver that serves a webpage with buttons that can be used to control the rover. The arrow keys can also be used on the web page. The phone on the rover streams video data through an ip camera which gets read by a python script that can be used to identify objects as people, tables, chairs, and more.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Raspberry Pi, Rover, H-bridges, phone, and more.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Busecure did not allow us to connect to the raspberry pi, so we had to make a hotspot out of our computers and phones to connect to the raspberry pi while having an internet connection. We also had to learn enough javascript and web programming to get what we needed.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got it to work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jquery needs an internet connection... lost too much time trying to figure that out...
