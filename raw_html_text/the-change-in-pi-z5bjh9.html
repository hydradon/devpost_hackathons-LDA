                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members was flying to Arizona and was running a little late at the airport. He got into the security checkpoint line and was anxious due to how long the line was and he didn't know if he would get through in time. He thought to himself that there's got to be a better way where he would know how much time he actually has and if he should be taking action to try and get through the line faster. Thus, Line Sign was born!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Counts the number of WiFi enabled devices in a defined region. This data is recorded passively via a monitoring USB interface to capture cell phone probe requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Raspberry Pi Model 2 B has been imaged with a Rasbian Linux distribution. A USB network interface card has been set to intercept mobile probe requests that contain unique MAC address information. The information was displayed via a responsive mobile user interface with an interactive map region, real time logging, and waiting times via the Raspberry Pi. Also, we implemented an intercom system via building a LM386 Amplifier circuit with 20 gain that would announce waiting times.
