                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with basic web development knowledge so I started just making the design. I soon realized how much logic would be involved in the project so I almost quit but instead decided to watch videos on jQuery and PHP. We then decided to build the front-end with the Google Places API, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap and then began programming the server-side with SQL and PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into many problems bridging the API and working with it but after hours of struggling we figured out our issue. The most trouble we had was communicating variables between HTML, Javascript, and PHP at around 4:00am. Finally, we ran into trouble deploying it from the laptop to the web. It all worked out however.
