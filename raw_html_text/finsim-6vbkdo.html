                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for the simulation comes from our own experiences in not understanding what kinds of financial decisions that adults need to make. We want the future youth to be well prepared for their lives outside of their parents house and their care.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The simulation assigns the player a random salary and scenario at the beginning of the simulation.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Java
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many programming challenges when we were coding the project. We managed to fix all of them, however we spent a lot of time on them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the project we made because we were rusty on coding and we were able to make a decent prototype of what we wanted to accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there's always going to be unexpected challenges in coding that slow you down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FinSim
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can finish the simulation and add on the rest of the ideas we had for the project.
