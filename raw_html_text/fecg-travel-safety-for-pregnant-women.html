                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are developing a project to continuously monitoring the health of our expected baby. Moumita having to spend significant amount of time in traffic is always worried about the baby's health. We feel this is no different for any other parents. Even though there are several Doppler based heart beat listening devices available, they are not meant for continues monitoring and it's proved medically that FECG's are more accurate than doppler devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, traditional FECG devices adopts minimum 3 leads: Two Thorax leads ( Lead 1 and Lead2) and one abdomain lead. Generally so many leads can not be used for continues monitoring as such devices are bulky and needs medical assistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Especially during starting few weeks of the pregnancy, chances of miscarriage is high in travel. Even after, women suffers from fatigue and many other symptoms. They are often worried about the baby's health irrespective of the mode of travel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This wearable light weight device and our revolutionary back end cloud based Fetus heart rate extraction algorithm allows women to be always under monitoring and get alerted when they need a break from travel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It monitors both maternal and the fetus health through a single lead abdominal ECG system and back end cloud based monitoring system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built on our revolutionary single lead ECG diagonestic system called Hrydyalysis. We had to design the hardware and connectivity to make it safer for the mother by eliminating battery and other circuit units as away from the body as possible.
