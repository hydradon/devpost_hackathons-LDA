                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never done a graphical program in python and the game of life is a classic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The grid of cells follow a few simple rules to generate impressively complex behavior. Too few or too many neighbors and a cell will die, but with just the right number (3) another cell is born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python using pygame library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incompatibility issues with python 3.5 vs 2.7.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The colors are randomized at startup, resulting in many different colored groups of cells. From there, the child cells adopt the color of their parents. This results in an interesting transition from many colors to a muted average color.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Good refresher on Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PyGame of Life
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were also considering adding music visualization using the game of life as well. This could be added without too much difficulty.
