                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one likes waiting in line for things, especially for medically related issues. For many, walk-ins have a tremendously long wait time and for some, calling can seem daunting. That is why we created Schedule Cloud. With Schedule Cloud, a client is able to see a doctor's available schedule live, and book an appointment. The doctor is able to see all their bookings and also update the schedule if prior appointments are being delayed or finish faster, thus increasing efficiency for both parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As well as allowing both parties to be productive, it also allows a company to save money on administrative support (e.g. a receptionist) and thereby be more productive and allocate money to products or services that matter more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, this application works for ANY relationship, not just client-doctor. This can extend to employees-manager, students-professors/TAs, learners-driving instructors, and many more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One can sign up as the receiver (doctor) or a client. A unique code is provided to the receiver and clients will use that unique code to be linked to the receiver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, the receiver can easily block out the times that they are unavailable. A client will instantly be able to see the update in realtime and if wanted, they can book their own appointment time in a vacant slot simply by tapping on a slot. After that, the receiver will see that the time slot is booked and who it is booked by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also an option for DELAY, where if an event will take longer than required, it shows up on the connected schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend of Schedule Cloud was created using NodeJS. The front end was build in Android Studio using Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't able to use FireBase, because the user authentication system didn't allow for tags on authorized users. Since we needed to differentiate between patients and doctors, we were forced to give up FireBase and use a different server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to complete a skeleton for the program on time. Just being able to deliver a usable interface was a huge accomplishment for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Schedule_Cloud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A more pleasing and aesthetic user interface, option for client/receiver to add/delete notes for an appointment and have it visible to each other, and numerous parties.
