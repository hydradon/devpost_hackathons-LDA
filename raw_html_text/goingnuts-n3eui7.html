                    We wanted to create a simple game that would be able to keep us entertained during passing time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The player is a squirrel who is guarding their acorn stash from birds.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We used the tutorial on Swift, and replaced factors with our own game factors, and added some elements to the game.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Originally, we wanted something much fancier, with levels and upgrades. We couldn't do that, being beginners. So we had to simplify our game idea to a point where we could actually program it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Actually finishing the game, and seeing it functioning like we expected it to.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Programming a game is much harder than we expected, and we also learned the basics to program with Swift.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Upgrading the game, and making it run more smoothly, with new features.
