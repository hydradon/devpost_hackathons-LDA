                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apple's announcement of ARKit brought a lot of attention to iOS developers who now suddenly have the power of AR right  in the palm of their hands without any new equipment. We wanted to use the ARKit technology to create an app, and here we are...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GraffitAR is an ARKit app that allows the users to draw and create graffiti through AR and share it with other GraffitAR users. Each graffiti model can be downloaded by other users and viewed right from their devices, projected onto the real world through the power of AR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Apple's ARKit, that is available for iOS 11 using Xcode 9, to create the application. We also used Firebase to sync all the user data through and allow us to create a "Gallery" that allows you to see what other users have published.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having no prior experience in Augmented Reality, it was
                    <em>
                        interesting
                    </em>
                    to get started.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a beautifully designed UI that is intuitive to use, and easy to create graffiti with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AR is difficult and also fun at the same time.
                </p>

                    What's next for GraffitAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expand the art feature in GraffitAR to enable more style choices.
