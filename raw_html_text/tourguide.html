                    Product Overview
Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach has a number of services, events, buildings and valuable history associated with those buildings and it is often difficult for any student, their parent or a guest to navigate to where they would like to go. Thus, the following system is designed to assist new campus visitors and also ongoing students with guided assistance in an augmented way.
The Augmented Reality Tour Guide (ARTG)&nbsp;system has two perspectives. There is an app component that will allow the students, visitors and administrators an augmented way to navigate the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU)&nbsp;campus in Daytona Beach, Florida. It will provide users a directory of buildings and their history, services and events. A user of the app is enabled to be tour-guided by augmented reality and maps to help them reach their destination. The second component to this system is the administrative perspective. There will be an administrative website that may be used to add/update the information that the app displays from a database on a cloud server fueling the system on the backend.
&nbsp;
Applicability
While this system is designed for usage at ERAU, numerous other scenarios also exist. For example, other schools might also want to use the technology to ensure their visitors and students have easily accessible tools to better understand and navigate their university. Additionally, this app could be relatively simple to adapt for the usage at&nbsp;a state park where personnel may be scarce. This could be due to budget concerns. Ultimately, it is a tech-savy way to cater to the ever-increasing technology consumers who enjoy mobile apps and virtual reality. As previously stated in the product overview, there shall be an administration portal to service the mobile app being used by users. Intrinsically to the design, slight code modifications will be needed to produce buildings or other points of interest, which would then be used by the app.
