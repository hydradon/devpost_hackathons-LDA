                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was inspired by our mutual interest in music and our desires to listen to music more efficiently and try out new emerging technologies safely. As a group, we have the utmost respect for the power of music, but we also realize that it should not distract us from our daily tasks. Music should have its time and place, and when it is played in the background of other tasks, the process of changing the music, or pausing and starting, should not be disruptive.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knock provide a seamless experience for music listeners to gain increased control over song navigation by pausing, playing, and skipping music by knocking on a surface

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Knock was built through Android studio by utilizing both Java, HTML, and various Android APIs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team occasionally had some hardware issues when it came to receiving the desired output from the accelerometer, and determining proper syntax was also sometimes difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create a successful app, considering that this was our first Hackathon and we had a great experience and met lots of new people.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned what it was like to learn from a variety of other very talented coders and improve my own software engineering schools along the way through practice.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Knock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for Knock is to implement the software into music apps such as Spotify or Pandora to increase customer convenience and to also support iOS in the near future.
