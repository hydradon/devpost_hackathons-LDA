                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hack was born out of our desire for using such a product. We are all avid nomads, and this just saves us a lot of money and brainpower when figuring out where to go to.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scrapes the SkyscannerAPI for Flights and Hotels ANYHWERE from your home city. It then automatically suggests the cheapest flights+hotel packages and presents the suggestions right into your Google Calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django to glue the Skyscanner and Google Calendar API together with our own hacker-magic. Used Python for scraping and parsing the JSON datasets, and the standard CSS,JS,jQuery for making a beautiful landing page and front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Merge conflicts, API JSON KeyErrors, API Quota Limits... just the usual.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How seamless and unintrusive our hack is. It just sits there in your GCal, ready for you to knock.
It is so easy to use. You can literally get from loging in to booking your flights and hotels in literally 5 minutes (depending on your internet speed).
