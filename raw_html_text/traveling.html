                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something light-hearted, maybe a bit silly, but most of all fun. Vueling's challenge for this Hackathon seemed like the perfect opportunity to incorporate these elements into a project that served a purpose!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TraveLing is a simple 2D game where you have to try and guess the destinations a paper plane is flying to before it gets there, one beautiful European city at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used our JavaScript and responsive web skills to bring this idea to life as we felt it was the area we had the most expertise on, and therefore, how we could make justice to our idea it the most.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering the data we'd use (location, mapping data), putting together different services and API's into an unconventional environment and building the production version of the app in order to be able to be played from mobile phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're quite proud of the project as a whole! But most of all we're proud that we went from spending hours not quite knowing what to do to a full-fledged fun little game that could be played from start to finish on various platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about responsive web development, multi platform releasing and actually planning ahead for different platforms before we start hacking on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TraveLing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We see TraveLing as a little get-away from boredom when passengers might be waiting at the boarding gate, for example. It might even provide them with ideas for cities to visit next! We also think that, because of the simplistic nature of the game, it doesn't get boring and leaves room for improvement and expansion.
