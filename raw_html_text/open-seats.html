                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students spend many hours refreshing a registration page in the hopes to get an open seat. We wanted to automate that.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automate the class checking process.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a simple front end that will allow the user to add in his/her information. Then the script sends a get request from our heroku server, which will scrape the website with the user's input and will send a text to the number if it is available. If the class is not available it will keep running the request on the cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Different schools have different catalogs, therefore we had to use a specific school as an example.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    It works and it deploys. It actually texts.
                </p>

                    What we learned
