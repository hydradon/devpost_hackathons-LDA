                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were sitting at dinner one day and were wondering if there could be an easier way to decide what to cook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It analyzes a picture and identifies ingredients which are then used to look up recipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a deep convolution neural net (DCNN) to extract the primary ingredient in each photo, store those ingredients, and fed them into a recipe search engine API and report back the top results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally we wanted to use object localization, but it was too challenging and we ended up using object classification. Also, a chatbot was intended to be the front end but because of difficult web communications and no server, we opted for a Flask based front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The chatbot worked for about 3 questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Downloading and learning a new piece of software in the set time is difficult.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hopefully, integrating the chatbot and object detection.
