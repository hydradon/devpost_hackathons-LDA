                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got carpal tunnel programming. There are few to no programs that allow you to program using only your voice. We created Speakeasy to allow people to use speech to program. The applications we believe go beyond just programming if you can't use your hands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Prizes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that our project is a perfect fit for 2 prizes.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The first is the Microsoft missing piece prize. As I said earlier, the inspiration for this came when I couldn't find anything out there to help me when I was running into carpal tunnel. Additionally, it uses Microsoft Cognitive Services specifically the Bing Speech API.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We also believe it is eligible for the Health and Wellness prize. This is because as I stated the need for this came from the fact that I could not type anymore because of a condition with my hands. We believe that this project will help people who are predisposed to such conditions still be able to do their jobs (program or type) without the pain that can be associated with it.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Finally we believe that for many of the reasons stated above this project also qualifies for Everyday Usefulness prize. In addition to the reasons stated above, we think that there could be especially useful future applications for programming from a phone or on the go.

                <p>
                    It allows users to program using only their voice.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed the project in Python. We used Microsoft's Cognitive Service Speech API to get transcription's of voice recordings taken from the computer. Then we pass the transcription into a program that maps natural language to code in a language of your choosing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a lot harder to map natural language to code than we envisioned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get a working solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the speech API. As well as how to

                    What's next for Speakeasy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to build it out so that the project is more generic and works for any language the goal is to have it be more like a conversation with your laptop that is language agnostic.
