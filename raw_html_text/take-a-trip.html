                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most common practical workaholic life problem faced by people during ticket booking and time efficient journey to travel across the places using Indian Railway.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows the possible routes to the destination we want to travel by Indian Railway. It is not always possible to book ticket in direct route. For example we want to travel to Delhi from Phagwara, so it is not always possible to get a ticket directly to Delhi from Phagwara. So our web app will show fragmented routes where we can get confirmed ticket. Like Phagwara to Ludhiana, and Ludiana to Delhi. It is possible that we can book ticket to Ludhiana and again book from Ludhiana to New Delhi which is not possible with available apps in the market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used APIs of Indian Railway. We tried to use Train Between Stations API, Train Routes API and Ticket availability API. We wrote the backend in PHP. Inputs are boarding station and Destination and Train No. Using Train Route API we get the information about all the stations travelled by the train. API returns distance also so we find out the distance between the two stations we enter. We extract the information of stations which comes in between two stations. And show the possible combinations of routes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to internal server error we couldn't use ticket availability API and Train Between two stations API. So we couldn't implement our whole idea. Our idea was brief and we could have accomplished that. And we had to use assumptions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could complete at least one module.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnt new things. Use of APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Take a Trip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After this we will add the option to book ticket in fragmented routes.
