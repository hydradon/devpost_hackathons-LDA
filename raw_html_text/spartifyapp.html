                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have fun with music, more fun when in a party with your friends!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linked with your host and guest, join the same party, shaking your phone with the pattern set by the host to control the house's music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Parse as the backend server to handle user login system as well as the interaction between different devices.
As long as devices are connected with internet, communication is super smooth between the host and guest iOS devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our team members have been developed in iOS with Swift language before, also the Spotify API is written in Objective-C and lack of documentations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finally made it works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programming skill is important, while the team cooperation is much more essential
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SpartifyApp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more interactive actions to play with our iOS device in the party room!
