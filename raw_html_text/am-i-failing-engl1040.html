                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are competing for the "Best Data Project" by creating an app that will benefit university students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows the user input grades based on categories they have in a class (eg. The user would select that the class has 3 homeworks and 2 exams, and then would input the grades for what they have gotten so far) From there, the user can calculate their current grade in the class, and use the "forecast" button to determine what are the lowest grades they'd need to make on their upcoming assignments in order to get a specific grade (such as an A).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're building the app through Codename One and Netbeans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because this is our first hackathon, we spent most of our time learning and haven't got much of an app yet.
