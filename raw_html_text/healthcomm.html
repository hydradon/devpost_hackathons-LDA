                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As high school and college students, we understand the common practice of putting on a smile for your friends so they don&rsquo;t worry about you or venting common difficulties that all your friends can relate to and laugh about. However, social media is also a platform on which we can become our most vulnerable selves.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product has three main features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our sentiment analysis feature uses a python server and IBM Watson Natural Language Processing to filter in tweets and gives an overall score for depression. Our frontend will give a rating telling the friend is either "normal" or "depressed".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Community Matchmaker imports data from Google Firebase. When users signup, they indicate if they want to be a mentor or mentee and their profile information will appear on our Community Page along with a button to contact them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Resources Page gives helpful links for those who believe they need professional help.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used ReactJS to build the frontend and python for the backend and twitter sentiment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main trouble was connecting the frontend and backend, specifically displaying the JSON data from the twitter sentiment analysis onto our website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another problem is to develop a reliable way to classify depressed tweets and normal ones
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of not only creating a feature using machine learning, but providing a platform for communities to grow amongst other sharing the same struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that full stack development is a very useful tool and can allow for greater versatility when making products.
                </p>

                    What's next for HealthComm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One development is to further train our sentiment analyzer to detect more keywords and determine sentiment such as positivity, calm, stress, etc. rather than just depression which is a big assumption to make. Another further development is to create groups that users can join.
