                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to develop an app that would adequately address the increasingly serious problem of hearing loss and deafness. Once you lose your hearing, it doesn't come back. By preventing further hearing loss, we hope to encourage users to protect their hearing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Our web app provides an audiogram service and allows users to either share their audiogram on Facebook or refers users to nearby clinicians if their hearing problems are determined to be severe
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Javascript, React, d3, and Recharts to enhance the user experience and effectively engage with the user for an aesthetically pleasing audiogram.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning React for the first time was pretty challenging. We also encountered problems with the audio and playing it on the computer as opposed to speakers or headphones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found a lot of tools that we can use to fully implement all of the features we planned out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is an acute need to detect and treat hearing loss once it occurs so that the damage is minimized. We are proud of developing a user friendly, scalable solution to a widespread problem. We also learned a lot about how to use the different API's to access the information we need. We also learned a lot about styling a website and app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Better Listen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are thinking of adding compensation for adding headphones and ambient noise to better conduct the hearing test. It would also be nice to add a monitoring service that continuously monitors safe listening levels and alerts the user when the levels are no longer safe. We are also looking to develop a mobile app as part of a campaign to bring recognition of this problem to smartphone users and approach streaming companies such as Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, Tidal, and Soundcloud to expand our reach.
