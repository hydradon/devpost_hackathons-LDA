                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was playing around with the Emotion Microsoft API a while ago, and I really enjoyed how emotions could be found when a picture was taken. I also really enjoy music, so I thought it would be cool to mix the two and make a product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user takes a picture, and the api decides what moods the user is experiencing. Based on the mood, a certain song is played on Spotify.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used several different API's and used my background knowledge of html/css and javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I haven't really worked with many API's before, so it was a learning curve for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I usually do these hackathons with a group, so after all these years, it was cool to create something on my own. Hackathons are daunting for first-timers because you feel you're not good enough compared to all the other geniuses in the room. However, it ends up being less scary and more inspiring. It's cool that I got this far just in a few years.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned more about the specific API's, and learned how to learn.
                </p>
