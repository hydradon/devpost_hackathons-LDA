                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original hackathon project was not working. Midnight was approaching, and we were stressed. One team member took out a piece of paper and started drawing this smaller version of chess. From then on, we decided to build Arrow Chess
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Condenses the traditional game of chess.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was done in the front end. With modern advancements in browser technology, we were able to completely forgo a back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first project was a failure because the most important library for the project was not compatible with the rest of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to drag and drop in HTML and how to use git to work on the project together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ArrowChess
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Turn it into a mobile app and add more rules such as promoting the pawn into a new piece and winning by advancing the king to the enemy's side.
