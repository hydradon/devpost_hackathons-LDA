                <p>
                    I was actually at a loss for ideas and teammates when I started on this project. I also started this project relatively late, at 8:00PM of Saturday evening. I was glad to have been able to churn out the amount of code I had and make this project work.
                </p>

                    A more specific description

                <p>
                    FistBump runs on your terminal. It accesses your Spotify Playlist, uses the Echonest music analysis engine to understand the "brutality" and "hype" of the music in your Spotify Playlist and then, based on the gyrometer reading on your Myo armband, it fluctuates between "soft", "medium" and "hard" music categories. It's quite ridiculous. I registered the domain name "fistbump.club" from Domains.com and set it to the GitHub repo.

                    </code>
                    . It's bad practice to commit them on a Git repo. However, this is a Hackathon - this is war.
