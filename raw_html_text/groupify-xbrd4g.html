                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well we were inspired by ourselves since we were actually looking for teammates ourselves. It was really confusing to get all the incomplete teams to one room in the last minute and forming teams. This is really confusing and people end up puzzled.

                    So this app lets you apply as well as form teams once you have been accepted into the hackathon. Also this groups are done by mingling experienced and inexperienced people. This is done to give everyone a good experience by not leaving out any person idle or guilty for attending the hackathon.
