                <p>
                    As agents in the modern internet today, we click by many terms of service popups and other electronic agreements. While, frankly, we don't read most of them, there are some forms we want to confirm people have read such as an NDA or a contract for a new job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a few measures that could be implemented but they struggle to be very effective. One approach would be requiring a user to scroll the bottom of a document before selecting "Accept" but a decent mouse can zip right through that. Another approach would be setting a time for average read time but nothing's stopping me from pulling up Twitter and waiting for the timer to go off. So, what is a way that is not as easy to fake?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Determining whether or not a user is paying attention to a term of service agreement by reading their facial expression! Using a webcam, this product takes screenshots of your face and polls Google's Cloud Vision API for information about what you're expressing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Rationale
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we continue to become more immersed with technology (ie controlling your phone with hand gestures, smart mirrors/homes), it's only sensible we take advantage of the information we give by our facial expression!
