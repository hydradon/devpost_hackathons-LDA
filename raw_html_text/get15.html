                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a game called Get10. It's fun. But the browser version stops you at 10 and the mobile version has crappy ads. So I decided to make my own version that would let me play as long as I wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Opens a JFrame in which the game process runs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the skeleton of a Model/View/Controller setup from class. I created my own art resources from scratch using GIMP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the back end up to snuff was surprisingly tricky - it took many tries to get the tap function to correctly identify which squares to tap whilst still terminating its while loop. It was also a challenge getting the images to display correctly, due to the layout-less nature of the JLayeredPane I chose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overcoming the aforementioned challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to learn how to create action listeners with two dimensions of input using reflection. I also learned much more about how to use JLayeredPane.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Get15
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more time, I will work on non-core functionality and aesthetic tweaks. An example of the former is automatic loss detection (which I tried and failed to implement today), while the latter would involve some manner of animation during the collapse function. I will also experiment with different schema for random tile generation, and the possibility of smaller or larger challenge grids.
                </p>
