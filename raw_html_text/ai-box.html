                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To help those who have difficulty hearing

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the voice box hears "Repeat this,..." followed by a statement, it will repeat the statement back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Voice box kit which came with a Raspberry pi. We coded in python using Google's cloud API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to integrate a voice box with a vision box to detect images and output the name of the image through the speaker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After many failed attempts, we are proud that we were able to get our prototype to function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to set up a Raspberry Pi wirelessly through a hotspot and ssh client.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AI BOX
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would be to integrate the vison feature to our voice box to help the visually impared.
