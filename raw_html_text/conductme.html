                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ConductMe was inspired by our collective passion and interest in music. Our initial plan
involved using text analysis to generate the appropriate music given a particular story&rsquo;s tone. We
decided, however, to move in the direction of actually conducting music when we realized that
we had hardware such as Kinect available to us.

project; one consisted of researching a way to accurately calculate the BPM (beats&shy;per&shy;minute)
that relied on filtering for only lower&shy;frequency notes, identifying clusters of notes, and
calculating how often these clusters appeared. This was done by taking the raw data for the song
and passing it through the HTML5 Web Audio API. This was especially interesting because it
revealed the sophistication of the new HTML5 APIs, and it seems like an inspiring future for
high&shy;quality media apps on the web.

                    ConductMe uses the Kinect Motion Capture to track the velocity of a user&rsquo;s hand and calculate
the BPM at which he or she is conducting. The measured value is then used to adjust the speed
at which the music is being played at. ConductMe aims to give users more control over the
playback of their music, allowing them to experience music more interactively.

communicate with our web app; web sockets were created in both the web app and Visual Studio

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one person had experience with Node.js, and none had experience with any other SDKs
that were used; this in itself posed a challenge for us. There were two major components to this
of a song, and the other consisted of constructing a web app to both play songs and interact with
users to speed up and slow down playback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calculating the BPM posed a challenge for several reasons; the first and foremost is that music
formats don&rsquo;t expose lower&shy;level song properties (e.g. BPM!). Eventually, we found a method

Constructing the web app was more straightforward but involved more work; we had to build a
web app using Node that would post audio files to the server, where the server would store and
analyze the files, sending the results back to the client who would appropriately respond and
change playback.

                    Most challenging of all was working with Kinect. The majority of the issues we had while
beginning was getting set&shy;up and becoming familiar with the environment; because of the slow
internet (to say the least) and the number and size of SDKs that we had to install to grab input
from the Kinect, we weren&rsquo;t able to start working with the Kinect until about twelve hours into
the hackathon. Moreover, after spending a few hours with Unity paring down useless objects
and writing VB code to parse Kinect input, we found that Unity continually crashed; it became necessary to restart Unity after every single test we ran.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of what we learned consisted of gaining experience in APIs and languages that we had
never used before. It was the first time that any of us had seen C#, Visual Studio, and Unity, and
most of us had little to no experience with web development, let alone Node.js and its libraries.

                <p>
                    ConductMe can be applied for both recreational and educational purposes. It can help rising
ensemble. For the general public, it allows people to adjust music speed, fast forwarding and
slowing down at their leisure with a small wave of the hand. This could have applications to
audio files of all types. For example, students could use ConductMe to easily play audio lectures
More hand signals could also be integrated into the ConductMe program. A closed fist could
signal the program to pause the audio and an open hand could signal the program to play. A
waving hand could be used to switch to the next song.

Conductors gain awareness of the impact their gestures have on the speed and volume of the
aloud at 2x speed.

                <p>
                    ConductMe could be influential beyond the audio world if we can link it to the video file as well as the audio . ConductMe would then empower the user to control playing speed of videos as well.
