                    Model's meta data or we say properties are very important for the architect or engineers. So we thought that if we could export properties to any easy readable format then it will be very useful for ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It creates excel sheet with model's meta data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It built using Jquery, PHP and Ajax which are using Forge APIs call to access models data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are very few challenges I faced for example arranging JSON output in excel sheet according to property name and values. And also some sort of challenges in call back from one file to other file and data transfer between these.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app can produce a excel sheet with well arranged part properties and it key value pair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned the use of Forge cloud platform using rest API call. And I found Forge platform very useful specially for cloud solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In next I am planning to give options for exporting metadata to PDF and also selection for property type in case use does not need every properties to export.
