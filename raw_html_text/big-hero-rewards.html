                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Toronto has been experiencing increasing gun violence since 2015. We wanted to reduce gun violence by reducing the incentives for youth to join a gang because gang violence drives gun violence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Big Hero Rewards app gives HRO tokens to youth who complete educational workshops and activities approved by the rewards program, which can be exchanged at partner retailers for food, clothing, transportation tickets, entertainment (ex. movie passes) and more! By engaging youth and building a community around the youth, we reduce their incentive to join a gang because they're looking for a sense of belonging and want to make money. We are also building a blockchain record of the youth's educational activities that they're able to show to future employers to obtain a junior developer or junior blockchain developer position even without completing their formal education.
                </p>
