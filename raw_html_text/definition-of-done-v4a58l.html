                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A good Definition of Done is vital to remind an Agile team of their commitments, but working with remote teams means it is not possible to keep this visible on a whiteboard or wall poster.  I wanted an equivalent in JIRA to make sure viewing the Definition of Done is as easy as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Allows the Team to record their Definition of Done activities against the project (via the project side-bar).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Anyone with view issues permission can see a summary of the Definition of Done on each issue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A pop-up dialog can be displayed from any issue within the project, to check the full details within the Definition of Done.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using the Atlassian Connect Express framework in Node.js.  I also decided to take advantage of the new JIRA Entity properties to store the Definition of Done against the project in JIRA.  Avoiding the need to maintain a datastore and ensure there were no data privacy issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first every JIRA or Confluence add-on and also my first in Node.js after studying courses, so challenges were plenty.  Specifically I found the the Add and Delete buttons (and associated code) a good challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Learning all the intricacies of the Atlassian Connect Express framework and AUI.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensuring the UI on the Project view (where you can Add/Delete activities) did not need a full refresh on every edit, providing a much cleaner user experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Additionally (and although not eventually used), I'm proud of writing the async functions to find the appropriate Project ID from the Agile boards in JIRA.  This was not provided as a context parameter.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a Node.js course and studying the Atlassian Connect samples I thought I could achieve lots, but writing my own add-on from scratch really helped me discover the full lifecycle of an add-on and how to overcome certain challenges.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Adding the Definition of Done criteria into the workflow, so anyone in the Agile team is reminded of the activities before they close a story or other backlog item.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Providing an estimation view for issues, allowing teams to clearly view the full DoD alongside the story when in Planning Poker sessions.
