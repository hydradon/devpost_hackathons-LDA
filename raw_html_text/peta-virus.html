                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The PETA virus is inspired by and shares many characteristics with the infamous Petya ransomware that infected many Windows PCs just three years ago. The issue is that this ransomware will allow you to recover your files that it encrypts, albeit at a cost, and in addition, it has been cracked and a master key is available that will decrypt most versions of the ransomware. So, for this project, we decided to turn Petya, an infuriating but recoverable ransomware into a
                    <strong>
                        completely irreversible
                    </strong>
                    and malicious piece of code that causes fatal damage to Windows PCs. And it can all happen simply by plugging in a flash drive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The PETA virus is a portable piece of malware injected onto a flash drive that can be started by simply opening a malicious executable disguised as a convincing PDF persuading the user to open it. Once a gullible victim opens the file, the executable launches, enabling another one to cause the MBR to be overwritten and the Windows system encrypted. While the payload operates, performance of your PC will drastically drop and applications will run slower. Shortly after, the PC will crash and a Blue Screen of Death will open. When the computer is reset, Windows will no longer boot. Once this happens, the malware's work is complete. And to think all of this can be prevented by simply refusing to open a PDF just adds insult to injury.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app originally off of just batch code, but we quickly realized this was not a permanent or lethal enough solution. We quickly turned to online repositories, and came across a 2016 trojan that did not require any administrator prompts to run or be detected by most anti-virus software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, the main executable used to start the malicious code was only detected as dangerous by 10% of anti-virus software, as shown in this free online virus tester:
                    <a href="https://bit.ly/2qdz46S" rel="nofollow">
                        https://bit.ly/2qdz46S
                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then built our deployment method around that, disguised as a PDF. The moment the PDF is opened, malicious code wipes the Master Boot Record, rendering your computer a high-tech paperweight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User Account Control was the bane of our existence. No matter what payload we loaded, it would always demand an administrator password, not ideal for most standard users. Another problem was executing the PDF. We would have liked to have it execute the moment the USB mounts, but sadly Windows fixed that back in Windows ME.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create a mass-distributive virus with relatively simple code that would destroy the computer of any of those unfortunate to open the PDFs. That alone gives us an immense sense of accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned that the User Account Control is one of the most useful barricades for simple malware.

                <h2>
                    What's next for PETA virus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to outfit this virus with new payloads, possibly creating a worm or botnet. These are to display the blatant vulnerabilities in Windows 10, and alert people that some skilled teenagers can decimate a school intranet or dox a server.

                    How to run it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Copy and paste the link into a Windows 10
                    <strong>
                        VIRTUAL MACHINE
                    </strong>
                    and then download it. Unzip and copy the root to a USB flash drive. Then open up the executable titled "PhysicsAnswers_232.pdf" and wait for the payload.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again, please run it on a
                    <strong>
                        VIRTUAL MACHINE, NOT REAL HARDWARE!
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also recommend
                    <strong>
                        disconnecting your Internet before testing
                    </strong>
                    to prevent the malware from
                    <strong>
                        potentially spreading in your network

                <p>
                    There are great virtualization software choices for all platforms:
For Windows and Linux, we recommend VMware Workstation Player, which is free for personal use but paid for commercial:

                    </a>
                    For Mac, we recommend VMware Fusion, which has a 30 day free evaluation period:

                        To prevent possible infection of your physical system, if possible, make sure the bootloader is set to UEFI and make sure that you are creating a local account instead of a Microsoft account when setting up Windows 10.

                    if you open the malware outside of virtualization software and your PC is bricked.
