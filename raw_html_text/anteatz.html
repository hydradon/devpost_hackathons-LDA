                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to be able to graduate from UCI knowing that we have left something behind for future AntEaters to use
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AntEatz provides students easy access to buying meal swipes at dining locations located on campus. Students can create an account to message other students who are sellers via
                    <strong>
                        Twilio
                    </strong>
                    SMS. AntEatz provides a real-time feed of swipes that can be purchased at an indicated time. This service is a better alternative because unlike Facebook, the posts on our real-time feed are swipes that have not been purchased yet which can be convenient for the user when searching for some swipes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AntEatz was developed using Google Cloud SQL as our database to store account information and food swipe posts. The Backend of our application was built with Java using Grizzly and Jersey which handled our REST calls. The Frontend was built with React JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A couple of things that we ran into as a team was that we weren't able to connect to a local network database. So, we opted to using Google Cloud SQL but it took us some time to establish a connection. The second issue that we ran into was calling the backend code from our front end since we were using XMLH. However, we resolved this really fast by using Axios instead which made things a lot easier. The final reason was that HackUCI was hosted peek midterm szn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gaining experience with Frontend coding... or just attempting a full stack project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project helped us learn a lot about the resources that we have out there that can be easily used such as Google Cloud SQL and Twilio. We also learned a lot of Frontend stuff since that wasn't really our strong point to begin with and also more about how powerful tools such as Gradle are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AntEatz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expect us to drop a fully developed website for UCI students. (and maybe some fee charges along with that hehe xd)
