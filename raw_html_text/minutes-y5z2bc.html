                    Significance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CDC reports that over 44 million American adults have a mental health condition. The rate of youth experiencing mental health issues continue rising with 62% of teens and children who are majorly affected receiving no treatment. The report states that 12.2% of adults with a mental illness remain uninsured and 56.4% of adults receiving no treatment at all. That&rsquo;s over 24 million untreated individuals who are experiencing a mental health illness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So why is this significant? Mental disorders play an overwhelming role in the increased risk of suicide&mdash;with estimates suggesting up to 90% of individuals who take their own life suffer from some type of psychiatric disorder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The lack of sufficient inpatient and outpatient services as well as medical costs serve as great barriers in the fight for sanity of the mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Post discharge, many patients have no contact with their outpatient mental health provider until weeks or months after discharge. Establishing case management services for patients with complex mental health needs can take up to 60 or even 90 days as the referrals for services make their way through the approval process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A severe shortage of mental health clinicians is just adding to the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our Plan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Journal for discharged patients and those who don&rsquo;t have access to mental health services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Features: Chat-bot, Journal, Calendar
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user will be able to journal their thoughts. The entry will be examined by AWS to customize a chat bot that the user can also use. Using AWS Comprehend we can look at key phrases and intent of what the user writes in order to keep tabs on their mental health. A chat-bot using AWS Lex will then proceed to have a sort of "catch up" chat with the user. We hope for it to be a service anyone can chat with whenever they feel they need to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app will give people a new way to take care of themselves, since you can't keep a therapist for forever. It fills the significant gap and acts as a safety net for those at risk of suicide.
