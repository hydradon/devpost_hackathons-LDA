                    A small Android app I wrote for HackNYU 2017. 
The idea behind it is that students with school meal plans tend to try and save their meals in case they might need them later, which generally ends up in them having lots of leftover money at the end of the semester and buying out the entire cafeteria to try and spend it before it expires.
This app takes in the number of meals a student has on their plan, how much money they have to spend, and how much longer they have in the semester, and gives them a schedule for their meals for the week.
For example, it might say to use meals from their plan for lunch and dinner, and to eat breakfast at home and spend this much money at a restaurant for dinner the next day.
Possible features that could be added in the future include allowing users to automatically deduct meals and/or money from the remaining amount after using them, and using an API like Yelp's to display a list of nearby restaurants which would be easy on a student's budget.
