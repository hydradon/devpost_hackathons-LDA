                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wondered what it would sound like if Reddit comments were read out loud? We did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a Chrome extension that reads out Reddit comments about whatever page you are currently viewing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever you visit a page a js file in the extension runs. It calls the Reddit API to find any comments it can, and then it uses the web-voice api implemented in Chrome to read out the comments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web voice api does not work very well, it is slow to respond and cant handle much text at once. We had to chunk the comments down to make it work, and be careful to not request too many chunks at a time.
The reddit API wrapper we used is inconsistent in returned results, so many edge cases had to be checked.
The reddit API itself didn't always seem to return the correct results. for example if you search a front page link, the front page result often doesn't appear. There is nothing we could do about this, but it left us doing a lot of debugging on a non issue.  It also doesnt seem to order results excactly as the documentation says it does.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works fairly well, can handle multiple pages open at once.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Always Reddit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Give each comment a different voice to make it sound more interesting. 
Making the pronunciation of link less awkward.
