                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Babies love white noise. We first learned this fact from&nbsp;Dr. Harvey Karp's movie "The Happiest Baby on the Block". Newborns, after nine long months in the womb, are used to the monotonic sounds they heard constantly inside their mother&rsquo;s body. 
When our first son arrived, we started using YouTube for this purpose, and found that the sound of rain was amazingly calming to him. But it was so inconvenient to start fumbling with our computer in the middle of the night...that was quite a pain.&nbsp;So we decided to build Alexa skill that would help to soothe our children to sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our skill plays the soothing and natural sound of rain for a variety of durations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the skill using Java language.

                <p>
                    We are planning to create a series of skills that would allow parents to track all the events related to taking care and raising their children: feeding and breastfeeding, sleeps and naps, sicknesses and doctor's appointments, etc.
