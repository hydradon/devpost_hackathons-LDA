                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed too many high school students cramming for auditions, competitions, exams, etc. We wanted to help students better plan out their practice so that they can avoid cramming and be more successful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students enter in the date of their audition, competition, exam, etc. and select a difficulty level (1, 2, or 3) and Practice Time tells them how much they should practice each day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS in Sublime.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out how to make the calculator work, spent a very long time fixing margins, mistakes, etc., and learning how to code (as we had never coded our own project before).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the design and all of the code behind the project, along with completing our first project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript (which we didn't end up using).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Practice Time!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next time, we would like to include a calendar and a page that gives practice tips.
