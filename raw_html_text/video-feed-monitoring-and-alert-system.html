                    Our final product for GE Hackathon contains a series of essential features that will help companies and institutions to monitor their assets on a continuous and large-scale basis. Our product continuously collects temperature, GPS, humidity, and a few other types of sensor data from the asset, and provides data visualization for customers. For example, the location of a Model-T car will be presented on a map for simplified asset tracking. In addition, the built-in alert system will also notify customers if their assets are experiencing overheat, extreme humidity or other situations that will potentially damage the assets. Utilizing the latest technology from Amazon, customers can also inquire about the status of their asset through Amazon Echo and view it on Echo Show. This added benefit greatly improves the overall user-experience of our product. Our customers will also have the option to install cameras on their assets and our algorithm will use the video feed to monitor product safety.
