                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At Mudd, the Core Curriculum often requires students to use various math programs such as LaTeX, Mathematica, and MATLAB. Each has a different syntax, so we want to help translate math expressions across these different languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can convert LaTeX expressions into Mathematica and MATLAB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a modular structure where multiple languages can be converted into our intermediate language, which is then rendered into the desired output. Thus, this structure allows us to easily add more input and output languages in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsing the math expressions was the most challenging aspect, and ultimately, we had to focus only on parsing one language (LaTeX) as opposed to parsing 3 languages in one night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a project useful for Core Curriculum assignments. This will benefit students in technical fields such as math, physics, and engineering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our teammates picked up Javascript for the first time as well as Mathematica syntax. All of us got a better understanding of parsing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Tiresias
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand this project to parse more languages. We would work on parsing Mathematica and MATLAB, as we had originally intended, but we are also looking at other languages such as Maple (used in physics).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we are interested in integrating the WolframAlpha API in order to parse natural languages and add insight to our output.
