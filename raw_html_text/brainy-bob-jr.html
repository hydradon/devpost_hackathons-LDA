                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Robots are really fun, but alas they may take over the world someday.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brainy Bob Jr is a robot that moves. When he senses something is in front of him, he spins and turns right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Brainy Bob Jr is built using MakeBlock and an Arduino board
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was tough to get Bob to turn.

                    When we finally got Bob to turn!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Screws are hard to screw in. We learned how to use Bob to show temperature.
