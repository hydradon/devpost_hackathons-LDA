                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The latest energy management solutions for households currently involve local data gathering and also present a huge scaling problem. With the availability of cloud computing, we are able to collect all the data from various households anonymously to build a power consumption model of a typical household which can then be fedback to the user to improve their energy consumption habits and reduce their energy bills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rising energy bill costs are a bane to a household owner and are a huge waste of energy to the extent that it accounts for 10% of the lowest income earner's household expenditure. We set out to find a solution which can be implemented on a wide scale with predictive analytics.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our system will learn the energy behaviour models of various households while trying to optimise the power usage based on occupancy. Usage patterns and occupancy data are gathered by the mBed Connect Cloud Development Board and transferred into a cloud based platform. This allows the optimised energy profiles learned over time to be generalised over other household users with similar usage patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can then view the data online through our dashboards, which will allow them to manually track and monitor their energy consumption.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There 3 key elements to our system:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Data Gathering
                    </strong>
                    The mbed Connect Cloud board is fixed to a door of a room and measures a list of 9 different parameters. This packet contains the maximum value of each of the sensor readings over an interval of 10 minutes. The sampling rate of the sensors before maximum thresholding is 100ms. The fast sampling time is particularly key for the accelerometer and temperature which we use to detect the opening or closing of doors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Sending data to the cloud
                    </strong>
                    A HTTP request is sent by the mbed Connect Cloud board to the server which contains the maximum thresholded sensor readings since the last measurement was pushed to the cloud. This is done on a low frequency loop (approx every 10-15 minutes) to save power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Data Processing and Visualisation
                    </strong>
                    These sensor readings are then fed into a server with JavaScript code which visualises the history of the data. 3 different views are presented to the user: Raw Data for the technically minded, one targeted for the tenant which shows a detailed breakdown and a final dashboard for the landlord which is less detailed but shows a broad picture of energy usage patterns for that estate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to connect the mBed Cloud Connect Device to a more scalable cloud system such as the mBed Cloud. However, this was not possible as the mBed Cloud was only open for early preview access. Thus, we decided to write our own web servers to process the data from the mBed Cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are able to collect data from the mBed Cloud in real time, but it was harder to dynamically update the javascript display graphs in real time, and is definitely something that we feel would not be too hard to achieve within the framework that we've created for the program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One last major stumbling block for us was our requirement for much more long term data. As our projects requires 2-3 weeks worth of occupancy and power data, it was not possible to collect all of it within the time frame allocated for the hackathon. Thus, we had to search online for similar datasets so as to allow us to seed our models and graphs, which took quite a long while to process and plot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to integrate a HTTP request response framework to send data from the mBed cloud connect to the websetver running in Flask. This helped us to reduce the number of processes that we had to run, and helped to reduce concerns about thread safety and IPC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also managed to find good real world data sets that gave us tremendous insight into the problem at hand, and which allowed us to give our models much more realistic data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also managed to build a clean UI that is appealing and responsive. The UI was written mainly in Javascript, and provides a user-friendly interface that allows the end-user to view and manipulate the data from the mBed sensor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The front end UI is extremely portable to a variety of projects, and is thus ideal for allowing rapid prototyping of data science and information gathering projects.
