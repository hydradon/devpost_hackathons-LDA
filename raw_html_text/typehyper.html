                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from the urge to write and create stories, while not having enough motivation to follow through. Many people try and write everyday, short stories/ answering prompts, and this will make it easier for them to stay on task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to write into a javaScript webApp, with the option to answer a prompt or just write on your own. If the user stops writing, for a couple seconds, a rather annoying video will start playing, which will pause once the user starts writing again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is build off of javascript and html, and hosted on S3 on AWS. It also has flask capability with python to be hosted locally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us were new to web development, so mostly the javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How smooth it runs in the end. I even tried to follow a prompt myself, and found it much easier to sit down and write, with no fear of fault in writing, because there is no room to have faultless writing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned javascript, and how to make a dynamic web app, hosted on aws(s3).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TypeHyper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next would be more features, like text-to-speech, so people can practice fluid dictation.Other possibilities would be an optional word counter, and an improved UI.
