                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I came to college excited for the endless opportunities and soon became stifled by them. About once a week, I would redesign my four years at Carolina with a different major-minor combination in mind; however, the redesigning process would take a long time because UNC has no user-interface for visualizing all the required classes of a major. I kept making grids in Microsoft Word, until I finally declared Computer Science as my major &ndash; fourth time&rsquo;s a charm. Right after I finished our secondary java course, I went home over winter break and made a java scheduling app. However, I found that executable jars are not great for sharing an app, so I came into this hack-a-thon with the goal of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in 24 hours in order to
                    <strong>
                        help other students visualize their 4 years
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can select a UNC major &ndash; I only had time to load 4 in from our academic worksheets -- add individual classes, or upload a unique course list as a text file -- which makes the app usable for students at other universities. Once uploaded, you can drag classes to other semesters or delete them all together. It&rsquo;s also mobile friendly!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After going through the Mozilla Developer Network training on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I compiled the program to add classes from an input or a pre-prepared list (such as CS_BA). I used Sortable, a JS library for dragging and deleting elements in a list. I used
                    <a href="http://www.logomakr.com" rel="nofollow">
                        www.logomakr.com
                    </a>
                    to get the base for my logo, and I relied on GitHub for hosting the site.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent about 3 hours trying to load in local text files &ndash; one for each major at Carolina &ndash; and I couldn&rsquo;t get it to accept the files, so I had to make an array in the css page for each major.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am really proud of how I was able to get the file upload to work and that I got the classes to drag from one semester to the next. Overall, I would have never guessed I could have done this in one day, so thank you Pearl Hacks for the motivation!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that JavaScript is so much simpler than Java!! It took me so much longer to do the same thing in Java, implementing model-view-controller, but with JavaScript I didn&rsquo;t have to make class objects, I could just create divs and load text into them! I can&rsquo;t wait to use JavaScript more!

                    What's next for Plan Carolina
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to have all the courses put into a JSON file so I can add elements to them like difficulty &ndash; which would be cool to crowd source &ndash; so that students can balance the difficulty of their semesters.
