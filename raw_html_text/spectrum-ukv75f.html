                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Color blindness affects as much as around 4-5% of the population of US. We aim to create a system for people with color blindness to correctly recognise colors which they are unable to perceive.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built on Android. Through the in-built smartphone cam, a user can take any picture. We use Microsoft's
                    <em>
                        Computer Vision API
                    </em>
                    to recognise the image's dominant and accent colors and display them correctly on the user's app. providing a comparison of what the user perceives and what the actual color is.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built on Android. I used Google's networking library Volley to send a POST request and get JSON response from the Microsoft API.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every image can have multiple colors. It was tough to create a method by which every area of a specific color could be highlighted for the user.
