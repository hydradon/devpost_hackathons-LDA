                    It was my Mom&rsquo;s birthday and I wanted to surprise her. We had just finished dinner, and I casually leaned toward our Echo and said, &ldquo;Alexa, open Birthday Story.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    You see, I had just gotten an email from Amazon about &ldquo;Blueprints&rdquo; and I couldn&rsquo;t believe the possibilities. What?? You could make Alexa tell stories? Get her to say anything you wanted just by filling in some boxes? So I used the Fairy Tale template, spun a festive tale, and dubbed my mother, Princess Joan. She loved it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And we&rsquo;ve been calling her Princess Joan ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skill that I&rsquo;m submitting for feedback is the second version of the Princess Joan story. It has evolved from a fun family birthday gesture into an interactive bedtime story for kids. The narrative has a branching structure, and whichever way you go, it takes about 7-10 minutes to get to the song at the end.

                    I built it using Voice Apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, I ran into a ton of challenges along the way. I have no training in programming. I&rsquo;m a writer. Functions, variables&hellip;yikes! Just learning the basic vocabulary of JavaScript was daunting. But I really enjoyed spending hours on end tinkering with SSML, trying to make Alexa sound like a Valley girl from the 80&rsquo;s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So yeah, I was really happy when I finished my skill and sent it out into the world. I know there&rsquo;s still so much to learn, but hey, I was able to make a talking frog interact with the listener, tell bad jokes in a gruff male voice, and then pause for 0.8 seconds between the setup and the punchline. And for that little merging of fiction and tech, this non-programmer was enormously proud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What&rsquo;s next for Princess Joan?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m interested in finding new ways to tell stories. I think there is so much potential right now in Voice, and any feedback or suggestions that you could send would be warmly welcomed.
