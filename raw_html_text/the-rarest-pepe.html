                        Rare Pepes
                    </a>
                    depreciating in value as they are redistributed and viewed - becoming more common with each share or set of prying eyes - we sought a solution to create the Rarest Pepe possible while simultaneously keeping it safe from prying eyes, forever. We were inspired by the art of Chindogu - while the meme we create is priceless in its uniqueness and rarity, the feature that maintains its uniqueness prevents anyone from ever seeing it - barring either cracked encryption or the psychic visions of  Madame Zandra.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon insertion of a USB drive into our Raspberry Pi, a fresh Rare Pepe is generated, encrypted, and deposited on the drive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Python library OpenCV to randomly manipulate a stock image of Pepe to create a unique, never before seen variation on the meme. We used gpg encryption to prevent prying eyes from viewing our new rare meme. All of this was automated with Bash scripting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of issues getting the Pi up and running - fresh out of the box, our Bluetooth keyboard didn't work with it until we'd upgraded the kernel, the distribution, and run a few apt-get upgrades, which took forever on the limited hardware. We had trouble finding the freshly inserted USB to write to in the filesystem as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning more about encryption and automation in Linux.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of our teammates very little experience with Linux previously. We've learned how to encrypt files with gpg and how to utilize OpenCV to randomly modify images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Rarest Pepe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our automation isn't fully functional at time of writing. We're having trouble finding the disk to write the new meme to. We'd like to spruce things up a bit - a custom Pepe case for the Pi seems in order. More advanced image manipulation technology is possible - we could draw from a larger pool of source images, and modify them in a more complicated and more aesthetically pleasing way. A stretch goal would be image generation with a neural network, trained on a database of rare Pepes to create entirely fresh memes.
