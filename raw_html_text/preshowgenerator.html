                <p>
                    PreshowGenerator is a desktop-based Python applet that compiles a preshow for any given film. When the file for a film has been selected by the user, The Movie DB is consulted to pull popular, upcoming new releases that match on both genre and studio. This is interwoven with cinematic-style interstitials, enabling users to replicate their authentic theatrical experience in their home theaters.

                    Configuration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Configuration includes as an optional selection for additional policy trailers informing the viewer to turn off their phones and get snacks from the lobby. The number of trailers can vary from one to five, and the user can opt to disable red-band trailers. The library requirements are listed in the requirements.txt, and also include internet access and a free TMDB API Key.
