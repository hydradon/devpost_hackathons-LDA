                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the age of personalized searches and algorithmic recommendation, the
                    <strong>
                        filter bubble
                    </strong>
                    is increasingly becoming a social and political problem. The term filter bubble, coined by Internet activist Eli Pariser, refers to a state of
                    <strong>
                        intellectual isolation
                    </strong>
                    as a result of
                    <strong>
                        a recommendation algorithm selectively guesses what content a user would like to see based on information about the user
                    </strong>
                    , such as location, past click-behavior and search history. In consequence, users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles(To learn more about filter bubble, please refer to
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;Contrasting views also deserve to be recommended in such cases&rdquo;. With this idea, we designed this clustering and recommendation system with completely different recommendation principles. In contrast to traditional recommendation algorithm which regards entertaining and engaging users as the first principle, Bubble Terminator would help users understand the position he/she stands in the big picture of a problem/topic and brings users a brand new perspective, aiming to encourage having deeper awareness of a problem and exchange of different ideologies.

                    The chrome extension is written in

                        Javascript

                    </strong>
                    . We use

                    </strong>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, of course, is to get the machine learning model up and running. Generally, we find that the model tent to predict sentences as a Democrat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, is to build the extension. No one from our team had experience building a chrome extension from scratch before the hackathon, so we had done a lot of exploration and experiments in the past 24 hours. Also, chrome imposes strict checks on network requests that its extensions make: they must be over HTTPS and with a trusted host. It took us some time to figure out how to make a self-signed SSL certificate work in chrome. Later on, we obtained a trusted SSL certificate with a domain name.
