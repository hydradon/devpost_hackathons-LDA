                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the history of computer science (and how far we have come) that is not often talked about, and combining it with cryptography which is an important aspect of cybersecurity. Then we combined these ideas with Back to the Future (and time travelling) to add a twist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an interactive game that takes the user (ideally 12+) through history and teaches them about the origins and advancements of cryptography.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will involve various historic scenes that teach them how to use different cryptographic methods by solving puzzles to get back to the present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the concept and ideas for various levels of the game, as well as mock-up visuals for the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the game interesting and engaging was a challenge, as well as making advanced concepts simple enough for beginners to grasp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our idea because we took something that typically wouldn't be mixed (history and cryptography) and made it into an entertaining educational game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to engage younger audiences and cater to them while also teaching them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Back to the Cipher
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now that we have the idea and examples of levels, our next step is to implement the game for users to actually play.
