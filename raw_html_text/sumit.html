                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All four of us are outdoor enthusiasts. We try to get outside at any opportunity possible to enjoy the fresh air, scenery, and exercise. Unfortunately, it is hard to prioritize time outdoors with work, school, and everything else that competes for our time. We decided to make this app to gameify outdoor adventures to help them rise up the priority list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sumit awards points for reaching impressive destinations. These destinations could include the top of a peak, the middle of a ski run, or the bottom of a slot canyon. Each user has to take a picture at the geotagged location to add the points to their sum. After a user has submitted their picture, they unlock the ability to see the pictures of everybody else who has visited as well. A leaderboard shows how big your sum is compared to your peers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built two native apps - one for iOS and one for Android. These apps are supported by a database and custom API that store and manipulate data. We use the Google Maps API to display the destinations on a map and compare the geographical coordinates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app relies on a series of network requests that connect several different platforms. We had trouble connecting to the wifi in the Lassonde Center so we had to be creative and efficient to make sure that all of our calls were working correctly without wasting too much time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud that we were able to create an application that works seamlessly over two mobile platforms with so many external libraries and databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all improved at GUI design and implementation, database design, networking, and cross-platform development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sumit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to launch on the app store this winter and partner with local outdoor retailers to host competitions to win free gear. Some ideas for competitions include - most points in 24 hours, most creative picture at a certain location, and most consistent at exercising outdoors over a month.
