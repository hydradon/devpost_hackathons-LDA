                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team member is an artist, and he is always looking for feedback on his works. So he brought up and idea to make a platform that makes it easy for artist to convey their thoughts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creative IDE is essentially an online inspiration that users can utilize to share artworks with other artists. It has a simple tree of folders on the left side of the interface to promote easy access to file and simplicity. Music can also be played and paired with the artwork to create an environment suitable for creativity. The combination can also be sent to others to clearly convey thoughts and meaning through music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built with Java utilizing JTree to create the folder selection part JFrame. The Images to display the images in the files onto the GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges that plagued us were due to lack of knowledge about GUI and Images, basically most of the entire project. Time was spent researching ways to implement the JTree design, images, and music.  Many times, the implementation that we learned was too complicated to use, so tests had to be performed to find which ones actually worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a new and functioning GUI and displaying images when none of the team members know how to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a basic GUI with Listeners along with parsing through files opening them onto the display. We also learned how to implement music into the project. As some of our time members are first time Hackathons participants, we also learned how to collectively work in a team to share ideas and help each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Creative IDE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next for Creative IDE is making it more user friendly, easier to share, and easier to convey feelings. The next step is to allow the user to create files right in the GUI and add or delete files. When users add files, an option to embed music, add an annotation, or even add another picture to as a background. The sharing can be implemented through a created code which the user can give to his or her friend to share. Another feature can be commenting or a group chat to public receive feedback.
