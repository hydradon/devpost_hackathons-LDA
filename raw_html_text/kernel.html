                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to learn Rust, and I know how to work the Pi from C and have a bunch of code that does that, so I thought it would be fun to try and build an interactive computer out of the Raspberry Pi from scratch, using all Rust code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a bare-metal program that runs on the Raspberry Pi. It's like an operating system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You copy it to a SD card, put it in the Pi, and turn the thing on, and plug it into a monitor and a keyboard. It gives you a console. It talks to the Pi's video card, to the serial device on the board, and to a PS/2 keyboard. You can type and see things on the screen (I bundled a font).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The console has one actual command so far:
                    <code>
                        reset
                    </code>
                    (which I implemented so that I could recompile and update it fast!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the code running on the computer (except some standard library functions that format strings and stuff) is Rust code that I wrote this weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I mostly worked off of C code&nbsp;I had lying around. I wrote drivers in Rust for part of the GPU, for the serial peripheral, and to turn pins on and off. I made a basic console and found a bitmap font online to display letters. I wrote a PS/2 client that uses the serial line to read scancodes from a PS/2 keyboard, so you can type.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest part was getting it to build; that took like most of a day, when I started actually trying to use the Rust standard library and it started complaining. The key insight there was using gc-sections in the linker and then stubbing out the remaining symbols.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rust is also missing a couple important things from C: I had a ton of trouble aligning things in memory and getting data from the linker into the program. Volatile is kind of a pain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code is probably really un-idiomatic Rust. Tons of unsafe blocks. The I/O stuff, talking to hardware, is messier than in C, but the programming on top of the I/O layer is nicer in Rust.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to get interrupts to work, and how to pass linker information into prologue functions in Rust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PS/2 driver I wrote is a ton nicer in Rust than it is in C, because it's basically a state machine, and Rust has way more expressive types.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's cool that Rust catches exceptions, and I set up a way for them to get reported to me, too. Surprisingly civilized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rust is pretty neat. It's not that hard to code in it. And I like that I know what's unsafe so I can clean it up later if I want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for kernel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was working on connecting to an ESP8266 but the power draw is too much, I think. That would let you do web browsing and wireless connection to a real computer. You could update it over the air, maybe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Onboard programming language -- some kind of Lisp variant? This would really test whether Rust is better for general programming than C.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GUI? PS/2 mouse support would be a natural next step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Improve style, use the concurrency stuff in Rust and make things safer. Figure out where unsafe really belongs. Get better types on things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some kind of persistent storage, like on the SD card? The main thing MS-DOS has that I don't right now.
