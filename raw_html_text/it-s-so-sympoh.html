                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all part of a breaking crew on campus, but we were also all beginners.  We wanted to create something that allows someone to improve the dancing skills with a simple app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a java application that allows you to select a video of yourself dancing to a particular choreography.  Assuming the user already knows the youtube link of the video they want to compare to, the app asks for the user to input an embedded youtube link.  The application will then play both videos side by side, allow the user to play the videos until the desired starting point and then press a button to play both at the same time.  We also created a website for our breaking crew with youtube tutorials for break dancing basics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is completely java based.  There is a basic GUI built with JFrames.  It allows the user to select a file using JFileChooser.  The application then takes the video and plays it with help from VLCJ library,  a java framework for the VLC Media Player.  The other video is displayed directly with the Youtube Player by using NativeSwing Web browser panels.  Since the youtube player is just a web browser panel, to pause the video with another function, we used Robot to manual move the mouse to the pause button of the Youtube Player and click on it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are mostly first-time hackers with very little experience outside of java and no practical experience, everything was a challenge.  Our website design was built with HTML and CSS which no one knew beforehand.  We have never worked with GUIs, and the GUI for java seemed very complicated.  Getting everything to work with all the different types of files we were working with was a challenge.  Only knowing one language limited our capabilities immensely.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting anything and everything to work
Even though everything was fudged together like no other and anybody looking at the code will just cry, getting things to work even though we knew nothing about the subject beforehand is a great accomplishment

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Java GUI, basic HTML and CSS, how to not reinvent the wheel, and get things done
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for It's so Sympoh
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clean up the code and fully understand what we took from various libraries, clean up the GUI to make it look nice, and completely rehaul the video player system to support features like BPM matching and Video transposing.
