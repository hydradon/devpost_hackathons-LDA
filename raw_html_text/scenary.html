                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came into this hackathon with a mutual passion in augmented reality. We agreed that we would like to experiment with the technology, and set a goal to create an app that we enjoy making.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    scenARy allows a user to construct a miniature digital forest in their own environment through an iOS or Android device.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a project in Unity and downloaded the ARFoundation, ARKit, and ARCore plugins. These plugins were what enabled us to create an augmented reality application which could be used on both iOS and Android devices.  We were assisted through a few online tutorials, and we also benefitted greatly from two talks that John Ball gave on Unity and Mobile AR development during the event. The 3D models that we used were from the Unity Asset Store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Early in the hackathon, we decided to use React-Native to accomplish our goal, but discovered after a bit of research and exploration that Unity would serve us better. That being said, we had never used Unity before, so we were challenged to build our knowledge of said tool from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had experience developing AR applications, and we are proud with the final result of our weekend. Additionally, it was Henry's first hackathon and one of his first times developing a project outside of school. We are both pleasantly surprised with our work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Unity, C#, and iOS and Android development. We learned a great deal about AR development, such as how plane detection works, and the potential of handheld devices for AR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for scenARy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this hackathon, we stuck to a forest theme that has just 4 unique models. We could easily improve upon this by changing themes, or including more unique models to enhance user experience. Additionally, our app is pretty flexible in purpose and can serve as a foundation for future applications in augmented reality.
