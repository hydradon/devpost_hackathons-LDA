                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to see a more fit and functional society. Also we are one of the youngest contestants here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It encourages people to eat better by offering rewards at their local health food stores.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript and the google maps api for our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Early sign up process and finding local health food stores that would be willing to offer rewards to our app users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked together to produce something we hope that can change the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That app making is a little confusing and more about website building as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FutureFitness
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to get more users and to also add more local health food stores to our app.
