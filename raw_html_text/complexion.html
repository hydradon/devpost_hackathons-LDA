                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People typically purchase clothes, especially bathing suits and makeup, that compliment their skin tone to make colors "pop". We want to provide product suggestions based off of users' fashion preferences and natural attributes to adhere to this theme, making it easier to find that perfect top or pair of shoes.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users create profiles that track their preferences for different types of clothing and makeup. They can provide this information via uploading photos of themselves in outfits that they like or by manually selecting tags. Then, users activate our chrome browser extension when shopping online and Complexion scans each webpage that the user visits for potential matches. If Complexion finds a good match, the product is displayed at the top of the webpage and users are given the option to view more information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrated 8base's platform to abstract certain backend functionality like setting up a database, making it easier to determine how to store data. We incorporated the React framework and tied the frontend into the 8base platform. The web app is solely used for management of user profiles, such as detailing what clothing the user prefers. The chrome extension is the other main component of our product, which is composed of JavaScript code that scrapes the webpage that the user is currently on to find products to match user preferences against.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a neural net with Tensorflow was complicated as was some aspects of integrating the 8base platform.
