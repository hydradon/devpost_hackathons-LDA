                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the free Easybox cubes that one of the sponsors were handing out and decided to make an interactive website dedicated to him.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can say various things (either "hi"/"hello", "you suck!"/"you suck"/"YOU SUCK" or "happy birthday") to Cubey. While he's in his default state, he can jump by pressing the up arrow key. You can also click and drag the food images to his face to feed him.
