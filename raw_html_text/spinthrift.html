                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Shopping isn't fun anymore.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Autobidding software is ruining eBay: scripts hosted on blazing-fast internet connections click 'bid' at the last moment, faster than a human possibly could. That's no fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Penny auction sites are confusing: they often use 'bids' as a middleman currency, and have all sorts of restrictions. They offer very little transparency, and their inventory is limited to cheap items. That's no fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the above eCommerce platforms also have a fundamental flaw, from the user's perspective: bidding on an item effectively raises its cost. This can be abused by vendors. That's no fun!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how can we #MakeShoppingFunAgain?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Enter Spinthrift.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The elevator pitch says it best.
                    <strong>
                        Pay 10% of the cost of an item for a 10% chance of winning it.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To elaborate a bit: multiple slots can be purchased by the same user. Once all ten slots have been purchased, the Spinwheel selects a winner at random. If no slots have been purchased by anyone yet, the  'Buy it Now' feature is available for the item.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Lots and lots of RAMEN!
                    </strong>
                    No, not the noodle-turned-programmer-fuel. I'm talking about my favorite web stack, the main components of which are React, Alt, MongoDB, Express, and Node. React is Facebook's brilliant view layer framework, and Alt is a kickass implementation of Facebook's Flux paradigm, courtesy of Airbnb's goatslacker. The analogy far from perfect, but React is the 'V' in 'MVC', while Alt covers the 'M' and 'C'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've spiced up my RAMEN: it features universal (previously isomorphic) Javascript for improved initial page load, SEO, and support for browsers with Javascript disabled. I also use a custom view-layer navigation and page loading system to automatically handle authentication/authorization, as well as to ensure the data needed by the view layer has been retrieved and properly parsed for rendering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        On the backend, I've prioritized security and scalability.
                    </strong>
                    Sanitizing sensitive ObjectIds and rolling my own custom schema/model middleware for the Spinthrift API has enabled fine-grained control over (and tracking/analysis of) data transactions and security events.
                </p>

                        Confession:
                    </strong>
                    I did something I shouldn't have, in the name of learning! I rolled my own salting and hashing, as well as my own session middleware augmented by Passport.js. To all you CTOs out there, I'm sowwy. ^_^

                    None of this would have happened without my sensei, Daniel-San, who I first encountered on a rock in the middle of the Pacific. He remains a valuable source of wisdom and entertaining texts. I cannot overstate the importance of the latter.
