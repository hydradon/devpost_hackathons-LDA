                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was interested in helping people learn English as a few people on our team were not native English speakers and was intrigued by learning how to use speech recognition.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes voice input and tells you if your pronunciation is correct. There is also a dictionary function to define words.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Android development to make an Android app with Java and XML.

                    Did not know how to make Android apps before coming to HackDuke. Had to learn everything as we needed to create it.
