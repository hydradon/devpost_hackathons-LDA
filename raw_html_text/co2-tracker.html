                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You hear a lot in the media about how bad our emissions are but it's never directly connected to you. Our project takes your data and gives you a personal connection to the impact you have on the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After uploading your Google Location-History file, the user chooses their car, and it produces a graph visualizing their last 30 days of emissions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with CO2 emission statistics from fueleconomy.gov and put them into MongoDB, then we started working on the front end using React. We built the site to input a file and parsed the valuable information from that file. Using the data from MongoDB we created a three stage drop-down menu for the user to input their car information. Finally we took that information and displayed it in a graph.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    Working with large data-sets, staying organized as a group and many more small challenges (Refer to my Google search history throughout the past 24h).
                </p>
