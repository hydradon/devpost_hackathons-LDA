                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being high schoolers who were just recently exposed to the blockchain world, we were curious as to how blockchains and smart contracts could be used in an app. To satisfy our curiosities, we decided on an app that allowed users to temporarily rent out parking spots through the transactions of ether.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    dPark aims to allow the rental of parking space with the payment of ether.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    dPark's website was built in html, css, javascript (node.js) and used packages such as truffle and ganache to modify and manipulate our smart contracts made in solidity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, wallets are viewed using metamask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being completely new to blockchain, we had to learn a whole new environment of development. This included learning new concepts such as smart contracts and decentralization and new languages/packages such as solidity and truffle. This throttled our working speed as we often got confused at what blockchain developers probably would have done in 2 seconds.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were at least able to make a satisfying website frontend for our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the basics of blockchain development and how dApps are made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for dPark
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we plan to create a working backend for our app and to properly utilize smart contracts into our service.
