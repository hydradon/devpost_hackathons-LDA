                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted an app that most people could find useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads instructions for you while you cook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Nuance Nina API and Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the Nina API was a bit challenging at first.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Learning how to integrate the Nina API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use the Nuance Nina API and how we would eventually use it to power our final Nuanced Cooking app.

                    What's next for Nuanced Cooking
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Full core functionality, and later inputting recipes via OCR and potentially user sharing of recipes through the app.
