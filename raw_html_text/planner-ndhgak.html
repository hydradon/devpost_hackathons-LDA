                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we have both gone through many to do list apps or organizers. However, none of these apps were able to schedule tasks into google calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add tasks to your to do list (name, description, due date, approx how long it will take to complete) and they will be scheduled into google calendar during homework times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and JS. Using firebase we are able to store each users' tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to find empty slots on a user's calendar to create an event in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having most of the to do list functionalities working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Calendar API and Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    Better calendar scheduling.
