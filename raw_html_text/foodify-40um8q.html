                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yesterday I found $30 worth of good food expired because my roomates and I didn't pay attention to their life span. This hasn't been the first time and I'm certain other university students share my pain

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeps track of your food (particularly fruits and vegetables) by telling you when the food will expire and how long you have upon purchase to save it for
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Clarifai API, I managed to use the camera to take photos of groceries. Thus, I can search up expiry dates of foods more easily than typing in.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on making a web platform for people to exchange almost expired foods. This will reduce waste and give people what they want (sellers get a partial refund and buyers get a great discount)!
