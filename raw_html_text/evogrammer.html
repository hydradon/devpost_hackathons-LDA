                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I thought it would be cool to get a code to write code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It randomly generates
                    <strong>
                        code
                    </strong>
                    in a custom language I created and evolves the code using natural selection so that it solves a given specific problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have used a
                    <strong>
                        Genetic Algorithm
                    </strong>
                    to iterate over generations of code and a
                    <strong>
                        Squared Error Loss Function
                    </strong>
                    to choose the
                    <strong>
                        survivor
                    </strong>
                    of each generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code is like DNA. It is a sequence of operations, aka
                    <strong>
                        genes
                    </strong>
                    . Each gene consist of 3
                    <strong>
                        bases
                    </strong>
                    . They are for
                    <strong>
                        Operation
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        Input
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Assignment
                    </strong>
                    accordingly. An Operation is a character between '0' and '6':
0 -&gt; assign
1 -&gt; add
2 -&gt; subtract
3 -&gt; multiply
4 -&gt; divide
5 -&gt; root
6 -&gt; power
                </p>
                <p>
                    An Input is either a character between '0' and '9', representing literal integer value, or a character between 'A' and 'F', representing variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An Assignment is a character between 'A' and 'F' representing variables.
'A' is initialized with the input and 'B' is where the output is read from.
Every variable besides 'A' is initialized with 0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's an example code that solves f(x)=x*x-1:
                </p>
                <p>
                    3AA 1AB 21B
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Multiply A(input) by itself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add A to B.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Subtract 1 from B
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    An Interesting Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If a go-to operation was to be included, it would be a turing-complete language which means that this program could solve computer science problems given enough time and supervised data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I actually tried implementing this but it did not give very good results since making if's or for's out of go-to statements require a perfect coherence between several independent parts of the code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if it seems like hard task, I can't see any reason why there shouldn't be a solution to this.
