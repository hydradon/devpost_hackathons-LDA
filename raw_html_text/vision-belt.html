                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the theme of assistive technology we believed that designing the smart belt would give us the opportunity to apply our knowledge of computer hardware, while also tying in a software aspect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So what is the smart belt? The smart belt is a belt that tracks if there is an object that is too close to someone who is visually impaired and could be a safety hazard. When an object is too close the belt beeps and vibrates on one of three sensors. The sensor that beeps and vibrates is based on where the object is.  If the object is on the left side of the belt, the left sensor will beep. This indicates to the visually impaired person that the object that could be a safety hazard is on the left side of their body.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How  we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So how was the smart belt made? The smart belt was made using React Native to make the app, that the emergency contact would be reached by if the person who was blind was lost. Through a Bluetooth module, the React Native App connects to the Arduino. The Arduino has ultrasonic sensors, which we programmed to vibrate if someone or some object is 50 or less cm away. When the emergency button is clicked on the smart belt, a push notification is sent to the emergency contact.

                <p>
                    -React Native is a high-level programming language that was hard for us to use, but it was rewarding when we got our app to work.
