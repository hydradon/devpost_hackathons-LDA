                    Humans are always busy. Humans are also always wearing clothes (at least in public). However, with deadlines, stress, and overwhelming quantities of apparel being purchased on a day-to-day basis, we tend to forget about the little things. We forget about the clothing in our drawers. We miss out on awesome sales on must-buy jeans. Or worse! We fail to have the latest trending clothing in our closets. This problematically causes us to spend money on repeat/unnecessary clothing purchases, or clothes that do not coordinate with our existing outfits. Luckily, Dressr provides an innovative and convenient approach to such problems.

                    Dressr is a mobile and web application that allows users to organize their closets on digital platforms. With the click of a button and a few swipes, individuals can take photos of their clothes, wishlist items, and on-going purchases such that they can coordinate their outfits and make smart and informed spending decisions.

                    We are absolutely thrilled to be introducing our project and the problems it addresses (no pun intended!).
