                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all found a common problem with having many tabs open during development. This made it difficult to find, manage, and close tabs. We wanted better tab management and that lead us to building this extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It dynamically groups tabs together by same domain names. It also allows for these grouped tabs to be closed easily all at once. We also allow users to manually control whether the extension is on/off as well as manually sort tabs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML,CSS,Javascript. We made use of the chrome API in order to manipulate tabs and extension pop-ups. We used Git &amp; Github to manage tasks between group members efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had previously worked with Javascript nor an extension on any browser. We faced some problems with event handling for some html components. We also faced challenges with asynchronous querying function calls in the chrome API. We had some difficulties merging git at first as most group members were new to Git &amp; Github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We achieved a product that we're actually willing and going to use as well as maintain in the future. Specifically, we all liked the dynamic sorting of the tabs as it made navigating through tabs easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Chrome API,extension creation, html/css/javascript, git, and github. We learned how to organize tasks and communicate ideas throughout our group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BetterTabs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We look to improve on our code optimization, port to Firefox, and add functionality that we planned to integrate, but we were unable to due to time constraints.
