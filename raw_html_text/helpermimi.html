                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To create a bot that can help with decisions.

                <p>
                    HelperMiMi is a bot that helps indecisive people work their decisions and avoid unnecessary stress. A series of questions will be presented before a random decision making game plays. Left can represent a certain choice while right can be the the other choice. Whichever one the ball falls into, the choice will be made.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using CodeSkulptor and amateur knowledge of Python. We both left early due to an emergency and through knowledge of interactive python from Coursera, we came up with such a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working out the dialogue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game was created to aid the mental disorder Aboulomania in which the patient displays pathological indecisiveness. It is typically associated with anxiety, stress, and mental anguish, and can severely affect one's ability in the society.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we didn&rsquo;t know how to make an interactive module. We found out after some googling. Finding out there exists such a disorder like Aboulomania was also through this experience!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HelperMiMi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow more input of choices. We don&rsquo;t think HelperMiMi is &lsquo;interactive&rsquo; enough with the player. The responses pretty much stand regardless of how the player answers. An improvement could be say for example, when HelperMiMi asked &ldquo;You are currently mulling over the best course of action, yes?&rdquo; - if answered &ldquo;no,&rdquo; the dialogue should stop.
