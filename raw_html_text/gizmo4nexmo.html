                    Inspiration

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First api nexmo short code will send alert message to disaster team with a sourceforge app gizmo4. This will inform receiver of type of incoming data and emergency issued.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the nexmo platform for short code messaging. 5 day wait for this short code approval frpm Nexmo.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a difficult to create the api interfaces. I found the shortcode to message the respondents of incoming emergency. Need the Nexmo authorization. Once these apis are integrated this will be a powerful tool to acuratly receive text sms and voice over one nexmo number
