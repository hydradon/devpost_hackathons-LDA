                    JumpStart is a web service which aims at connecting people through social good. 
It may happen that a person has a car breakdown in the middle of nowhere, and is unable to reach the towing service. It is in this scenario that JumpStart comes in. It allows the aforementioned person to send out a request on the website, which will then send the request by mail to people who are in the vicinity. We are thus connecting people by allowing them to assist others in need.

                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop web pages using html and Java Script. We also learned to implement Google Cloud Services, and store data using Firebase.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    For the back end, we used Java Script and Python. We implemented the Google Sign In API to authorize the usage of the web service. We also implemented the Google Maps API to allow location tracking. For the front end, we used html to design the pages.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We were unable to successfully link the front and back end completely, which resulted in the web service not working at its full efficiency. We also faced difficulties in correctly implementing the Google APIs, which however we were successful in doing. We also faced a lot of difficulty with Node.js as we were all unfamiliar with it. It took long, but we were able to overcome this in time.
