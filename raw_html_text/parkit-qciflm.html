                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With almost missing my math final last year, we decided that we needed to solve the parking issue. Finding a parking spot is nearly impossible and time consuming. Even self driving cars have to go through all lanes of a parking lot to finally find a spot. With our mobile app, we can help humans and self driving cars find a parking spot with ease.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using map data, we were able to detect cars in a parking lot and associate each car with a Google Maps coordinate to show drivers available parking spots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using our very own machine learning algorithm, we trained a haar-cascade classifier that distinguishes cars in a parking lot from empty spots. Using OpenCV(computer vision) and Python we associated each detected car with a Google Maps coordinate. The coordinates are sent to our Amazon Web Server where the Javascript files overlay red or green rectangles onto our parking lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our machine learning algorithm would crashed several times before finally being trained. Our laptop was not able to handle the large dataset of car images(2000+). After several tries of allocating maximum memory, we were able to detect all cars with a accuracy of 84%.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ParkIt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate our solution with self driving cars and car companies such as Uber. Self driving cars are able to enter a parking lot but they must search through all rows before finally finding a parking spot wasting time and fuel.
