                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to meet the challenges that our sponsors have given us and make a game out of it. We thought of giving smart challenges to the population to bring the community closer by breaking down the language barrier and better the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application will give users a daily challenge that touches a variety of topics: going from the environment challenges such as "Pick up litter on the street" to community involvement such as "Make someone happy" to helping people struggling with languages in the "Talk to someone in French" challenge. We wanted to bring the community together and increase awareness of their environment by the means of this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've used Android studio in order to build the application. We separated the tasks according to our strength. We set up a firebase database to store the multiple challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some Android Studio problems as well as Firebase learning difficulties (Using Firebase in Android studio). The relativeLayout in the android studio was not working properly, so we decided to change to constraintLayout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fixing the bugs and getting the program up and running is one of our proudest accomplishments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work in a team as well as new knowledge on Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeActe:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Set up profiles for the users so they can keep track of their accomplished challenges and send challenges to their peers.
Get the Government of Canada involved by suggesting and deploying to newcomers, and help further improve the application.
Create wider events to bring volunteers together to take care of the environment and the community.
