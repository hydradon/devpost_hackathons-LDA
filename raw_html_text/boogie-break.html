                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to design a program that would give people the chance, and a reminder, to get up and move while they're at their computer for an extended period of time. This program is designed to add fun and useful breaks into peoples' everyday lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Boogie Break is a web extension designed to improve the health, productivity, and stress level of its users. Every thirty minutes the user is in Google Chrome, Boogie Break will notify the user that they have been inactive for an extended period of time and direct them to a fun song or short (roughly five minute) youtube exercise video in a category of their choosing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created it using javascript functions, which complemented html pages. These work together, with the help of a .json script, to give functionality to the chrome extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges implementing our html and javascript in the Google Chrome environment. There was a lot of debugging of permissions and linking between files that needed to be ironed out to have our extension run smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our ability to start from scratch and learn how to create a Chrome extension in 24 hours -- especially since this is our first hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned, and furthered our understanding of, javascript, html, css, and json programming. Only one of the three team members had experience in this field, so teamwork was very important!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Boogie Break
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Future iterations of Boogie Break could feature a more developed user interface, additional options for wait time between reminder messages, and more options for type of exercise.
