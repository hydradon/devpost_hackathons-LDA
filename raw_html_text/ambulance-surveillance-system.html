                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ambulances often get stuck in traffic wasting valuable time. Our app hopes to save these valuable seconds, because in health, every second counts!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When an ambulance passes through halfway through an intersection, a sensor detects it and changes the signal in a matter of seconds. This allows the ambulance to pass through easily.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a model in mind, we placed sensors half way through intersections. As soon as the sensor detects the ambulance pass through, the emergency system gets activated, changing all the signals in a matter of seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenge we ran into was switching between the normal system and the emergency system. Also, the synchronization between signals would break very often, which was another important challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make each signal independent by not using delay's in our code. Delays do not detect an ambulance pass through the sensor, hence, we built a different clock for the signals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From this project we learned a lot about arduino's in general. Being our first ever hardware hack, we were able to achieve a lot in these 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ambulance Surveillance System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is supposed to be a practical system meant for real life. In the real life, we would use google API's to track ambulances. Also, we will connect each traffic signal to a system which would be able to switch on a wireless system.
