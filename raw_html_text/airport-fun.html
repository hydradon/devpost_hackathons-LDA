                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spend a lot of time traveling, and with that comes a lot of time in the airport. I wanted to create some fun simple games to keep people entertained while they are at the airport. I also wanted to put in as much information I could to make the app more of a one stop shop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It includes 5 fun games to keep you entertained at the airport. 3 scavenger hunts, where you go around the airport taking pictures of items and meeting people. As well as 2 games where you collect airports and countries you travel in, which keep people coming back to the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also wanted to make the app useful for anyone, and thought about challenges I had faced, since I travel so much. I want to find the easiest way to get the airport, so I added the rome2rio API. I wanted airports maps, so added in a number of those. I was always after suggestions on what to do, especially on long layovers. And I wanted to find particular places to eat and drink, when I have never been to that airport before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it in 2 weeks using Objective-C and Xcode.
I created a web backend in PHP and myself to save the scores of the people playing the games.
I use the rome2rio API for getting information on how to get to the airport. -

                        https://www.rome2rio.com/documentation/search
                    </a>
                    I used the xapix.io API to get information about all the airports, and find the nearest airport to the user using their GPS location.
I used the YELP library I created in another hackathon (
                    <a href="https://devpost.com/software/yelp-bubbles" rel="nofollow">
                        https://devpost.com/software/yelp-bubbles
                    </a>
                    ) to provide details about restaurants, bars, hotels and other when you are in the airport.
I used another API to get airports maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard getting xapix to work at first, with it timing out on me. I also found it hard to get airport info. And when I found all the airport APIs, it was hard to match the data to a proper airport, since they used different names and didn't always include airport code (LAX - Los Angeles airport, LA airport, etc...)
Testing the app was hard as well, since traveling to different airports isn't possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it all working and in the app store before the deadline.
Coming up with a fun game, and actually getting it working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That dealing with APIs can be tricky, so start off with that. When you need to reach out to someone for help, they are often in different timezones, and don't enjoy working on the weekend :).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Airport Fun
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is already available on the app store for free right now! I have a new release with a lot of new features waiting to go out as well. I want to add more features, scores, challenging others and more. I also want to create a library for other to use the games I created in their own apps.
