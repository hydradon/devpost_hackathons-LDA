                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using various technologies and taking to heart the advice from a Pediatric Psychologist from Shands Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Dr. Rao, our team has built a project aiming to be able to help kids deal with and overcome their fear of surgery. Our Virtual Reality Experience, built for the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR, is a virtual representation of a hospital (based on Shands Hospital) that includes the pre-operation and operation rooms, along with the child&rsquo;s transitioning between the two. These rooms include all of the people a child would encounter before, during, and after surgery, including nurses, technicians, surgeons, and an anesthesiologist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Surgery can induce severe anxiety in children, which according to the National Center for Biotechnology Research,
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        &ldquo;Severe anxiety can cause unpleasant symptoms and stress. Typical symptoms include a pounding heart, a racing heart (fast pulse), irregular heartbeat, nausea, a nervous stomach, shortness of breath and sleep problems. These anxiety-related symptoms can be particularly worrying for people who have pain due to a heart condition. Anxiety can make pain worse, as well as making it harder to cope with the pain.&rdquo;
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Rao noted that as a child gets more nervous and shows the above problems, more anesthetic is needed for the child during the surgery and more pain medication is needed after, which is something that should be aimed to be avoided if possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our VR program allows for the child to be able to get a representation of what they are about to experience. This would allow them to ask their nurse questions about the equipment that is in the room and also allows them to know the identities of all the hospital staff that will help them throughout the process. This also gives the nurses&rsquo; and all those that work with the patients an easier time with their job, as they don&rsquo;t have to worry about calming or even restraining the patients. 
According to various studies, including those by K Bekelis et. al, J Gold et. al, V Leibovici et. al and all of the other studies in our references, VR has high potential in reducing stress and could prevent trauma from the experience.

                        Not to use Oculus anymore when working on this type of project as it implements OpenVR standards poorly compared to HTC Vive. It is also difficult to initiate proprietary software. It has Poor driver support: required many re-installs of both driver software and proprietary software.
