                    Data analysis can help in taking the right decisions. For sponsors, it is not always clear which footballers provide the most value per cost. By looking systematically at performance and popularity data, this process can be supported and great value can be generated.

                    We gather data from social media and statistics sites and present it in a clear manner.

                    How we built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used regex to parse html and javascript.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cambridge Analytica as well as paywalls made scraping data from the internet very difficult. Also, we didn't have a front end developer, so we focused more on scraping data.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We need a front end developer, more sleep and better domain knowledge.
