                    After putting in a valiant effort to learn and write an iOS app with Swift with absolutely no prior knowledge, our team decided that with 12 hours left that there would be absolutely no way for our team to complete our app. We contemplated different options including Unity but we finally came up with the idea for a HTML5/JS game. As the time was running out, our team came together to produce our final product: Treeland
