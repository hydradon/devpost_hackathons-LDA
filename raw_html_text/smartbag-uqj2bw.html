                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doing food deliveries, one of us came up with the idea of having a device alert the rider whenever some Ramen (or whatever else) leaks inside the backpack. From there on we tried to add features and came up with some different ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Main goal: help rider avoid ruining the payload
Features:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        leakage alarm: if the rider knows when something starts leaking it gets much easier to avoid ruined orders the customer won't accept
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        open bag alarm: simply to check whether the bag is open - this was not designed for delivery riders, but normal backpacks
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        temperature monitoring for the food: in the winter sometimes riders opt to use a smaller bag to further insulate the food, keeping it warm. This lets them know when it is worth doing so
This entire mechanism is toggled on/off via bluetooth on a smartphone with the Nordic Semi nRF app.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connectivity issues
Documentation issues for Bluetooth low energy boards
Debugging bad jumper wires in the circuits
Libraries with weird behaviours
Bluetooth directly on Rasp Pi
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with a blueprint for a solution that would actually be extremely useful in the real-world, once correctly polished.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Accelerometer and gyroscope to let the rider know if he is destroying the client's pizza (believe me, it's easy to forget and kind of ruin it all) - this was our second idea, but unfortunately there was no such sensor available
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        IR module was supposed to be used for alerting the rider of an incoming car from behind, however this would need a very powerful and long range module (transmitter+receiver)
