                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People tend to want to listen to songs that match their current mood, and we wanted to make it easier for people to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app basically gives you the option of uploading a picture, detects the mood and gives the user a Spotify playlist based on their mood
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Microsoft Azure facial recognition API and Spotify API and integrated them on a basic website using 'glitch' platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using these APIs for the first time, creating a secure connection to spotify accounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working prototype
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use an API, glitch and a better understanding of Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PlayMyMood
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the UX design and better algorithm for song emotion and algorithm that relies on rating system to measure our performance. For the future of this project, we intend to make it possible for users to be able to Login using their spotify details, which could help us manipulate their personal playlist based on their mood too
