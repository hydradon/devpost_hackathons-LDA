                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to create a simple, calm, and relaxing game, perfect for casual play while hanging out with friends or unwinding from the pressures of student life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zentropy is a virtual zen rock garden where the player can move rocks around using the mouse. If the rocks are placed in the proper configuration they will begin to glow with a relaxing aura.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created all the pixel art in Photoshop, and built the game with Clickteam Fusion 2.5. The whole project was done in about 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent a lot of time trying to make everything look aesthetically beautiful, and barely had time to test the game! There are a lot more parts of the design still waiting to be added, but for a 1 day project I am very pleased with the results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love the look of the rocks, and there is some simple logic/puzzle action to making the 3 smallest ones glow... Also there are some nice ambient particles which add some life and motion to the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned it is good to play to your strengths, especially when working on an individual project. I chose to go for visual beauty over logical complexity, and I think that was a solid move. Also I learned that it is best to get started right away when competing in a hackathon, and not spend hours doing paper design!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Zentropy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created 11 different rock objects, each with its own simple logic. So far I have only implemented the zen aura for 3 of the rocks, so at some point I will plan to go back and code the rest of them. I would also like to add multiple difficulty settings, and some nice ambient sounds/music.
