                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone does amazon shopping from time to time. And people always want to get the best deal. The price on amazon.com fluctuates a lot, and there is usually limited inventory. Therefore, we write some simple scrips helping tracking prices on amazon.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user is able to input multiple amazon product URLs for tracking. For each product, the user will input the desired price. When the price drops to the desired range of the user, the user will receive an email indicating a certain product's price drops and it's time to buy. 
The scripts will monitor multiple products' prices all at once and once a certain product reaches the desired price, it will be removed from the list.
We have a work in progress GUI which still needs a lot of work and we are not able to finish it before the hackathon ends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use python to write the script utilizing beautiful soup as the web scrapping tool. The smtplib library is used to send the email. 
There is a tracker class where we have all functions need for getting the URLs, desired prices from the user as well as checking the price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all beginner programmers and it is our first time putting up together a working prototype of an application (actually a small part of it). We never learned any sort of GUI design and we learned everything on site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we mentioned, it is our first time actually writing codes for real-life use and it kind of works. We learned a lot of new knowledge during the short 3 days and we are very proud of ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use GitHub for collaboration, new tricks about web scrapping as well as GUI design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Amazon Price Tracker
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Right now the script can only read in specific URLs. We would like it to read in the product name and find the page itself.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The script should run on a remote server instead of running on the clients' devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The GUI is still work in progress and needs to be finished.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The script ignores coupons on amazon pages and this can be improved
                    </li>
                </ol>
