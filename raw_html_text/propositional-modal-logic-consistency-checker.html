                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used to study philosophy, in particular the metaphysics and semantics of modal claims (claims about possibility and necessity).  People often had trouble wrapping their heads around arguments involving modal operators.  This resource can help people quickly interpret modal arguments.  If optimized, it could allow AIs to reason about possibilities (a metaphysical notion), distinct from probabilities (an epistemic notion).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a set of formal sentences and tells you whether they are consistent in S5 Propositional Modal Logic.  The sentences can be inputted by the user or taken from built-in examples.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python.  I used a Tableau method of inference on sets of sentences.  It is mostly done with arrays and string manipulation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Modal operators embedded inside non-modal operators.  Negated modal operators.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing.  Being able to handle every reasonably-sized collection of sentences I've tested.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python is the best!  Some other people like modal logic.  I can stay up throughout the entire night.
                </p>

                    What's next for Propositional Modal Logic Consistency Checker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GUI. Opening testing to philosophers and computer scientists.  Adding options to check for argument validity, logical truth, and contradiction.
