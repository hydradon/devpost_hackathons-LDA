                    ConnectThem allows people to play a simple strategy game against one another, regardless of what platform they are on.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server is built with Java and is hosted by Microsoft Azure. Both the PC client and the Android app were built with Java and CSS.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a lot of challenges trying to communicate over a busy network. I was unable to find a team to work with, and coincidentally faced a lot of pressure to meet milestones in time. I also faced a last minute challenge trying to multi-thread my server when I moved it to Azure, but was able to successfully adapt it. I was able to produce a decent looking GUI for the PC client and a functioning one for Android. Well I didn't have time to write clients fro WIndows Phone and iPhone before submission, I would love to finish them for the GitHub Repo to show the proof of concept.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My biggest goal in this project was to learn more about network programming and implement it into my project. I was successful in doing that. I learned a lot about TCP data transfers, Azure, and moving a physical server to the cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about TCP data transfers, Azure, and moving a physical server to the cloud. This was my first hackathon, so I also learned a lot about how hackathons work and what better strategies will be for next time.

                    What's next for ConnectThem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would really like to finish the mobile clients (iOS, Android, Windows) for this project to fully demonstrate its capabilities. I also had a great game twist in mind but thought of it too late and didn't have time to implement it, but would love to add it in the future.
