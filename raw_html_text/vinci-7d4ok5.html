                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hear about amazing sales and hidden-gem shops by word of mouth, but how often is it accurate? You would have to go to the location to see for yourself, however with Vinci, we bring that information to you. Vinci achieves various goals, suited for different purposes including helping reduce wait times by warning people of spots with heavy traffic, influencing local commerce, find more businesses that suit a consumer's intended needs and to help even out the local market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vinci shows a user the surrounding businesses and the traffic at each business, by tracking the number of transactions happen at the businesses each hour.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built in Android Studios using JavaScript while the Google Maps API and TD Da Vinci API allowed us to use a map and plot a gradient map on top of it using real-time consumer transaction data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    API callbacks, a depreciated API, the scalability, expensive computations and the fact that large amounts of memory are needed for calculations are a few of the challenges that ultimately inhibited our final product from being fully functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very proud to have been able to nice map appear in our app and for coming up with the data visualization concept as well as the new knowledge we gained from trying to implement it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the things we learned was that Axios provides promises for asynchronous JavaScript functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vinci
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would train a machine learning model to be able to predict how busy businesses would be busy beforehand to give consumers the ability to plan ahead more accurately when shopping.
