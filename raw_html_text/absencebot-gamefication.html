                    The idea behind our project is to use Gamefication on top of AbsenceBot and so that increase personal and also company commitments using a fun approach.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AbsenceBot is an internal KI labs tool, already in production, that facilitates its Employees to register Absence events. So based on its logs, we decide to create "milestones" that once reached can "unlock" Badges. This feature offers different levels of challenges, so it does not only requires individual, but also some team-level efforts to get all of them unlocked.
                </p>
