                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students passionate about our own financial wellness, it seemed like a perfect idea to try and share the knowledge of the crucial basics of being financially literate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We all have peers and relatives who struggle, or have struggled with money in the past.
The hope is that we will be able to prevent some of that struggle by educating others about taking control of their financial situation in easy ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app serves as a course type website, which offers small and easily digestible lessons on topics such as credit, taxes, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While most of this educational content is not necessarily filled out yet, the framework we built allows us to very easily add an entire course with simple JSON objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react.js with node.js, using Google's firebase for authentication and database storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we did not have this project pre-planned, we had to spend a lot of start-up time planning the architecture and learning the technology, as most of us had not used react.js in depth before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bugs took a long time to solve, as there is less overall documentation for a newer technology like react.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we ran into vision and communication issues as to which ideas should be implemented and in what way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned react! In addition, we were able to create a well-built skeleton which could easily be built upon in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    REACT! 
We also learned that coming in with a pre-planned idea would have been a huge help in terms of actually getting to write a lot of the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Financial Literacy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since some of the core functionality is not yet complete, that would be the next step for Financial Literacy as an educational proof of concept. Some of this functionality includes catering to a user's specific financial situation, adding more educational courses, and further polishing the current educational process.
