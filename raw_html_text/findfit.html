                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to take up Hillman's challenge. We thought it would be a fun project to tackle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a picture of a hand and determines what size of gloves would fit that specific hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a neural network that analyzes specific points on the hand and maps that to real world coordinates. It then determines the size of the hand and compares that to the specifications for different glove sizes. It uses that to produce the glove recommendation. After, a web application displays the data that is gathered in a nice GUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of never having met before, and we all liked to work with different languages/frameworks. That created some difficulty in determining what technologies to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to work as a team and bring our different ideas together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should do more research into frameworks and ideas before getting started.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FindFit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, it will be implemented in stores to help people find the right pair of gloves, but it could also be expanded. Additionally, it could be used for other clothes like shirts and pants.
