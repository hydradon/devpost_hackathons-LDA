                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to have the computer make memes for us, but finding/coming up with enough similar memes to parse was pretty hard, so we looked to the next best things: haikus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates haikus after analyzing a text document of your choice. Sometimes you'll get heartfelt poetry, sometimes you'll get... something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a state machine in C# based on Markov chains to parse through 30+ pages of highly praised poetry and create some haikus of our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a stable algorithm to make the state machine make sense
Having a large enough sample size of words
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding an API that counts word syllables, thereby making the haiku format possible
Using an API for the first time
Actually having variance in the poems generated
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APIs are super useful
We can never be quite sure what to expect of the generated haikus
Hackathons are fun :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hit-or-miss Haikus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More complicated poem structures, such as sonnets
Using an image query to pull up relevant images as possible backgrounds
                </p>
