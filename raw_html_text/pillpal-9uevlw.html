                    Clinical Background
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy in combating chronic illnesses, it is estimated that 50% of patients are nonadherent to their medications. Medication nonadherence leads to increased patient morbidity and costs $300 billion annually in U.S. healthcare expenditures. This is particularly prevalent in coronary artery disease (CAD), where nonadherence to prescriptions is as high as 80% and has been strongly linked with poor health outcomes and unnecessary medical costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After conducting over 300 stakeholder interviews, we learned that common causes for non-adherence include lack of motivation, fear of side effects, and an overwhelming opinion that taking pills is an unenjoyable chore. The team also learned that many older patients are commonly lonely and often welcome the opportunity to interact with others, especially their loved ones. These findings were confirmed by the World Health Organization, which found that social support has consistently been reported to improve medication adherence in chronic conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, verification of proper patient usage of prescribed medications is important for clinicians to assess whether the treatment is working. In most outpatient settings, clinicians rely upon the patient&rsquo;s self-report. However, multiple studies have shown that this is not reliable, as patients do not recall 40-80% of relevant medical information and they generally overreport adherence to please the clinician. This potentially leads to medication errors, such as overprescription and dosing errors, which not only compounds medical costs but also compromises treatment efficacy by increasing the risk of harmful drug interactions and adverse side effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, there is no way to motivate patients to take their medications, while also accurately verifying appropriate medication adherence to clinicians. In doing so, we can potentially improve patient health outcomes and decrease health care spending by a tremendous amount.
                </p>

                    What We Built: PillPal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team has developed PillPal, a social-networking app designed to improve medication adherence through coordinating medication administration among different users. It uses video communication technology to motivate patients to take their medications by fostering interaction with supporting family members, friends, or other patients with similarly scheduled medication regimens. Accompanying the app is a web-portal that allows patients and clinicians to visualize adherence patterns, and allow them to engage in better-informed conversations at the time of clinic appointments.
