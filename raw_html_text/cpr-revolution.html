                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project comes from the importance of the average citizen being trained in CPR to some extent. CPR can often triple the chances of survival in the case of a sudden cardiac arrest outside a hospital. This game aims to help people get used to the correct rhythm for CPR, which would allow them to perform it better if a situation arose.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game sends sprites across the screen at a certain speed. When the sprite reaches the box in the middle, the player must press the space bar. If the game is played correctly, the player will be pressing the space bar at a tempo of 100bpm, the beats per minute required for chest compressions in CPR.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was built in Unity, using C# scripts to perform actions such as checking whether or not the space bar had been pressed at the right time. Pixl Art was used to create the sprites.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge out of the gate was the fact that none of the team had any prior experience of Unity or C#. Hence, the team had to follow tutorials to gain an understanding of the workings of Unity before even starting to code the game itself. This learning process took place under time pressure, due to the Hackathon lasting only two days. The score script was a particularly tough one - as this required communication between various other scripts which was tricky to implement. Another big challenge was the lack of medical students in the team - this meant we had to research far more to ensure the accuracy of certain elements of the game.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Delivering a working game on time despite our inexperience with the environment that we were building in was a huge win. Effectively working together to debug issues that appeared to come out of nowhere was a challenging yet rewarding experience.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This weekend was our first experience with Unity and we learnt a good deal about it. From animating sprites to writing and attaching scripts and other components to them, we rapidly expanded our knowledge about the basics of game development.

                    What's next for CPR+Revolution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An additional idea we did not have time to implement was to include the other part of CPR - mouth to mouth ventilation. This would make  focus on watching the rising and falling of the chest to judge the correct interval for breaths. We could also add more modes to the game, perhaps one that questions the player whether or not CPR should be used in the situation.. In the long term, with more time and a budget, it would be a cool idea to build some custom hardware that would judge someone's CPR technique (i.e. a mannequin with sensors) and provide better feedback.
