                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the sustainability challenge to design something useful. We thought representing sustainability in an easily interpreted manner would foster positive improvement for the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It converts data from several public APIs into a "Sustainability Score" which represents how environmentally friendly and forward thinking a city is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using C#'s ASP.NET as the back end to interface with APIs. The homepage is designed through a combination of Javascript and Google Maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first ran into issues with the APIs, both in finding them and in using them. Later, we ran into complications with our Github repository, as we rapidly progressed and learned from our mistakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our implementation of Google Maps is pretty slick. Interfacing with several APIs and handling JSON requests was not easy, but we prevailed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Update the gitignore as soon as you start a project! We learned the importance of responsible teamwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CityScore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On technical level, we would like to include more data/categories contributing to the Sustainability Score and improve availability to locations outside the US. To elevate this application beyond a simple data collection program, we would like to increase its legitimacy by partnering with a business or agency to incentivize its use by local governments.
