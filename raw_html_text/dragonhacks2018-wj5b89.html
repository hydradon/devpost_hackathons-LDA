                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many Asian families use gas stoves with the poor safety equipment, if any. This leads to hundreds of accidental explosions each year, which broadly raises high concern. We developed a gas leakage detection system, ready to hit the household and enterprise market, and we names it LeakBuster. It is a system to detect, identify, and alert the user if it detects any leaked gas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We create LeakBuster with three main components: a household gas detector, an online interface for the authorities, and a drone. The household gas detector uses an MQ-2 sensor to detect Propane, Butane and LPG levels in the environment. If it senses a leakage, a notification is sent to the user's phone and the fire department is immediately informed. A report with the user's details, address and location goes to a central database. Authorities in the Fire Department can access this data from an intuitive web interface, which lets them know active and past (resolved) reports. Also, a map is available which marks all reports, and marks the severity of the issue with different colors.
The last component is the drone, which patrols a fixed path and checks for gas leaks. This drone can be deployed in factories and underground tunnels, in large open areas where the risk of gas leaks is high.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, LeakBuster is a project potentially saving thousands of lives, in the household and the enterprise.
