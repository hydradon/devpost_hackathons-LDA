                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are several programming contest in the world, and some of them accept any programming language. Google Code Jam is one of them and my favorite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attending such a contest using your favorite language helps you to get used to the language. And it is very fun and insightful to see other people's solution in your favorite language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The thing is, currently not so many people are using Swift for such a contest while I want to see how other people would solve them using Swift.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I expect a good template will encourage more people to join it, and that is very beneficial each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it will do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People can focus their core algorithm with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will be a template to avoid any troublesome things to attend a programming contest like reading files and input, organizing output files and even source code to submit maybe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I classified things what you do not want to do during the contest, and they were like following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Read contents of an input file and assign those values to variables
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prepare files for submission
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It can mess up after each submission
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We solved each problem by
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Make readInput() -&gt; Type for variety of Types. You can do like:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                let N: Int = readInput()
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                let (N: Int, M: Int) = readInput()
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                let S:[String] = readInput()
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What you should do is just hit ./execute.sh and submit files in ./Outputs directory. ./execute.sh builds the source code, copies source code and input code for reuse and output a result by passing input to the executable and make a zip file of all source files.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since ./execute.sh copies /Inputs and /Sources in the same directory as output files, you feel easy to clear the core algorithm for previous problem.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enabling assignment like let (N: Int, M:Int) = readInput() for many types cannot be done in general way but we had to define variety type of tuples. Making the decision of giving up on that part took long.

                <p>
                    I am very happy that we could finish this and I can use this in this year's GCJ.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I felt the power of a teamwork by seeing that everybody has different skills. What we made is kinda different from what I thought at first, of course in better way.

                    We'll see while using it in real situation :)
