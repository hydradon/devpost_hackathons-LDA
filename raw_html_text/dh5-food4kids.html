                    I created this website during DeltaHacks 5 which took place on 26/27 Jan 2019. This website is my attempt at the Triangle Challenge : Donation Shop Webpage - Food4Kids with the Original Problem statement
                </p>
                <p>
                    Food4Kids is looking for a webpage that will offer donors the ability to purchase specific items that will go into bags for the children to receive. Ideally this will be one page that acts as a grocery store for donors to pick and choose their items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's my first time solving a real-world problem using Web Development, which was really fun to play around! Since I wanted to experiment, I tried to make it from the ground.
