                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game that Inspired me is the game everyone has played, Flappybird. I wanted to change it up to give a different feeling but keep it as interactive.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game where you use incoming blocks as stepping stones to avoid falling down into the water.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the characters and game objects I used free assets from Unity. I built this game with Unity and Java. I used Unity to build the game design and Java to write scripts for the game objects.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working alone on this project has been difficult where most of my time has gone towards research. Another challenge was working with Unity as it was foreign to me and getting the scripts right/
