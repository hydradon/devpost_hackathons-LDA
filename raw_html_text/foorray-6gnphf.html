                <p>
                    My mom always asked me what do i want for dinner tonight? and I could not really give her the answer because I didn`t have a strong preference. If somebody or something could give a randomly chosen name of the food and recipe, it could give me a brief idea what would I want to have for dinner tonight!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Shake Foorray and get a randomly chosen Wegman`s food recipe!

                    We use Wegmans API implement into our application

                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Wegmans`s API which  it does not fully show of the details of the foods on the page we were trying to implement on.

                    The logo suits with the warm and trustworthiness image of Wegmans and the app helps consumers to get an idea of what to cook or to have today which is a daily assignment we face everyday.
