                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CBT is proven to be an effective tool to help people with depression and anxiety to manage their emotions in a mindful way. However, these sessions requires making appointments for face-to-face interaction with therapists. Since this first step needs to be taken proactively by the patient and is asking them to get out of their comfort zone, many people tend to not go through with therapy sessions or delay their sessions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CognitiveIO tries to help alleviate the stress of interaction for first time patients to take their first step in achieving their mental health goals. Since many people, especially those with depression and anxiety, are more comfortable with online conversations, it helps alleviate stress for them if it's their first time with CBT.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First I gathered information about CBT - what it is, what are the steps, and which parts or steps can be completely transferred to an online portal. Then I designed how the ideal web pages would look like in the final demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathering the steps for CBT was very difficult as most of the resources were directing to therapists for a complete guide. Since it is a sensitive issue, not much information is available online on the exact assignments, questions, response types etc. that therapists use for their patients to prevent people from self-diagnosing or trying to (incorrectly) treat themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                </h2>
                <p>
                    A mobile interface would be even more accessible for users. Further, CognitiveIO would be able to go to the next level by doing integration with therapy clinics to provide a chat system for therapists and patients to interact with each other through the portal.
