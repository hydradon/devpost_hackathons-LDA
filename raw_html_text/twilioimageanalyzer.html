                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something that combined a variety of APIs. Also we thought a tool to analyze photos on your phone would be nice. This way you can just text an image and get results back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>This project uses Twilio and the Google API to process images sent by a user. The code to process the Twilio requests is running on a Lincode server. A user sends an image to our specified Twilio number and gets back the text in that image.
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Process:
1) A user sends an image to the Twilio phone number. Phone Number is :(845) 999-3027.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Twilio stores that image to a url which is available in the request message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Next we get the MediaURL from the request message and download the actual image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4) The image is then passed on to the Google Vision API and a process is run to detect text in the image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5) Once the analysis is finished, a string is returned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6) The returned string is sent back to the user using Twilio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Languages:
                    Python
API:
Google Vision API -Analyzes images sent by the user.
Twilio API - Receives the image from the user and returns the analysis.
Server:
Linode Server-Runs the python script to handle the Twilio send and receive. It also handles the calls to the Google Vision API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some issues when getting the image from Twilio. We also had some issues getting the results back from the Google Vision API.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to get everything working together.

                <p>
                    Learned how to use Twilio and the  Google Vision API.

                    What's next for Twilio Image Analyzer

                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Allow the user to send a message along with the image to specify what type of analysis they want done on the image since the Google Vision API can analyze an image a variety of ways.
