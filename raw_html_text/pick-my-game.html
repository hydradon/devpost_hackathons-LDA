                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While trying to find a game to make.  I found that I was trying to decide what game it would be like...  Then we started to make a decision tree to find what type of game we wanted to make.  Then it turned into just picking a game...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It asks yes/no questions to pick a game to play.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Add more games.
Find a way to ask questions to filter a list down to just a couple answers and then give suggestions.
Instead of many yes/no questions.  Ask "age of youngest player", "number of players", etc.
