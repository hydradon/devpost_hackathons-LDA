                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to do this project through research of medical applications of machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The AI takes an image of a skin lesion as an input and makes a prediction as to what skin condition applies to the image and whether it is cancerous or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Keras and TensorFlow, which are python libraries for machine learning. I used a dataset called HAM 10000 which contained images of skin lesions used to train the machine learning algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the hardest challenges I ran into was formatting the dataset to be able to be properly formatted as an input for the AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my proudest accomplishments was being able to build a machine learning project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From this project I learned a lot about machine learning, its applications, and how the technology can better our quality of life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PyDerm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this project, I want to implement my own machine learning algorithm from scratch. A long-term goal of this project is to be able to detect a wider range of diseases such as lung cancer.
