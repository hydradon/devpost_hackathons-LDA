                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There has been little disparity in the housing market regarding the rent estimation which we would like to resolve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AccuRent is a web app which predicts the property rent using Graphlap's Machine learning library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used nodeJS for the API integration and UI development. The Machine learning model is built using Graphlab toolkit on the Flask(python framework).
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Feature Selection and choosing the right algorithm was little challenging
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Feature selection and algorithm implementation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the new machine learning APIs and feature selection tools.
                </p>
