                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Rhode to Success" seeks to find the most at risk schools in Rhode Island and match students at these schools with mentors from Brown University. Based on Rhode Island school data analyzed in R, the Providence district displayed trends for negative factors such as high suspension rates and lowest rates of students graduation. We found that Providence had highest rates in students suspensions, lowest high school graduation rates, and lowest teacher to student ratios, in comparison to schools in other districts. There are 2 schools that are exceptions in Providence, but they are both private schools. Therefore we would like to pilot this program with Brown University; having college students volunteer to help with math and reading homework in these schools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Beaker and R for data analysis of Rhode Island education data. We used HTML/CSS to display our main website, and Python/Flask/MongoDB for storing student sign up information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were both new to R, MongoDB, and one of us was new to web development, so we had to learn alot along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about  factors that affect students' performance in school
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rhode To Success
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to see this program implemented at Brown, and see if the rates decrease/increase over the next year
