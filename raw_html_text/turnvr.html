                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I knew from the very beginning that we were destined to change the way people think about driving. You see it in cars all across America - people taking their eyes off the road, and their hands off the wheel to mess with phones or other navigation equipment. Countless PR campaigns have tried to warn people of the dangers of this, but to no avail. Something had to change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We approached the problem from a different angle - what if the devices aren't the problem - what if the road is?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created the first and only fully immersive navigation system that removes all hazards of driving related to being able to see the road. These hazards include, but are not limited to:
                </p>
                <p>
                    And because this platform is built from the ground up for driver safety, we can ensure that no dangerous outside stimuli are there to distract the driver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to create the TurnVR interface, and we used a modified version of the BeamNG.drive video game to simulate real word driving and crashing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the trigonometry to work out with all of the direction finding was a big challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the very first navigation system designed to be wholly immerse and all-encompassing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Driving with this thing is even harder than we could have imagined.
                </p>

                    What's next for TurnVr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Testing in real cars. We think Phoenix will let us in.
