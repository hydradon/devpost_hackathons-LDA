                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looking for an idea for the Hackathon, we looked at UIPath and considered what could be automated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It draws grades off of Blackboard and throws it in an Excel file. So far.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly through drafts and planning, trial and error when that inevitably failed, and online tutorials. And some caffeine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first time users of UIPath, everything. Trying to efficiently extract data was difficult, so we did it inefficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works sometimes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're not good at UIPath, but it looks like it could be powerful in the right hands.
                </p>
