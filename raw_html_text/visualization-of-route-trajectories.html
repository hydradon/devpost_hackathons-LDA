                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make a visualization tool because the starter code to given to us was only able to map one route at a time in 2-D. Because of this, it was unable to give viewers an idea of multiple routes that the user took and the exact way they navigated. It also didn't measure the amount of time a person spent at a particular location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have two different visual tools; one that can map multiple trajectories in 3D using altitude, longitude, and latitude and one that can map the progress of a single trajectory over time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using various APIs from Python including Matplotlib, Plotly, TimeOS, Selenium, and NumPy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very difficult to figure out how to use the various graphic APIs, such as using screenshots in Folium from a virtual machine and being able to display certain data on routes such as amount of time and points that were visited multiple times.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Visualization of Route Trajectories
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These visual representations are instrumental to understanding travel patterns and transportation in Beijing, and potentially could be used to provide route recommendations between two locations. Using various data algorithms to process the frequency of certain areas and points visited and amount of time spent on each route, it is possible to be able to create a recommended route.
