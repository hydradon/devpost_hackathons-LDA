                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was going to my midterm and was thirsty, but could not find any nearby water fountains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It requests for the user's location, then shows nearby water fountains that they can fill up their bottle at! But if they do not know how to get to that specific location, then they can use the built-in directions to get there! It helps with the reduction of plastic waste by making the locations more well known.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scraped for the locations of all the water fountains using Python3 and LXML and exported as a JSON object. The website is built using HTML and Javascript with the Google Maps API and hosted on an AWS S3 instance with a CloudFront for SSL (necessary to request user's location).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into design challenges as originally we had wanted to create an android app for it in Kotlin, but due to time restraints and issues with getting the software installed on our laptops we eventually switched to running the website. We also had struggled with making the website look decently, as none of us are particularly good at CSS. (As of writing this there's also a typo on the main webpage that was fixed, but AWS CloudFront is slow so it may or may not be fixed)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We overcame what had set us back, and found solutions to the problems we faced. We are also proud to have a working instance of our project also, as it is something that's not only fun but also useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about working together on projects, and being efficient, especially as it was our first hackathon.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make it more smooth for mobile users and possibly share it to school.
