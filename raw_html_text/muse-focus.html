                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were checking out the hardware available to us, and we looked up what Muse was. We wanted to try something new, and after seeing what Muse does, we were captivated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The focus app connects to the Muse headband and pulls the EEG data to monitor your concentration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We downloaded the LibMuse SDK and the Muse IO SDK in order to get bluetooth compatibility and accessible data for our app. Using the LibMuse SDK, we modified the code so that it would only display and analyze the data concerning concentration, namely the EEG data. With the Muse IO, we were able to test the Muse headband and determine a threshold of EEG amplitude that indicated whether the subject was concentrating on the task given. We take this data and display the concentration status of the subject on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major challenge we had was using both the LibMuse SDK and the Muse IO SDK; the two kits would not work together on the same computer,  but eventually we decided to use the SDKs on two different computers. Another challenge was figuring out how to interpret the data given by the Muse, since it is different from typical EEG measurements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to come up with a fairly accurate threshold to measure concentration. We have also never used a Muse headset or Android Studio before, so we are proud that we were able to figure out both tools during the Hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio to create apps, how to use the Muse, and how to read EEG data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for focus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make our measurement of concentration more accurate when it switches between different people. We would also like to add another feature to the app that would collect and store the concentration data over time and allow you to see your progress in focusing over a period of time.
