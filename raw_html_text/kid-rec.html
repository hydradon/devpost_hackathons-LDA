                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As SEL is a new trending for EdTech, my team wants to build up an application to promote SEL awareness, firstly, for Vietnamese people and then provide a tool to help kids develop their social and emotional learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app will:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        promote the face-to-face communication through technology
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        be built on interesting activities of SEL
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        specially develop sharing and story telling skills of not only kids but also their parents
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Being built on gamification in which the kids must complete the key tasks by recording video.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            In Vietnamese, SEL is still quite vague so this app must be one of the first SEL apps.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            On the world, solving the face-to-face communication while using mobile devices to learn SEL is rare. This app is simple in a very unique way.

                        I'm not familiar with facial expression detection to makes the games more interesting.

                        As my team member is a SEL teacher, she is quite strong for SEL activities developing. However, she also has got problems when brainstorming for attractive mobile games.
