                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming from rural Colorado, I didn't really have much in the way of coding classes, so I had to seek out the
opportunity to code and learn on my own. I feel it's necessary to present coding as fun and also a challenge to
the youth of america. I wish I had the opportunity to start using the resources when I was younger. This product
is essentially, a love letter to my younger self.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has an embbedded sudo-code language that I implemented through game maker. Players will type in functions
to manipulate the player to preform certain tasks. The goal of the game is to make it through with as little "re codes" as
possible. Essentially challenging the player to think a head, and implement a large portion of code at once to get the higher score. But if a player hits a wall they have to start the level over from scratch. This simulates a real coding environment where you want to implement as much code as possible in one session. but not to much where you have to do a bunch of debugging. So in addition the player learns to advantages and disadvantages of certain coding styles

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In what I would say is a poetic fashion, I coded it in the language and engine I learned first, game maker studio. Game maker was the software that taught me to code, so it only seemed right that I taught other to code on the same software. In addition Game maker has the functionality to make a high quality game in a short amount of time.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never really worked with text and string in game maker before, so this was particularly hard to implemented. I would say a bulk of my time was dedicated to storing, printing, and reading string in the right way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just that I was able to learn so much about text and array implementation in game maker studio. Obviously a lot of this was independent, so to make a fully flushed out game in essentially a day has given me a lot of confidence going forward.

                    I learned how to work with strings and text in game maker studio, checking, storing, and writing

                    What's next for Learn to Code: Hackathon 2019
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project defiantly made me want to make a much bigger project in game maker studio, to really test the limits of this engine. This project has certainly reinvigorated my passion for game development again
