                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The machine learning demo at hack umbc, replaced our original idea because we realized the hardware available made our original goals impossible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moves, detects faces, and displays relative location
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python, opencv, and raspberry pi
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our entire original plan was scrapped because we decided the motors weren't fast enough for or plans.Opencv would not compile on the pi, motors would not initially work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting started in face tracking at all, on a raspbery pi too. Starting with machine learning is soething we've wanted to do also.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to better implement pre-written code instead of doing it yourself. How to learn to change plans and consolidate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Face Tracking Robot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to have a robot that would follow faces on wheels rather than just swivel
