                    When we arrived the first day on campus we were lost while commuting between different buildings. It would be very hard for disabled people to walk around campus when they cannot perceive their surroundings as efficiently as we do.

                    It helps to identify key entry points into a building, walking paths, zebra crossings &amp; unidentified construction. Then it sends audio and vibration messages to save the person from falling.
