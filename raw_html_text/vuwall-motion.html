                    In all seriousness, our team comes from the video wall market where we have customers who would like to collaborate on a video wall in their board room or meeting room using touch screens. But in reality this is unusable! Imagine a 5x5 wall with 55 inch screens in a board room for a total diagonal of 275 inches. First of all if you are touching your video wall at one end you will not be able to clearly see what is at the other end so every time you move a window you will have to move back to a reasonable distance. And then there's the fact that not everybody is 9 feet tall so unless you run a company of giants, your board room is gonna need a ladder.

                    We got 40 green, mean, and lean passing tests (integration and unit). Like a boss.
We also achieved multi myo band window control and collaboration.

                    (recalling layouts, calling scripts, talking to network devices such as lights or blinds)
The greatest improvement would be using Euler angles only for screen positioning so the calibration would tell the software at what angle the edges of the screen are and this would allow us to get rid of the distance from screen.
