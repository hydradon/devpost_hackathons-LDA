                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the idea of a travelling and exploring game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fetches all pinned data on the app with radius around 1 mile, so you would be invited to find out more pins as you go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used SQL and PHP to build and interact with the the database. We used Java for the front-end app with the Android Studio IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Get the app to communicate with the server to download the API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Applying google maps api and obtaining key to integrate it with our app.
2) Working back-end database to return nearest and top hot pins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned how to use Git more efficiently. We have also updated our communications and networking skills as being part of a team.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pin It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to pin not only quotes and pictures, but music and even videos in the local area.
