                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The default alarm clock on my iPhone is easy to stop in bed. In order for me to wake up, I need an alarm clock app that makes me get out of bed. That's what I did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the app, you can set the time of the alarm and the code you want to scan to stop the alarm. The code can be either a barcode or a QR code. When the alarm goes off, there is no other way to stop the alarm other than scanning the selected barcode/QR code. A user could set the barcode on their toothpaste as the stop code, therefore making the user walk up to the bathroom to stop the alarm!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built with React Native. This means it is compatible with both iOS and Android. I also used Expo.io to make the process of building and testing easier.
