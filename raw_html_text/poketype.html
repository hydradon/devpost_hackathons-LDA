                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make this skill after playing Pokemon Sun and Moon, the new Pokemon games extensively after they came out. During our adventures, we often found ourselves wondering what type a certain pokemon was. Pokemon Sun and Moon brought back memories of our childhoods, filled with hours of endless Pokemon fun. We realized how useful an Alexa skill that enabled you to determine the type of a Pokemon would be during gaming sessions. Our love for Pokemon, and determination to learn Amazon Lambda and Web Serices inspired us to make this skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill allows you to ask your Alexa the type of any Pokemon. The Alexa will then run the skill, and return the type of the Pokemon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we used node.js and the poke api to retrieve information about Pokemon. Then we connected it to the Alexa Voice Service by using an express server and allowing it to take commands from Alexa. FInally, we deployed this server to the Heroku cloud in order for it to always be running.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges while trying to get the Heroku cloud service to run. The terminal commands were quite tricky to figure out, but we were eventually able to. Another challenge we ran into was making the node.js interact with the poke api as we had trouble making the http requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to configure the Heroku server to work with Amazon Alexa Skills Tools. We are also proud of our node.js code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about node.js, heroku, and Amazon Skills Tools. We learned how to build Alexa Skills, publish them onto Amazon's web store, and run them on Alexa. We also learned how to configure a Heroku service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PokeType
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PokeType will continue to add future generations of Pokemon, and eventually add more information such as Pokemon weaknesses or stats.
