                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a manufacturer company, Quality Assurance (QA) is one of the most critical parts of the production process. There are a number of good framework which can help manufacturer to find out key factors, identify the optimum levels or tolerances, and how to do improvement, for example Six Sigma. It turns out that there are many manual processes involve in this process. We have an idea to create a system to guide the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automatic QA is a system that can help what already explained above. It currently has some processes, for example Define process, Measurement process, and Recommendation process. Some of the features are still in the alpha stage, while some are ready to be used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Nodejs, with the help of Efficiency Analyzer (EA) and Enterprise Plant Insights (EPI) API, and run on top of the Predix platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While other cloud provided a relatively general solution, we learned how Predix can provide an specific cloud for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). It provided many ready to used elements that help our team to build this system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Automatic QA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is still the alpha stage of Automatic QA, we are planning to keep improving it, solving bugs, and make enhancement of it.
