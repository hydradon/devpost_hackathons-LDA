                    Soon Christmas is here, and what better than a game to play with friends and family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Christmas you take Santa's job and decide to deliver presents yourself. You run from roof to roof dropping presents through people's chimneys. Look out for obstacles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built it using PyGame in Python using Visual Studio Code and Photoshop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Detecting collision detection took longer than what we anticipated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've managed to make a fully functional game in under 24 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had to play around with sprites and implement collision detection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next for Santa Claus Job we will have bonus points, lives and shields which will protect you against some obstacles.
