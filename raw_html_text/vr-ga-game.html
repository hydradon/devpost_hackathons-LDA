                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to integrate different systems which can interact with a user in real life, and affect something in the environment around them. The integration of a voice recognition machine with virtual reality was the avenue we chose, and that can be a powerful tool for several purpose such as gaming, rehab, entertainment, or smart manufacturing as it is an open and very new area of technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a game where the user is involved in a virtual reality environment. The google assistant takes a command from a player currently in game. It then sends a command to be read by a python script. The script transforms the message based on its inputs and relays the command to the game, resulting in an action in the game environment. In this way we create a framework able to interact with the user and a template for other applications.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding. IFTTT.com, lots of documentation, blood sweat and tears, lots of testing for sent packets. Lots of cross-checking for cases.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to make the different systems communicate, integrating them robustly.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the google assistant to interact with the unity environment successfully. Successfully creating and controlling a gamign enviroment through voice commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding pyhton for something that is communicating with other devices. Interactign with a VR environment through unity, all the gaming features available through shared online communities,
                </p>

                    What's next for VR GA Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating more efficiently different systems such as microcontroller, sensors, actuators. Potential applications involved more complex games, connecting different computers with multi-players, rehabilitation training or industrial applications
