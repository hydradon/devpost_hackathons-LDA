                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Games are the escape to another world. But its not much fun if you don't feel like you are there. VR is a great way to use Human Vision to get you in the game. But we decided to use Computer Vision to bring you into the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is based on the idea of using the immense operations of computer vision we can take a picture of you and upload it so it can build a playable character in the game that looks like you, is dressed up like you and resembles you in many other ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and working with OpenCV, we tried analyzing images of players and replicate them onto a simple graphics program which is also created with Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is proud of committing the time and efforts to something that, initially, we believed was impossible to build. We are also proud that we believed in the project and its potential in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to appreciate the processing, programming and intelligence that goes into computer vision and how difficult it is to develop software for that. I learnt that time is never a problem if you really believe in a project .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Now you see me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our plan was to be able to build an simplified overview of what a player is wearing in real life from a image that could later be used as Minecraft skins. We weren't able to accomplish that, we weren't even close but this is our next stage in our journey.
