                    In order to minimize waste accumulation, this app allows users to upload photos of items they no longer want that others can receive through email communication with the owners. Users can take pictures with their camera or upload pictures from the photo gallery, add labels and their contact info (hidden from the main screen), and add to the list of available items. Keyword search is also enabled to help users find specific items or related items.

                        Our Tale
                    </strong>
                    This journey started when three clueless souls, without hackathon experience (or much programming experience or much life experience) and without teammates, joined in a meeting of fate outside a bathroom on the beautiful campus of Yale University, on a stretch break during the 8 hour bus ride down to Princeton. After bonding amidst the biting cold, long bus ride, and mutual need for teammates, they joined in their shared experience with Android (read: one of them realized their phone ran on Android, the other two recognized the cool little green dude they knew they had seen before). Filled with innocent hope, they decided to embark on a mission to build an Android app to help reduce the amount of reusable items floundering in the garbage dumps. Needless to say, after two hours of diagramming and goggling at Android Studio, the little green dude didn't seem as cuddly anymore. Programs were crashing, tabs of Google searches and Stack Overflow were spilling over the top of the screen, and Android Studio was calmly observing the destruction in her wake. A few hours and a few packs of Welch's fruit snacks later, we had implemented a button that took us to another screen. Like magic. Hope was renewed, even though the Rice Krispies had run out.

                    The next day, we entered the Friend Center with steeled bonds and motivation- we had trudged through the cold in the depth of night and the battled against the icy winds in the crack of morning- what was a few hundred more lines of code? Long story short, it's been about 13 hours since we've stepped foot outside. First, Challenger AddItem added a solid 10 hours to our agenda, sneaking jabs and stabs with permissions errors, null pointer exceptions, spontaneous moody crashes, DialogFragments, AlertDialogBuilders, Bitmaps, ArrayAdapters, and ListViews to guard the successful addition of a new ListView element. Next, Sir SearchBar rushed forward, and thrust us behind Youtube tutorials, menus, inflaters, queries, and filters. Finally, to remind us of our place, Reigning Champion ActivityViewOrContext and his buddies VersionNotSupported and WhatsAServer swept us back onto the floor and ran away. We peeled ourselves off the speckled tiles after they rounded the corners, and swore revenge on our next encounter.

                    Now, equipped with new memories, knowledge, and friends after our first hackathon, we hope you find our app as derpy as our story, and that you enjoy taking random pictures and sending random emails. Funny- even the cold outside doesn't pose as big of a threat anymore. That is, until we step outside.
