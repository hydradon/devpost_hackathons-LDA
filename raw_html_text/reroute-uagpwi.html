                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A book called the Power of Habit - which describes how people will change their detrimental habits by changing the routine they do to get the same reward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in information about the user at the beginning and gives 3 options to choose to quit: smoking, drinking and drug use. Then it helps them change the routine that is associated with the habit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the app using xcode and swift and used Sketch to create the UI of the application. We coded the app from scratch and also included multiple options and motivators for the person using the app to continue to use our app to get rid of their habit.
We made an informational website as well. It has information about habits, and statistics about smoking, drinking and drug use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were beginners in both html and xcode and also in sketch and were in full experimenting mode so we faced some challenges along the way with debugging and making sure the layouts were good. The css code was difficult to sift through and to edit since it was part of a template. We did the html from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is fully functional except for the profile and the progress page. And there are no bugs in it through the user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about xcode and the different layouts we can use in xcode. We also learnt how to use html and css and got familiar with the language more than we did before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for reRoute
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make a progress page where the user can earn points for following their routines. This will motivate them to do it more. We also want to help them refer to a therapist as well since that is the most ideal way to help get over a habit. We can do this through local therapists and helping them post their profiles from our website and our progress report so a therapist can contact them.
