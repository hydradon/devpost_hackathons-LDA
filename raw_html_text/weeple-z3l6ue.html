                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We live in a time where political engagement in the United States is at a historic low, especially among millennials. This overall disengagement in politics, among other things, inspired us to build a project aimed at motivating citizens, especially the younger generation, to get involved in the political process as voters or representatives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Weeple aims to bridge the gap between voters and representatives by creating an engaging and rewarding online political process which gives all citizens, whether they&rsquo;re voting or running for office, a platform to express their beliefs, get informed, stay connected, and have their voices heard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this demo version of Weeple with Java, PHP, and SQL to run on Android phones as a mobile application. Our website, which serves as a landing page to point people in the direction of the app, was built using WordPress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few challenges over the weekend. For example, one team member had mandatory work all day Saturday which forced the team to work separately but cohesively for a good portion of HackFSU.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to shape an idea and turn it into a demo version of a working product in just a few days time, especially since there were only two of us on the team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the best way to turn an idea into a reality is to simply start working on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Weeple
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to publish a finished version of the Android application online by the end of February. We also plan to have the iOS application published in the iTunes App Store by the end of March. Our third goal is to continue working with our team to polish Weeple and turn it into a project that truly does inspire people to get more engaged in politics.
