                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many apps like Magic-US, use a lot of man power to help customers book/get things that they want for their daily routine. The idea initially started as a means of automating this process of booking/getting things for people. However, we also figured out that conventional UI's don't feel as intuitive as something like a free-form search/voice queries, hence we came up with the idea to de-personalize the concept of digital assistants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Genie, is a single web platform, where most of all your digital life is condensed yet simplified. The user has the freedom to be anywhere 'virtually' and 'simultaneously'. Right now, for the alpha version, we have simple services like Spotify, and current weather up online, along with a really simple search bar to search what the user feels like. It uses natural language processing to understand what the user contextually wants. Social media comprises of tweeter at the moment with further support coming soon. Genie also has an integration of IoT. Also, there an update for speaking to Genie and getting your email written and when pressed "Email", you get the options to email it to anyone you want.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to stick to web development since, Web has the potential to breach the barrier of platform and reach almost everyone with smart devices. Hence, we chose the HTML5/CSS/Javascript stack to work the frontend and PHP as the backend, with calls to python for natural language processing through the famous NLTK library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make the process of booking and/or getting things for users more easy and intuitive, but could not get to an acceptable level of doing so, since the payment services require 3rd party formal tie ups with companies. We also wanted to incorporate the Uber API for seamless integration of cab booking, but could not do so. Also, for our idea to actually reach full potential, we look forward to a long time development process.
                </p>
