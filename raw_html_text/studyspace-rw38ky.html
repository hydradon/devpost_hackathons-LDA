                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thought of the idea when brainstorming app ideas with friends then pitched it to a group for a Business class project which they wanted to continue with the idea. Hack Western seemed like a good time to build a prototype (or close to one)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to create posts viewable to Tutors who can send an application for the post. Users can edit their display picture only currently and chat functionality was not implemented. Also some other functionality was not completed due to time constraints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All in android studio with Firebase for Storage, Database, and Authentication
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Configuring and using Firebase database and storage. I had little experience with database and storage even outside of Firebase so having to structure it as best as possible would have been the biggest challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had not done most of what I did today before, specifically Firebase. I am proud of the workarounds and hacks as I would have expected there to be more having to do a lot of tedious coding by doing this app on my own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use a Storage service to store an image picked by the phone and to update it on the phone UI. My other main learning experience was setting up the Firebase database to show to data I wanted (Even though it was not set up as efficiently as it should be, workarounds were necessary for me). I learned many small things along the way to building out the prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Studyspace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Complete the prototype, then try to build it either in a web app or a cross platform mobile app with React Native for if I decide to try to get the app to production.
