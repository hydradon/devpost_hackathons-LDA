                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's the best way to skin a cat? Not sure, but there are several ways to find tillable land in an aerial image of arable land. We wanted to explore our options and find a clever, quick way of solving this problem.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    tillable uses a stack of filtering, thresholding, and morphological manipulations to find zones in an aerial image that would most likely be arable land.

                <p>
                    There are a lot of ways to do this problem, and we spent maybe 4-5 hours exploring other options before we settled on a hybrid SLIC/K-means based dilated filtering method.

                    We wrote 4 very fancy end-to-end implementations of different algorithms that didn't work.

                    Sometimes the simple solution is the best solution.

                    Calculation of arable land is a trivial addition to our implementation. The real next step is implementation of some kind of neural net, probably a ConvNet for classification of non-arable land areas, such as recognizing houses, barns, streets, rivers, etc. a la
