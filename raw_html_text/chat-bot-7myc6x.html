                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a chat bot, but I couldn't really get that down. So for some reason, I made Roulette. That led to me making other casino games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can play various casino games: Roulette, Poker, Slots, Blackjack, and Guess a Number.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created it with the site "Scratch.mit.edu." It uses ActionScript, with the ability to drag blocks and create scripts. The use of variables, operators, and lists are very important.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I couldn't for my life figure out how to make the Dealer intelligent, until all I had to do was remove this tiny script that made it stay dumb. To be honest it is still dumb, but it should prove to be more "human."

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am now a promoter of gambling (jk)
I have the ability to code a little better on Scratch, now.
I am genuinely proud that I pushed through and made a game that was pretty complex.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that someone can't go 24 hrs straight awake unless they are determined to finish. I stayed up 23 hrs.
                </p>

                    What's next for Happy Pub Casino
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll refine the games, and make the Dealer smarter.
