                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like Pokemon and are interested in how people would answer these questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Questions are asked and you count up your points depending on your answers to the questions, then your points are 
added up to equal to a personality trait which represents a Pokemon.
                </p>
