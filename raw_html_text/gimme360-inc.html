                    We believe that Augmented Reality (AR) represents the greatest opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our platform is a toolkit that democratizes augmented reality to businesses who historically didn't' have the coding knowledge or resources to share their creations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "We think augmented reality will be equally transformative both for a consumer and an enterprise perspective - a market opportunity of $83 Billion by 2020." - Goldman Sachs 2017
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our strategic partners include IBM, CISCO and Microsoft - with a team of 15 individuals we are poised to be the AR catalyst in the real estate space. We believe AR and our SaaS platform can help;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Allow customers to visualize possibilities for design features easier, quicker, and to scale
                    <br>
                    Such as design textures, colours, even traffic patterns, lighting, other constraint features such as fire hydrants, nearby building (and their shadows), plants and sidewalks (more for developers and architects)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Allow users to visualize what a space is (remotely) and what it could be (in space) making an image tangible
                </p>
                <p>
                    A more cost effective and simpler way to personalize and make changes to 3D design plans opposed to models
E.g. the difference in price between investing in an &ldquo;AR home&rdquo; and a model home to show to prospective clients
                </p>
                <p>
                    More compelling way to present plans to customers and expanded marketing options (e.g. interactive advertisement boards, greater exposure from the App Store, or users could explore possibilities remotely)
