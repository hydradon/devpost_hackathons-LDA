                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music is such a big part of our lives in that currently music software does not fully maximize the potential of music.  We address the issue by creating our own playlist program for playing back music, which crossfades songs on beat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The software emulates a real DJ when playing back music, which is meant to be mostly electronic.  The song consists of metadata alongside the file, which is manually generated at present time.  When a song ends, then metadata associated with the next song is combined with the metadata of the current song to blend the two songs together, which results in natural transitions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using C++ for the backend, along with Qt for the desktop application.  We also used Python and HTML for the web interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many issues.  One big issue was porting the application from Linux, which was the platform it was built for, to Windows.  We had to install various libraries in order to port the program.  Another issue was making the program look elegant.  We noticed that the picture was distorted, and after careful implementation of fixes, we were able to resolve the problem.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program functions, and it can run on Windows.  Also, the program has a frontend, which makes it usable by any user.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that sometimes implementing simple functionality in a short time frame can take a very long time.

                    What's next for MusicMixer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement automatic beat detection and individual song selection.  We also hope to perhaps make an Android or iOS version in the future.
