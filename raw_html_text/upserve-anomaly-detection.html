                    PROBLEM (WHY? ):
From our data exploration of the UPSERVE
dataset, we noticed that there were quite a few
anomalies. Anomalies could cost a restaurant a
significant amount of money if the restaurant is
unable to meet demand. How could we help
mitigate the damage from these anomalies??
                </p>
                <p>
                    SOLUTION:
Using time series anomaly detection, which
mixes studentized residuals with Grubbs&rsquo; test,
we will detect anomaly occurrences. Many
anomalies do not just occur over one day. The
idea is that if we can detect the occurrence of an
anomaly the day after it happens, we can offer
recommendations to the restaurant to help them
capitalize on potential opportunities. (e.g.
Nearby marathons)
                </p>
                <p>
                    USER INTERFACE:
We implemented a local website UI that takes in
a store id and then outputs a plot of sales revenue
over a 30-day period, as well as whether the
current revenue is an anomaly or not. If you are
currently at an anomaly, the UI also outputs a list
of events. (e.g. Nearby marathons)
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHERE UPSERVE COULD TAKE THIS:
UPSERVE&rsquo;s product currently gives restaurants
percent changes in revenue. During our Datathon
we did not have access to exact locations of
restaurants. UPSERVE DOES have access to
this and can combine that data with our anomaly
detection model to give accuracy event listings
and anomaly recommendations.
