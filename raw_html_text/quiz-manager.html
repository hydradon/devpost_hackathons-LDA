                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted an easy way to create quizzes without having to step through multiple steps in the Blackboard UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adds questions to an existing quiz within the Blackboard Learn platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used ruby to talk to Blackboard's REST API from the command line.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran to issues with the API not being able to do what we needed it to do.  Creating quizzes from the API wasn't possible.  In addition, we were limited to one question type (presentation) when using the API.  This meant we couldn't create multiple choice, true/false, anything really.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't kill each other and we were able to get something working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the limitations of the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quiz Manager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think we are going to have to wait for the next version of the API to come out before any progress can be made in this project.
