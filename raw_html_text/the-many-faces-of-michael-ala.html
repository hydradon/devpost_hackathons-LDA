                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Michael Ala is an attractive man. So I decided to make a game with his face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You find his face in the numerous pictures and then you click it. When you click it you get to the next page where you can find his face again and then click on it again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML, got help from the mentors around me, and cried a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding clever places to put his face. It's a lot of trial and error which is tedious and annoying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the end I put a , "PLAY AGAIN" option that brings you back to the first page all by myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use HTML and GitHub. How to place one image ontop of another while making the image ontop a link to the next page of the game. I learned how to use text and edit it using CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Many Faces of Michael Ala
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of his face being in the same spot each time, the spot will be randomly generated. Instead of pictures where his face is easy to find there will be more complex pictures making it a more complex game. I hope that I can learn Java in order to place a timer in the game so I can add a ranking function (person with the fastest time wins).
