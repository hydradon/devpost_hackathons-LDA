                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mental heath is a very prominent issue in modern society. Statistics show that 20% of the worlds population will personally experience mental illness in their lifetime. We we're very shocked by these statistics and decided to try to make a helpful tool for people who are experiencing mental health issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app helps people with mental issues connect with people who have gone through similar situations with mental health. This application gives users the opportunity to talk with their peers, and form a social network to benefit their health.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using react.js and firebase we built a framework for a larger project. We also used CSS for all the aesthetics of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to quickly decide on a framework to go with and ended up switching back and forth between react and traditional js several times before deciding to go with react
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel like we ended up with an almost functional web app that could help address the issue of mental health
We are happy with the UI/UX design that we came up with
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When on a time crunch like this, decide on a framework and just power through with it, and don't switch unless you are confident that you will have enough time to complete the project on time
                </p>

                    We plan on enhancing the features of our app and integrating a better filtering system for user matching.
