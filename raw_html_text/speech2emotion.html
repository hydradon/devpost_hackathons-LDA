                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not much sentiment analysis is done based on raw audio file/streams. First, it will be cool and challenging to do real-time sentiment analysis based on audio. Second, this can be used to track the progress of conference/meeting. Based on the evolution of attendants' emotion, we can keep the topic/discussion/meeting on track.

                <p>
                    It take an audio file as input and visualize the emotion changes in real-time.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Microsoft Bing Speech API to convert audio files into text. Then used spaCy and gensim to parse text and map each word to a 300-dimension vector with float-type elements (using word2vec). Then we projected text onto different types of emotions, used softMax to normalize and some data smoothing. Finally we got a emotion-vector for each chunk of text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The Bing Speech API does not provide real-time parsing interface for Python. We have to manually chop audio file into small chunks and tweak the function to update for a certain interval. 2. Real-time analysis requires great computing performance.
