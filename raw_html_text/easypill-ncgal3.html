                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our group members had noticed the struggles of people who had dementia. Particularly when they were taking important medication that they couldn't miss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to help people who may have trouble remembering to take important medication by building both a smart robotic dispenser that automatically dispenses pills on a set schedule, and an online dashboard to configure and monitor this robotic dispenser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EasyPill is a comprehensive dispensing system that is able to notify a user to take their medicine and automatically dispense it when appropriate. It is also a safe storage solution for medication, since all pills are hidden behind the dispensing mechanisms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To add a dispensing schedule, users simply log on to the web app and then add a new dosage using the intuitive menu. Users can also manually dispense medication when required at the click of a button through the android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the dispenser with an arduino and a few servo motors that rotate in tandem to dispense the pill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The online dashboard was built with React using Evergreen UI and Firebase a backend. 
There was also a node backend that serialized the Firebase data and sent it to the dispenser through a serial connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, we had built an Android application to control the dispenser, but it only has part-functionality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a particularly tough time making bluetooth work on our android application as well as passing data through the server to our arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For many of our members, this was their 1st or 2nd hackathon and this was the first time they'd completed an hack. We were quite pleased that we could build a responsive application that could interface with both a database, and a real-world robotic dispenser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                        Probably a good idea to bring a wifi module with you

                        Android studio is pretty convoluted

                        Arduinos like to burn out and break

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to turn this into a fully-fledged system that is capable of identifying multiple types of pills using AI and dispensing them dynamically
