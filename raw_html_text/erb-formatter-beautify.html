                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a thing that impactful directly to people is a something that really matters to me, especially for my community in the developer environment. I have using VSCode editor for a couple of months and I notice that there is some part/features that are missing from them that actually needed by the developer to make their life easier. That's why I come up with this idea to create a small extension to format an ERB file (a template language for Ruby) to make it beautiful, this features do not exist yet in the marketplace, that's why I create it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will format your messy ERB files to make it beautiful (more readable).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am using a tutorial from VSCode website how to create a new extension. It is using typescript as the language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Find a proper library to use is a challenge because there is a bunch of libraries that can help to format it but does not have a built-in support for VSCode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Publish the extensions and hopefully, there is a person somewhere using this extension and make their life easier. I also already publish/advertise this extension in the related community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the simple thing that is subtle and not aims too big like want to create "the next facebook" etc is more satisfying. Because you know that you can finish the project in a limited time, and directly publish it and see the impact. Rather than developing something that big, but not fully functional in the end of the day, and you will continue to develop it later on IF you have time, but mostly you don't have it, I have that kind of experience in many hackathons that a team aiming too high, yes sometimes it is good and you win with that, but not everytime you follow up that idea because you are coming back to your real life in university and doing stuff. So that is why I change my approach of doing a hackathon project. Aim small but impactful to your community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And there is some quote from the hackupc page that saying
"So don't worry about coming up with the next big idea or building the next Facebook. You'll have plenty of time for that outside the hackathon. just focus on learning, having fun, and making new friends". That pretty much true I am doing the next big thing is outside of the hackathon.
