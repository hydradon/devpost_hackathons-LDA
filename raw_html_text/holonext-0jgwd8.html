                <h2>
                    Inspiration: Inspired by augmented reality's many uses, we are determined to create personalized systems of real world scenarios such as cooking, housing tours, surgical training, and more.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: We are in the process of developing our software to be easily personalized for any consumer. For example, we can create simulations helping people get over phobias. Then create a simulation for another person who wants to enjoy a field trip to a historic site where they can interact with objects. We can create simulations according to the customer requests and needs.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: We used a combination of programs such as Unity, Visual Studio, and Hololens. We had to create the code in unity and convert it over to the Hololens.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: We ran into a variety of problems ranging from downloading software that took hours to install to trouble converting code to Hololens. Since this is a field of technology currently in progress, it was hard to find tutorials on how to create an augmented reality for our users. We tried our best to create an accurate sample of how our software would work. Also we don"t have a Hololens to try our code out on.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: We are proud of what we have accomplished as a team not for the quantity of our work but for the quality and hardwork we poured into it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: We have learned the value of teamwork. We have also learned not to give up when you run into obstacles you have to keep going and overcome them. We have also learned more about Unity code and Augmented Reality options.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HoloNext: We are going to keep working on the code and perfect our systems. We know that there is use for our program and we are working hard to make it a reality.
