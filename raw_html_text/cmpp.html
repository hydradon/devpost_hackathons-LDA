                    cmpp reads in visual data from the user's laptop, focuses in on six points, and generates a tone based off of the color value of each point.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Initially, we tried making this a mobile app, but the framework we were using proved to be too limited for our needs. It was even more unfortunate that we discovered this with only hours to go! Pivoting to a web app came with its own problems, mainly React and getting components to talk to each other.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Managing to make something with p5 and music production, two things we've never tried before!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    p5 is pretty easy but not as easy as it seems. Also, it's hard to make sine waves sound pretty.

                    MIDI integration: enabling the reading of MIDI files for playback and the generation of MIDI files for use in audio production. Also, we'd like to integrate traditional video analysis tools, such as playing back and processing a YouTube video.
