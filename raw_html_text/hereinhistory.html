                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted an easy way to track an historic journey or chronological series of events.  Our original aim was to make a study tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows a user to create a map of chronological events leveraging Google Maps API seamlessly.  Information about each event can be added including date, general description an image and a youtube video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Flask server framework, hosted with Amazon Web Services and served over the internet with Apache and Nginx.  We built our front end with Bootstrap, Javascript and html.  Interfacing with Google Maps was done with Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Certain elements of working with the Google Maps api, including coloring the arrows.  Creating reactive pages to post from our page when creating the linked chronological 'tours'.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole thing.  First successful use of a Google API. It's also a tool that we could see ourselves using and sharing with our friends and family.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we can successfully use Google APIs!  That we can always come up with something to demo, even if it is held together with proverbial duct-tape.
                </p>

                    What's next for HereInHistory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More Interactivity, ability to search for tours created by others and better looking front end.
                </p>
