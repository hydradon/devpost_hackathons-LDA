                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of students in schools do not have the resources to fulfill the subject of theater arts. The little funding the school gets is prioritized to school supplies, not allowing them to develop and flourish their artistic skills. Students are the next generation, and not giving them the funding to programs that will help them develop as people for the future will have a considerable impact on their and our lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program allows for people to give students/schools direct donations as well as sell their instruments, props and other theater arts materials to help out the school(s) of their choice. By donating, the donator will receive discounts and/or possibly free entry to these performances that they helped funded using their own instruments and donations.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using HTML/CSS, Javascript, and eBay's APIs. The website was designed using HTML, CSS and Javascript and the login system uses the Google Cloud Platform for hosting/authentication.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few challenges while developing our idea. Having no experience with the eBay API, learning how to use it and integrating it into our program was a challenge. The tutorials helped us get a better idea of how it worked, but we struggled to get a solid understanding of the API. Another one was learning CSS. With our team having little to no experience with it was definitely a challenge. However, we were able to work and learn the language and syntax as well as some Javascript to have a website.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments we are proud of is getting a website for our idea running. It has multiple sub-pages along with a simplistic and usable design with a persistent header uniting them. The user interface and design of the site is very user friendly, giving them exactly what they are looking for. For not knowing much CSS, the website design was something we are proud of. Another thing we are proud of is getting the eBay API somewhat working. It was a difficult thing to understand and it working and integrated in our website is something we are proud of. With essentially no experience using API's, it allowed us to learn and begin to understand how an API worked and the possibilities when implementing into a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we learned is web development and design as well as how an API functions. The web development was interesting because we were able to create something with a nice and usable design despite the little experience we had with it. API's are definitely complicated but understanding the basics of them definitely gave a clearer idea of how it was supposed to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Giving Performances
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to get our eBay API working with our site more closely so that people can complete the process of donating and selling things end-to-end using eBay to schools of their choice. It will be a great way to fund and give schools what they need to enrich student's creative potential in art and theater.
