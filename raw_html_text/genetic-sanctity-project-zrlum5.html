                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Crops can be genetically engineered to live around some pretty nasty chemicals, but not all GMO's are bad. It doesn't matter what herbicides and pesticides are used in the valuable biofeuls sector, but livestock feed with trace quantities of fat soluble pesticides could lead to high pesticide concentrations in the food we consume.
In order to verify that our crops were not modified to enable pesticide and herbicide tolerance, we need a decentralized platform for genetic purity verification.
