                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Native Android app to handle the communication with the MUKI, node.js and mongodb backend to store and process the data and a beautiful web-interface to handle user interactions.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest challenges was the limited toolset MUKI provided technically. The lack of interaction made us think out of the box to ensure a working concept.
