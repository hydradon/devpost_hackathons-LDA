                    So, my inspiration for this project was to learn and experience form new coding challenges.

                    What I hope it will do is sell my GF's cat... I built it all with Flutter. The main challenge I ran into was getting the bid button to function because I didn't know about stateful widgets. I've learned that developing an app takes a lot of time and troubleshooting.
