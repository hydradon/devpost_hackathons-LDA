                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we started coding, we found normal coding syntax to be an unnecessary abundance of punctuation that is intimidating to learn at first, with big words like "variable" and "function" thrown at you from the start. We decided to create our own programming that removes all punctuation from our code and uses an algorithm to decipher your meaning behind the code, in simple ways like drawing a shape, or changing a color of an object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once you are logged in, you will be able to access the editor, which is comprised of the code input and the 2D canvas output. When typing specific keywords (currently only
                    <code>
                        set
                    </code>
                    and
                    <code>
                        draw
                    </code>
                    ), the program will interpret what you are trying to do (example: set the background color to orange), and execute that command. For each object drawn, a user can control a various set of properties, like position, color, size, and many others. It also scans your code for syntax errors and alerts you. Every time you make a change to your code, it is automatically saved in the cloud to your account, meaning you can access the code from anywhere without having to save.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by creating data structures which contained properties for each element type. By using these data structures, we then iterate through each element using a loop and print each one programmatically to the canvas. On the other side of the editor, we created an algorithm that would take a user generated input, strip down all filler words, and get the basic meaning of the line of code. We can then use the output of this algorithm to set assign different properties to the data structure. This project totaled to around 1500 lines of code.

                    Some of the hardest things to accomplish while creating our product were:

                    <li>

                        Creating user accounts that can save code automatically

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were aiming to just get the language done, but we virtually had finished by 3am, and we were ecstatic to continue adding more functionality to our program, such as user accounts. By the end of the hackathon, we are proud to have created an algorithm that can effectively convert casual English to code, full with a beautiful UI and UX.

                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to add more functionality to our program by adding logic and other features such as conditional statements and variables. This would add another layer of depth to Pseudo Code and we would love to continue spreading our passion of coding to the world of beginning programmers.
