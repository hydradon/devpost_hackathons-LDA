                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a project that would help people. We at first wanted to do something for children with learning disabilities but decided to broaden that scope to all children interested in Computer Science and Engineering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once we knew the demographic of our hack, we decided to make it interactive so kids would be interested throughout the whole game. Initially, we wanted to use a Myo armband but found that there weren't any available to use. However, we were able to substitute this with a Leap Motion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We tweaked our project to fit this hardware and made a story line revolving around Iron Man. Iron Man shoots things with his gauntlet repulsors so we decided to make the game around "helping" Iron Man fix J.A.R.V.I.S's code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the leap motion, kids are able to act like Iron Man and use their hands like gauntlets to answer simple programming problems that will "fix" J.A.R.V.I.S.
