                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently we've all been literally sick and have figuratively sick from hearing the same thing from doctors over and over again... a few days of rest will be fine. We decided it would be great if a website could help people determine if they need to make an expensive trip to the doctors.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a short interactive survey, our website takes common symptoms into account to determine the severity of someones illness and advise what to do
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a group of 100% beginners, we spent the first half of the day educating ourselves on html, javascript, and css, including the fundamentals of computer science.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all beginners so there was a common lack of knowledge in the group. Halfway through the hackathon, we lost all of our work and spent a significant amount of time trying to recover it. (This was the first hackathon for all of us)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering the fact that we were all beginners, we are proud that we managed not to have a mental breakdown and run away from the computer screaming and crying. We currently have a finished and working website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We increased our knowledge in html, javascript, css, and teamwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DIY Diagnosis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make it more specific to customer needs as we learn more about computer science and get more experienced.
