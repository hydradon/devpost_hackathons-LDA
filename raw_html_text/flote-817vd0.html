                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to motivate people to share information and interact in a new way: through augmented reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flote allows users to post notes in augmented reality, for personal use or for other people to see. It allows users to discover, read, and like/dislike other people's notes, which are tied to the geographical coordinate's at which they are placed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Unity and a JSON Server. The server is hosted by Google App Engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had challenges getting accurate GPS Coordinates for note placement, as well as using Google App Engine to host our server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use the Unity Engine to build a basic AR app, and have that app communicate with a JSON server to get and set information. We also got more familiar with Google App Engine and learned to use that to host our server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flote
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the design by adding different text bubbles and fonts to allow users to make their notes more unique. Implement private vs public note access, to allow users to designate the audience of their note. Add an optional comment section on every note to increase user interaction.
