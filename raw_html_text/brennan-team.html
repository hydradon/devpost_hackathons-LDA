                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to create a single app to manage all aspects of pet care including socialization, fitness tracking, and pet/owner connection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Social Petwork is a one stop shop for pet owners to engage in the social aspect of pet ownership as well as the health and safety of their animal friends. It creates a community of pets,  pet owners, and pet agencies where they can connect and share on everything from training and fitness tips to lost and found pets in their areas.
                    <br>
                    -Owners can establish friendships through the app and message each other to exchange training tips and set up play dates.
                    <br>
                    -Fitness tracking can be stored and monitored in the app and connected with existing bluetooth animal fitness trackers.
                    <br>
                    -The Lost and Found functionality provides geocodes and photos for pet sightings as well as a way to message the owner and arrange to get their pet home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The SocialPetwork is coded in HTML5 and Javascript. Project work was divided so that the basic template of each page was designed and implemented with page navigation and architecture by one team member while the other team members split off and designed the individual functionality of the Social, Fitness, and Lost and Found pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our prototype, we are using local memory for our data storage. In full production, we will be using a SQL server for backend storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining the social aspects of pet ownership with the finding and returning of missing pets allows us to address the problem of other missing pet forums where reports were not getting made and looked for in the same forums. Lost and found information is only be useful when the community is sharing information effectively and having one app for everything provides that unification of information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pet owners are very concerned about their pets well-being, but often don't have the tools or resources to care for their pets as they desire. ~55% of pets are overweight or obese and ~66% of lost pets are never found. Our app is designed to help bring those number down by providing a fun place to interact with other pet owners and an easy and effective way to report missing pets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The SocialPetwork
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The SocialPetwork plans to add functionality that will allow Agencies to do even more than what a regular user could in terms of missing pets by allowing them to create or implement their own databases of animals they have found and have them available for pet owners to browse.
