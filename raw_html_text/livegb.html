                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of ideas floating around about how to build more powerful programming environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can you edit the program while it's running?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can you have a debugger that remembers old states of your program, so you can scrub back and forth in time?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can you have the information you want at hand as you're editing and navigating the code -- runtime information, not just static source text?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Game Boy is interesting because it has some familiar software -- Pok&eacute;mon, Mario, and so on -- but it's a small enough system that you can do a lot of weird, inefficient tricks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has a 4 MHz processor and 8 KB of RAM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So if we want to go back in time, we can just copy the whole computer state; it's not a big deal!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A code editor and emulator appear in your browser. The whole development system runs in the browser, so you can edit and play without leaving your browser window.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You edit the Game Boy assembly on the left, and it reloads the ROM pretty much instantly on the right, as you're typing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I did
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote a completely new Game Boy assembler so it would run in the browser, so it would run fast enough to compile in real time, and so I could instrument the output properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The emulator is an existing JS Game Boy emulator (patched a little to support real-time ROM changes), and the demo is a small one-file demo someone wrote.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Future directions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smarter hot-swap (with a custom assembler and more emulator tools, we can track provenance of regions of RAM, etc). Or do input replay instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Track provenance of regions of display, so you click a pixel and it knows where it came from in the code.
                </p>
