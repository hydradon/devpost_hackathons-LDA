                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My wife was pregnant with my first daughter Ivie and I wanted my daughter to know me as i am now.  I wanted her to see me as im ambitious and energetic because i know i might get worn down by life.  I want to be remembered for my accomplishment and successes.  I want my family, and future family to know who i am even when im gone.  I want everyone to have this opportunity.
                </p>

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Timesent is a genealogy media and digital time capsule company.   We took the longevity of genealogy and the popularity of social media to create the perfect venue for everyone to leave behind the best of themselves; it will be like leaving the highlight reel of your life in the family tree for future generations to admire.  The Time Capsule features let the users store and send videos, pictures, and text messages that only open for specific people and at a specific time or location.
                    <br>
                    What would it be like to receive a video text message from your young mother and father that was made years prior, expressing their joy of your birth and leaving you some valuable advice?  Maybe a groom makes a video for his bride about his thoughts and feelings on their wedding day, and has the video send to each other&rsquo;s phone on their first anniversary. Memories are not timeless but with Timesent they can be.

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a great programmer build us some framework and hope that we can use the pitch money to build a custom website and app.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into questions, like how do you know you will be around in 50 years? And, what makes you different from Facebook.  We spent the better part of a year determining how to make the best product possible with all the feedback we received.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team.  I have an amazing hard working team that is willing to sacrifice their time, money, and talents to see Timesent through.  Its not just a company to us, its the way we can leave something special for the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the rising generation learn by watching videos, and communicate by making videos.  Yet we have no way of helping these rising generations learn from the past and communicate with the future.  We learned that parents go nuts over being able to show their kids their glory days.  We learned that this idea could help condition people to think more about their future, and more their future kids and grand kids.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Timesent has an amazingly bright future.  Timesent is the missing puzzle piece between social interaction and genealogical connection.  We are the combination of Facebook and Ancestry.  We will entertain the the younger generations and gratify genealogy enthusiast.  We are the future of social genealogy.
