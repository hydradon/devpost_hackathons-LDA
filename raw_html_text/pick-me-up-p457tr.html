                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by #trashtag and wanted to continue the benefits that we saw from this movement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app allows users to take a before and after photo of a polluted area that they clean up, earning in game points. If they rank well enough on the leader boards, they could get cash prizes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an express app and used node.js and html to build the back and front ends, respectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not know node.js, html, or how to use express.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We proud of the fact that we were able to make a cohesive application in the time frame with multiple restarts and not knowing almost anything about web app development beforehand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code node.js, html, css and how to correctly use api's from companies such as Google.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pick Me Up
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are considering making this a fully-fledged app and launching it on the play and app stores.
