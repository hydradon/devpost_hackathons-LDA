                <p>
                    Ensuring that our children are prepared for kindergarten and beyond, helping to close the achievement gap. Also, the amount of time children spend looking at screens, and the lack of quality content.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    That none of us are game developers... yet. The developers on the team come from full stack backgrounds, and attempting to create a native mobile game was quite challenging.

                    Our entire prototype! Our team rallied behind the idea, as we're all passionate about closing the achievement gap.

                    What we learned

                    We learned that we need to bring on board an experienced game developer.

                    Improving the MVP, creating a more realistic UI and the addition of VR, AR, and ML. We plan on expanding beyond preschool age content, in order to help all school age children. We've already partnered with a children's author to incorporate children's books into our curriculum.
