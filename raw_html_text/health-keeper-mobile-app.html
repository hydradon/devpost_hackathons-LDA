                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today's busy life, people often forget to take their daily medications and set appointments for
health checkups. According to a report, 50% of patients do not take medicines as prescribed
and 44 out of 100 prescriptions are never picked up at the pharmacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app helps in addressing these concerns. Like other medicare applications, the app lets you
set reminders for daily medications and daily exercise. However, unlike other applications, it
also lets you scan your medical records thereby reducing the need to maintain physical records.
It also lets you share your fitness achievements. This acts as a motivating factor for your friends
and family and keeps you motivated too.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prototype was designed on Figma and XD
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many medicare applications that exist today. So the team brainstormed on new features that can make the app interesting to use and that motivates users to record their daily fitness habits.
