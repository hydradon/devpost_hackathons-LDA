                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hate bad drivers. We love competing against each other.
Also, Jeff King for having an awesome hoodie.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app harnesses the data provided by the mojio OBD2 device, and analyses the data to provide users with a score for commutes that they can set up. Users can get higher scores for driving with better fuel efficiency than their average, or lose points for events like harsh braking or speeding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an Android app using Android Studio. Our app was integrated with the mojio REST API, Retrofit HTTP library, and Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's just say there were a lot.
The main one was navigating documentation for many different libraries and integrating different systems to work together with our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming together, meshing our strengths together, and trying to come up with something kind of functional after such a short and sleep-deprived period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons are super fun.
(also, working with HTTP libraries and integrating REST APIs with Android. but that's a little less important than fun)
                </p>
