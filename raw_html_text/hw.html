                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a simple but useful tool to highschool students, and I thought that a homework planner would be a fun idea, which students could use to keeo track of their homework. I also wanted to get more familiar with rust which is a newer language for me and build a fun project at a hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It keeps track of assignments or events on certain dates, with optional descriptions (and possibly subjects if I get that done). You can then see the assignments in chronological order, with the date of each group of events in a box. You can also remove/add assignments. SEE README on github for detailed instructions!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with rust and two other rust packages: chrono which keeps track of dates and rand which generates random numbers. I first worked on removing an event, which was the hardest, then adding an event, then displaying the events, and then finally getting the info on a certain event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge I ran into was how to properly remove an event. It was kept in a text file, with each text file being an event. However, modifying the file, and finding similar events that the user might want to delete was difficult, and reading and interpreting the file properly was difficult, as it kept running into type conversion problems
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the ls command of hw that shows all the events, because it looks very neat and tidy, and centered. I am also proud that I got the remove event command working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot more about file io, very simple databases and problems when using them, and writing config parsers for clis and generally a lot more about CLIs and the rust language overall.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for hw
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I might work on it more at home - polishing it to best practices with proper error handling, more features, etc.
