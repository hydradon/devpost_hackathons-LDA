                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today's digital age, kids aren't engaged with reading. They have mobile games, social media apps, and digital assistant apps that are really able to grasp and hold their attention. What if we could harness the power of "talking" to a virtual friend that would also be educational?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sentence Master is a multiple choice fill in the blank game for Alexa. It's perfect for kids who want to have a little more fun with reading. Using sentences from popular children's books, kids can improve their knowledge of contextual clues for sentence completion, word definitions, and grammar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this Alexa skill in Node.js using Claudia.js for testing and deployment. We gathered public domain children's books and used
                    <a href="https://github.com/parmentf/node-sentence-tokenizer" rel="nofollow">
                        sentence-tokenizer
                    </a>
                    to parse the books into sentences. Then we used
                    <a href="https://github.com/moos/wordpos" rel="nofollow">
                        WordPos
                    </a>
                    to get a noun from a random sentence in the book to replace with a blank and generated more words of varying parts of speech to use for the multiple choice answers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some issues getting Alexa to accept the word itself as an answer, as opposed to just answering "A", "B", "C", "D", but were finally able to work around this issue. We really wanted to give kids this option and make Alexa very flexible in what she will accept as an answer to prevent kids from getting frustrated while playing this game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allowing Alexa to be flexible in what answers she will accept and consider a match for the correct multiple choice answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to keep the game and interactions simple and fun at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sentence Master
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sentence Master has the ability of expanding greatly! It's possible to add micro-transactions to the app to add more children's books, so that the game is always fresh and fully of variety.
