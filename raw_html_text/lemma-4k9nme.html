                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Families are no longer organizing family reunions and even if they are in a family reunion they are actually distracted by technologies, even with facebook , instagram or any other social media service they still disconnected 
the idea is how to adapt a  platform for family only and use digital features to fix a problem caused by technology itself
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lemma allows you to : 
*reconnect your family members by creating your own family space 
*organize lemma by inviting your family members 
*turn  your phone onto  "mode lemma" and live the moment with your family
this mode disables notifications you receive on your phone and hide the facebook, instagram and snapshat... during the lemma 
*share posts in your family space 
*never miss a family gathering, birthday parties,weddings  by checking your lemma agenda 
*Parents can activate lemma mode on their children's devices remotly to have some time together 
*find out how much time you're spending with your family and check the lemma dashbord
                </p>

                <p>
                    A mobile social networking platform "lemma"
This application is developed with the cross platform xamarin forms with using the firebase service and the sqlLite DBMS for the lemma mode we intend to implement it with the notification service of Xamarin
