                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most bikes people own are usually sitting around collecting dust for the majority of the year. In fact, out of a 100 million American bike owners surveyed almost 50 million of them ride their bike at least twice a month. In addition, the second biggest reason people do not ride bikes is because they do not have a working bike (no brainer)! Our team wanted to figure out a solution to fix both these issues which ultimately ended up bring Bike Around.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bike Around allows people to rent bikes through a Peer to Peer environment. What this means is that bike owners have people rent out their bikes for an initial fee and then a flat rate dependent on how long you are renting the bike.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an Android mobile application to as out platform. In addition, we set a payment system for users that allows most popular banking services such as Chase!

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we ran into was figuring how to use some kind of payment api for our users. We initially were going to have a server set up until we found an android library!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about what is plaid and how to integrate it with Android native applications. We also learned how to create an aesthetically good looking front-end with interactive.
