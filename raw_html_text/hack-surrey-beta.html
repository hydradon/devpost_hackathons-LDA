                    We live in an 
age where the president of the united states, one of the most 
influential men in the world, has the power to send stock markets into 
shock at will by naming a company in his tweets. By analyzing the 
effects of his tweets on stock market prices, we can create data trends 
into the future to make predictions about what effect he potentially 
could have on industry stock were he to tweet about them again. 
Potentially, this could be used for a competitive edge in stock trading,
 as by being able to predict roughly the trend that stock prices could 
follow, buying and selling at the right time could lead to large 
profits.
