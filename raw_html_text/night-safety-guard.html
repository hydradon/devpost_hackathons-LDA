                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walking alone during night could be dangerous for children or female, my team wants to design a product that could help the disadvantaged group to notice people around for their unsettling situations such that they can get help from others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The alarming light will flash and the speaker will play alarming sound with a proper gesture as well as a specific sound inputs. My team is also planning to add bluetooth connection for the device with user's cell phone such that a signal will send to the cell phone and a message will send to the emergence contact if the device is triggered.  However, due to the problem of the adapter, we can not fully implement this function in our design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Touch sensor, sound sensor, gesture sensor and Arduino have been used in our design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We planned to have a Bluetooth to send out messages but the adapter did not work properly, so we had to give up that function temporarily. In addition, we also needed a speaker to make the alarm but unfortunately we did not have it. However, we will try next time when all the equipment are available. And we are improving our coding as well.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no background knowledge of the software and hardware parts related to this project. We learnt almost every relevant skills within one day time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a taste on almost every sensors in the dragon-board kits, such as sound sensor,gesture sensor, color sensor and touch sensor. During that process, we polish our ideas and know clearer what we are looking for by comparing with the confusion before the hackthon begun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Night Safety Guard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will implement the Bluetooth and speaker function.  In addition, the project will be more customized by asking users to input their preferred gestures to active the device.
