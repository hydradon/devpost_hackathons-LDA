                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mouldy bagels at work (CLEARBRIDGEMOBILE) made us think about all the food we buy, an amount of which we may forget about and waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To mitigate the problem mentioned above, we created an app that tracks the expiration dates of food items and notifies you when they are about to go bad. In addition, it also has a shopping list that can be populated through the list of items in your 'Fridge', so that it can be integrated into a user's routine, with plans to implement Speech-to-Text with Google Home or any other assistant.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Git being just... well, lets say, it took 10 commits to set up our repository, and leave it at that.
On another note, when trying to create a separate toolbar for each fragment in our main activity.
Implementing date filtering and comparators for the 'Fridge' fragment, also caused issues.
