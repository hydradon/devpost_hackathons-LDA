                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by text to speech and speech to text technology, now we need sign language to speech!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using python and Leap Motion, sign language can be interpreted into speech synthesis.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accuracy of motion tracking on Leap Motion is unfortunately lacking. Many times the sensor accurately sense the hand movements.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working by myself, tackling a language and library I've never used before and creating something out of it.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time using leap motion and python.
