                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from looking at the mountains for the first time for Emin and I. We wanted to do something with nature and we talked about how forest fires are a problem in some parts of the country. We decided we wanted to create something that could help detect a fire and felt Freewave technology could help with that. We told Andrew our idea and he was in it from the start, being a Coloradan and seeing wildfires destroying entire forests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is to use an Arduino with a temperature sensor to send temperature data to a client transmitter, which is then broadcast to the other radio. The radio would then post the data to a website. However, we did not have the hardware to make the connection between the Arduino and the transmitter. The two boards are able to communicate to each other from a distance and send each other manufactured data (since the Arduino cannot be connected). The receiver is supposed to send data to a database, which updates a webpage that displays the temperature data collected, and refreshes every minute to grab the latest value from the database/receiver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the system by using Freewave technology and programmed the radios using python. We uploaded our python programs into the boards to have the client (sender) board run without being connected to the computer while the server (listener) side would listen for the information sent and send it to the computer/database. The server side remains plugged into a computer so it can display the transmitted data.
The Arduino used a shield to plug in the sensors. We use resistance-based temperature sensors so the analog data was converted to actual temperature values.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MOSQUITTO MOSQUITTO MOSQUITTO. Enough said...but also, MySQL does not run well on the radios, which prevented us from being able to update a database and website in real-time. In addition to that, we did not have a way of connecting the Arduino to the radio, which prevents us from using real data for a demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an IOT system that can work at very long ranges. The radios are able to transmit data from another room, which shows that there is no wired connection between the radios. We are also proud that we were able to use new technology that we had no knowledge in.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make python executable on devices, how to transmit data across a network, and improved our knowledge of databases. Also, hackathons are really fun and free food is great!

                    What's next for Straight Fire

                <p>
                    To be able to finish the project and have it finally have sensors attached to it and transmit data to a database that a webpage can grab.
