                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to make an iOS game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Has a fancy login screen-- but no back-end functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Swift (and powerpoint)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to connect the app with the Microsoft API, Azure
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trucking through tutorials in an attempt to figure out how to connect the app with the Microsoft API (and other API's as well).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need mentors to help explain how to link an iOS app with an API. You can also make some pretty great powerpoints given a couple of hours.
                </p>

                    What's next for the-little-things
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figure out how to link with API-- or really any sort of database management system.
                </p>
