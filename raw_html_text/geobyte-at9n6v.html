                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides the user with the Yelp Page of the current establishment they're in with the press of one button.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native along with Expo, implementing the Yelp Fusion API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we all started none of us had ever used React Native and none of us are exactly Javascript experts either, so as you can imagine there was some bumps along the way.  The hardest challenge was starting; we didn't know how to get our foot in the door.  We threw ideas around for hours and this seemed to be the most plausible app that a group of beginners could develop together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering all of us came in here as first time "hackers" and first time React Native users, I'd say we're all pretty proud that we were able to put out a finished product.  It may not be the most innovative idea in the world, or the best put together app, but the fact it works and we got it here is pretty awesome.  This definitely motivates us all to learn more and probably participate in future Hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A basic understanding of React Native and that you don't have to be an expert in programming or app development to put something together as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GeoByte
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly we feel that GeoByte might have its uses in the future, but it's in a pretty primitive stage right now, so we'll just stick to trying to optimize it and adding new features.
