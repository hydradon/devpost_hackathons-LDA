                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One i was chatting with my friend on fb and we were unable to watch a youtube video together as our video played at different time. That was when I have an idea of creating a platform for people to watch videos or listen to music, ... together without having to time it themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let people watch video at same timing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use react native for front end and Firebase as a server to sychronize their timing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced a lot of problems with the youtube plugin and how to organize the structure on Firebase
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to overcome the bug in the youtube plug in by implement its features ourselves
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase management
                </p>

                    What's next for TogetherTube
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can have browsing videos from different channels, connecting videos to youtube, connect through bluetooth instead of wifi
                </p>
