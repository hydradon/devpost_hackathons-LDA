                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people are disadvantages in the workforce as they do not have sufficient web developing experience to create portfolios.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates original responsive portfolio websites that are generated from a resume.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I utilized HTML, CSS, Javascript, and several APIs in order to create this product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Visual Studio, the program we used to develop our program, didn't function for 3 hours. Additionally, we were tired and sick as we took the early morning bus from Chicago.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some members of my group were not as familiar with frontend development, and through this project their eyes were opened to a new side of programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that no matter how confident you may be that your idea will go as planned, it won't.
                </p>

                    What's next for EasyRez

                <p>
                    We plan to continue to expand and further utilize neural networks in order to deliver the best content to our users.
