                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Django for back-end, Auth0 for authentification and HTML&amp;CSS for front-end.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing a database with different models (users, questions, answers).
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to organize and manage the development of a real-world platform, which could turn out to be really useful.
                </p>

                    What's next for StacsOverflow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding it to the whole department online and many other universities after, such that CS students could get help each other. Also, our platform could employ a competition (e.g. user of the month), where the most active users would win points for giving out correct answers, motivating students to work harder.
