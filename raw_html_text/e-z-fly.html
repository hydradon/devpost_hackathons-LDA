                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired due to past experiences of taking part in air travel. We both have had noticed many flaws with air travel and making it a great experience for the traveler. We found that creating this application would accommodate for all of the troubles that travelers may run into. The app enhances the traveler experience inside and outside of the plane.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates easy access to purchasing a flight, as well as seating, navigating your way through the airport, being alerted of the status of your flight, hotel booking, shuttle/parking prices, location of your plane, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We combined our skillset of adobe photoshop, illustrator and in design in order to create a prototype of the app, E-Z FLY. We found that our superpowers were similar but stronger in different areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It became difficult to do our research on how to actually purchase a plane ticket, being only 18 years of age and never flying alone. Figuring out time zones &amp; how to make it easier for air travelers to get on their way was another obstacle. We weren't aware of how to actually program the app itself, so we utilized the skills we had and put it to good use by creating the prototype itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing an application that is user-friendly and time-efficient for any traveler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are more capable than we thought from the beginning, but we could have budgeted our time more efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for E-Z FLY
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully securing the funds and tools necessary to further the development of the user-friendly application. Create an easy access for any air traveler to utilize at their own expense to enhance their personal experience booking a plane ticket.
