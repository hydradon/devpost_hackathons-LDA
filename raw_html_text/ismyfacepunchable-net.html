Seriously, why is his face so punchable?

                    Haven't you ever wondered if your beautiful face could be punchable, but are too afraid to ask a stranger? We did. So we made this to answer your undying question.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses OpenCV and some Haar Cascading Classifiers to compare your face with hundreds of punchable and non-punchable faces throughout reddit. This is really innovative technology here. Also React.js is cool.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We actually wanted to leave pretty much as soon as we got here but it's -20 degrees outside and it's like a 20 minute walk to anywhere remotely near civilization so we just had to deal I guess.

                    We have (scientifically?) proven Martin Shkreli's face is super punchable.

                    Itai's face is not punchable! Please don't disqualify us!
