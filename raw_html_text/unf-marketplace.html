                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I purchased a textbook for $50 from Amazon. When I tried to sell it, I only got $10. I realized that if I had sold it to another student, they would have been willing to pay more than $10
                    <em>
                        and
                    </em>
                    they would have also saved money by not going through Amazon or the UNF bookstore, which is a win-win scenario. However, the problem was that there was no popular forum that would allow me to connect to buyers, or vise-versa.

                    We ran into challenges while developing both the frontend and backend. I developed the backend, while my friend developed the frontend.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I am proud of having built the backend (albeit incomplete) because I knew nothing about the frameworks I was using, and hardly any JavaScript. After suffering through hour-long documentation greps, I learned more about the Node.js serverless ecosystem than I was expecting to.

                    We will for sure continue to work on this app after the Hackathon, as our MVP prototype gave us an idea of what directions to take our concept in.
