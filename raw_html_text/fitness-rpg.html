                    None of our members attended Hackpoly without having a set team nor a specific project idea that we wanted to work on. We met during team formation, sat down together and decided on what platform we all felt comfortable working on -- we all agreed to work with Android. The next step was to figure out what we wanted to create. Luckily we all were interested in working on a sort of game that is in one way or another connected to our actual lives. Fitness RPG is essentially a roll-playing game that creates an avatar (reflecting the users) allowing us to choose a class (athlete, programmer, couch-potato, engineer, or nurse) gaining unique attributes for each character. The idea extended to being able to gain experience (which in turn meant levels) as well as attributes by completing tasks in real life to build on to your avatar which then could be used to battle other users. Our main ideas for tasks were involving using pedometer to increase attributes such as stamina, strength, and speed -- whilst answering correctly on trivia would gain us intelligence points. We also entertained the idea of allowing users to create parties and complete tasks together for additional rewards. Unfortunately, the scope of our idea was bigger than we expected in relation to our capabilities and stamina -- but we did nonetheless have a great time working on this project where everyone was involved and constantly learning.
