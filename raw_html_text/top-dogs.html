                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to address the issue of mobility for soldiers when it comes to lugging around extremely heavy weights. One issue we heard from a field operative was that the terrain is extremely unpredictable, making it difficult to navigate/travel on missions.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product will map out a topographical map and indicate the best route for foot operatives to take based on elevation and shortest distance to travel.
                </p>
