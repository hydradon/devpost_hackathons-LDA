                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The holidays are supposed to be the happiest time of the year. Time time for cheer and giving gifts. However getting those gifts to give can suck all the cheer right out of you and fast! This is why you we felt the need to use the AI capabilitys of AWS to detect if the parking lot is full or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows smart cars with alexa built in or a person with the alexa app the ask if the the parking lot
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also has a seperate skill that allows a different type of user (ie law enforcement) to find a car via plate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did a lot of peer programming to get it all done in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we had some issues with the api call of Recognition using the detect_text() api call. We also had some issues sharing the images to test in a public bucket between the team, and this seems to be from some of the newer security issues that have been added to S3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used multiple pieces of the Recognition SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned quite a bit about the scoring and labeling of different images with AWS Rekognition.

                    What's next for parking-finder

                <p>
                    Next would be adding in a Dynamo DB to add Geo spatial lookups from the user side as well as
