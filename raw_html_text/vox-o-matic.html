                    Inspiration : I have been fascinated with Mine-craft style graphics- it's a world of voxels! So, I decided to write a voxelizer that would turn any CAD model into voxels. I had created a stand-alone application earlier. When I heard about this hackathon, I decided to use the library I had written to create an app for Fusion360.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does : It breaks down a CAD model into tiny cubes called voxels.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it : I wrote a library in C++
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into : Choosing the right settings so that the CAD model is correctly approximated by the voxels. The challenges were mostly on the voxelizaion part.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of : A working app for Fusion360 that can voxellize any CAD model that can be created or imported into Fusion360!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned : A good deal about the Fusion API, as well as about writing a voxelizer.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Vox-O-Matic : Currently I haven't exposed much functionality; it's just a select and click kind of thing. I would expose more controls to the user, such as voxelizing just a face(instead of a complete body), letting the user decide the resolution at which to voxelize.
