                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The relation between mental illness and the internet was brought up many times both in the academic platform and in social media. I found research was quite interesting from Missouri University of Science and Technology partner with Microsoft. The research pointed out that people who have anxiety would use the Internet differently. I will give a quick number based on the research. If you frequently switch among Internet applications such as e-mail, chat rooms, and games; you are 30% more likely to have depression symptoms.
another aspect we considered when developing the idea was people are lazy to keep track of their mental health.  Thus, it would be great if there a tool or an app can cut down all the laziness and reach to users seamlessly

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    chrr blssm is a chrome extension that helps users keep track of their mood and give suggestions materials to boost user mood. A message will pop-up every day when users open their chrome with a question that relates to their mental health. Users just need to choose the answer that relevant to their mood, then we will provide suggestions.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Javascript and CSS  to create the chrome extension

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    We tried to figure out how can we manipulate the DOM tree for creating a unique popup like the infobox

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We all knew nothing about chrome extension beforehand, but we've managed to create a product together.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We could not get the data from local storage. We were thinking to create Firebase database as an alternative but we did not have time for figuring out about integration.

                <p>
                    We want to corporate the mood data with browser history, tag users activities with negative and positive tags, analyze the dataset to find trends, and detect the negative path using machine learning
