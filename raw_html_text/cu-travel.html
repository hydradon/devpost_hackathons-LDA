                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is inspired by my friend Sophy Zhou and also my experience when planning a trip to California, I have to either switch among pages to make a plan or rely on the automatic travel planner which generates a typical "tourist" itinerary for almost everyone. It seems I have to make a decision between "troublesome" and "boring". NO! That's why we came up with the idea of CU Travel.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CU Travel is a web application to help design travel itinerary for solo or group. Individual can start a trip and add collaborators to plan trip together. For single user, he start a trip by adding basic information about the trip, e.g. origin, destination, start date, number of days and size of group. With the basic information, a group of users can select the Point of Interest (POI) they would like to visit and map those POIs to the map. The map would generate an optimal route for users, and then the users can set breakpoints on the route as to divide the route to each traveling day. Finally, CU Travel would automatically generate an initial trip itinerary for users. Users can add more details to it.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this web application using Django and deployed it using Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three of us have no experience with Django, we learned and played with it in 24 hours. 
The logic of this trip planner is not that straightforward, it took us some time to figure out the feasible solution for it.

                    Impossible mission completed.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The logic design is important when developing the web application. We achieved it in an incremental way.
