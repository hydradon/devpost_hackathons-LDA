                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jill's brother is a hearing impaired individual and recently received his driving license. His family and friends had serious concerns about his ability to react to emergency vehicles such as police cars, ambulances, or fire trucks approaching behind him.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Respon-dash is unique product that utilizes a visual alerting system. Using a light sensor, Respon-dash's outer component is on the look out for flashing lights, like those from a police car, behind the vehicle. If flashing lights are detected, then it sends a 'ping' to Respon-dash's inner component, which flashes briefly in the driver's peripheral vision, alerting them to a potential situation that they may need to respond to. Respon-dash's inner component is as easily placed the same way as many popular air fresheners- by clipping it to an air vent. Respon-dash's outer component is placed on the outside of the vehicle using a magnet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Respon-dash is built with two Arduino Unos, a pair of NRF24L01 wireless modules, a photo resistor, and a Neo Pixel Indicator LED.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some major challenges we ran into included learning how to interface with the NRF24L01 modules and extract data given an analog sensor output of the photocell.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jill is proud of the fact that we were able to develop and nearly patent able product within 36 hours. 
Michael is proud of the fact that we were able to troubleshoot hardware effectively with mentors,was able to teach Jill something about electronics, and nothing released magic smoke.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned alot about how to interface the Arduino software with the NRF24L01 modules through the SPI protocol. 
Jill learned how to work comfortably with Arduino, circuit boards, and how to practically troubleshoot electronics and improve soldering skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Respon-Dash
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps for Respon-Dash would be to try and bring it to market and obtain a provisional patent on such an idea.
