                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the fandom of the SSV Jahn Regensburg has been growing for years now, fans have experienced less feeling of belonging together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you buy a ticket for a game, you can choose to join the Jahn car sharing community. You can either be driver or passenger and find people from your region who also plan to go to the same game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Especially for away games, you can also search for people who might pass your village on their way and contact them to make the journey together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we talked to some people from the Jahn about how people buy their tickets to get a better understanding of the process. Afterwards, we designed a paper prototype of how such a system could be integrated into the current web shop with user login. After testing this prototype, we built an HTML mockup for the whole process and asked some fans what they think about the system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we have no direct access to the system, we could only build the frontend. Thereby it was the essential decision at the beginning whether to build an app or a webapp or something completely different. We needed to understand how fans might fell about a car sharing functionality, what data they might want to provide or not and then find the best way to get people to accept the solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we managed to integrate our functionality concept into the existing web shop. This is an advantage, as the Jahn webshop is managed by an external provider who is also managing the ticket sales for other clubs - they could also use the system. 
Second, the user does not have to create an extra account or give data to any other provider, as every ticket buyer automatically has a Jahn webshop account. Still, for better connection with other Jahn fans, there is the possiblity to enter more data into a personal car sharing profile. This is no requirement though.
An important point with our approach is, that no user automatically gets any data of other users. In a personal message to the respective driver, passengers can decide on their own how they want to get in touch. This seemed the best solution to us especially when you asume that fans from the same region might already know each other. 
Last, we managed to create a very simple flat design. There is not too much functionality to make the process as easy and accessible as possible for all fans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to prototype efficiently with lean UX and improved our understanding of what is important to focus on when you have only limited time to present your idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jahn-Family
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A next step is to start testing the system with more Jahn fans online. Before integrating the system into the webshop, it is utterly important to get data on how fans accept a Jahn car sharing community in real life. Therefore the Jahn might want to integrate a lean version of the system onto their own website to see if people want to use it. As a first step they could match fans manually and see, if it works. In case of positive feedback, the external ticket seller could then integrate the system into their webshop to improve user experience. Apart from that, the site needs to be made responsive.
