                        Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    Archetype Solutions proposed a healthcare problem for us to solve. The big idea is basically to help people be healthier without having to always go directly to their physician's office. By allowing physicians easier access to their patients current data, millions of dollars can be saved by preventing future doctor trips. Our idea consists of allowing doctors to be able to receive updates on whether their patient is taking their pills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        What it does
                    </strong>
                    Our program produces a .cvs file that contains the patient's pill taking information (what pills, how many pills, when to take the pills), simulates the patient taking a pill, updates the .cvs file with information on which pill the patient took at what time, and then graphs the information as a line graph (pill vs. time)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        How we built it
                    </strong>
                    We used python to write the code to create the .cvs file and simulate the patient taking a pill. We used java to create a graphing application for the doctor to view the patient's history of pill taking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Challenges we ran into
                    </strong>
                    We initially wanted to create a pill dispenser, with a raspberry pi, that has a button for the patient to press and a pill would be released. The pressing of the button would then go then create a .cvs file and upload that to Google Drive as a spreadsheet which the doctor can see. However, the shop building was closed at the time and so we were unable to access the necessary supplies to do so. The Google Drive API was too complex to figure out within our time span and we couldn't get it to work in the Java. We still wanted to keep the same idea so we simply simulated the patient taking a pill and had direct transfer through SSH between the "patient's pill dispenser" and the physician.

                    <strong>
                        Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </strong>
                    We're proud that we were able to finish the project with some major setbacks in our original design. We were able to simply mimic a patient taking a pill and graph the results based on a .cvs file.

                <p>
                    <strong>
                        What we learned
                    </strong>
                    We learned a little bit about how the Google Drive API works, though it is still very complex to learn and it takes a long time to figure out. We learned about the usefulness of Unix and SSH and how they can work
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        What's next for Pills MD
                    </strong>
                    We'd like to implement our initial design and have a pill dispenser set and connect the doctor to the patient via Google Drive.
