                    With the rise of climate change efforts and the increasing trend of eco-conscious consumers, hundreds of brands are now offering environmentally friendly products and services to help customers decrease their environmental impact. From reusable grocery bags, clean beauty, to 100% compostable phone cases, there are eco-friendly alternatives for almost anything. However, with so many new options of one product, it may be overwhelming to decide on a brand best suits the customers&rsquo; needs.

                    Smart Shop is a one stop online shop that holds sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives for anything you can think of. It&rsquo;s a convenient way for consumers to purchase on one single platform. Eliminating the barrier of researching products on their own, users will be able to compare products easily based on price, material, size, and customer ratings. Because fast delivery/shipping is harmful to the environment, the app will suggest locally made products to the user whenever they search for something. This way, with more local goods being bought, we&rsquo;ll be able to deliver items quickly because transporting local goods can meet customer expectations of one-two day shipping without harming the environment.

                    No one on our team knew how to make an Android App so today was the first time for us all using Android Studio. There was definitely a learning curve, however, we slowly got the hang of it and was able to finish this app.
