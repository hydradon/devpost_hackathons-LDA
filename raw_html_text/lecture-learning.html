                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being in a classroom or workshop setting it most of the time, this app aims to improve the performance for both the instructor and the students. For the students it allows them to electronically ask the teacher to slow down their presentation. For the instructors they are able to immediately understand the student's understanding of the material during the lecture and they are able to go over the feedback after to improve their presentation for next time.
