                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I find the idea of pitching metrics really fascinating. I wanted to build an app that would give me more information on batters and how pitchers pitch to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user can choose a pitcher and a batter, and see how a pitcher has pitched to that batter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next.js with node backend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Graphing libraries are hard! Getting the styling right was difficult. Also, massaging the data to be consumed by the API took time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to write a full stack app in a day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about what data sources I could use to make this app happen. It took quite a while to find the correct data sources.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pitcher Batter Matchup
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More data visualizations, and perhaps a "lookalike" pitcher feature to find players who are similar.
