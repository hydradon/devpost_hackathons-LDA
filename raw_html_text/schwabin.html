                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into the weekend, we decided that we would take a look at the various challenges/technologies and to the best of our abilities, create a hack that utilized multiple technologies.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to find their exact location via their smartphone and the vehicle's location and determines if they are in the same location without actually providing coordinates for the phone in order to protect user privacy.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this mobile application with Java, Python, Android-Studio, Flask, and Smartcar's API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we discussed Microsoft's azure being heavily integrated into the application, but as we made progress we realized that it did not seem as necessary as it was initially perceived to be and so it was eventually cut from the hack. This was a challenge because we had to change what the main focus of the app was and we landed on the location of the smartphone relative to the location of the vehicle would be the direction we would go in.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Our team consists of four members, and of those four members, it is two of our members' first hack-a-thon. And, this is my second hack-a-thon, and this is the remaining member's third hack-a-thon. None of us had ever submitted a hack before so that in itself is an accomplishment that we are all proud of. In regards to the technologies used, we are especially proud that we

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work in a team when it comes to computer science and how to divide up the workload so that no two people are doing the same thing twice. This can be a very tedious cycle and there are plenty of moments where you will not know what you are doing and will want to give up, but we kept each other going by encouraging one another. We also let one or two people rest at a time so that there was always someone as fresh as they could be and there was always someone working on the hack. Unless of course, we each went to breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We intend to attend more hack-a-thons in the future. And we each intend on taking the lessons we've learned home and keep building from there.
