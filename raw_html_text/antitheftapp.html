                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my friend's laptop got stolen in India. He registered a complaint but was unable to recover his laptop. As a cyber security student it struck me and inspired me to develop something to help him. So, I decided to make an Antitheft App which is simple yet effective, requires less dependencies yet do the work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here in HackRU, I created say the first draft of the Antitheft App. It includes a key logger and public IP tracker that will help us to determine the location of stolen laptop. It will send the recorded keystroke and the current public IP to the predefined email address without user's attention.We can specify the time length to send the log file and IP address.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built simply by using python 2.7.15. It uses existing python libraries like pyhook, pythoncom and smtp. So, there are no other dependencies at all. I used urllib2 and icanhazip.com to retrieve the public ip address.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have the working app which I can use anywhere, anytime. Because I built it, there are no trust issues. So, I literally developed a  'Hack' in 'Hack'RU :P

                <h2>
                    What's next for AntitheftApp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am planning to use google maps api to accurately detect the IP location. Also, we can add more features like video recording, screenshot capturing etc
