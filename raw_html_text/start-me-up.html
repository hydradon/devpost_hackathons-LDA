                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through our app, small business owners around the United States will be able to share anonymous information, such as balance sheets, income statements, expense reports, etc. Through integrations with other services such as PayPal Marketing Solutions, Quickbooks, Shopify, Google Analytics, and Salesforce, we are able to combine industry information to help new business owners make profitable decisions.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to convert the XLSX to CSV. Java was used to search the CSV for data points and normalize the data fields for a specific industry. HTML and CSS to build to theoretically host the service.

                    Our biggest challenge was not having a diverse team of developers.
