                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the US disposes of
                    <strong>
                        100 million pounds
                    </strong>
                    of tire components that are rejected during the manufacturing process. With no efficient means of recycling, tire companies are relegated to simply throwing these materials into landfills or incinerators. We looked to stop this environmental damage by creating a tech that can recycle these rejected materials so efficiently that it made economical sense for tire companies to responsibly dispose of their waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a series of trade secret technologies, we extract the rubber out of the #1 and #2 body plies that are rejected during the tire manufacturing process. This unvulcanized rubber is of the highest quality in the rubber industry, thus salvaging it from these unused components allows us to provide prime base material to rubber product makers at a exceedingly competitive price.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far we've received $8,000 in total funding from 3 different competitions hosted on the University of California San Diego campus. Currently, we have developed a small proof of concept that has verified the potential in our technology.

                    Challenges we're facing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Producing a larger, scalable prototype is proving to be quite the challenge. Our team has limited fabrication experience regarding the demands of this project. Designing the prototype is straightforward enough, however putting the design into practice is often restricted by our limited capacity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ReViSe (Resonant Vibrational Separation)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presently, we're designing and attempting to complete a large-scale prototype of our tech. At the same time, we are mapping out our plan of attack for raising funds. Following this, we will be designing and launching our factory operation, with a fully functional processing plants looking to be up and running by 2018.
