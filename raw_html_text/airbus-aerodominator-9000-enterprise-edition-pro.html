                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the welcoming talk, AirBus gave an idea on which we picked up, since we thought this project was innovative, it has a real life application and allowed us to learn and research new technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a web app (which could easily be extended into a phone app with a little bit more time) which allows a user to order an environmentally friendly air-taxi-helicopter.
Then the request is handled by an API server, and then the data is outputted to a unity simulator to demonstrate how the flight would look like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in blood, sweat and tears. We haven't slept and we did our best. We researched and worked hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sleepiness, bugs (a lot of bugs)  and not knowing the technologies and henceforth the need to learn them on the go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting our projects to work together in a team, and learning new skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That a group can achieve much more than an individual, API, Unity and that staying awake for 36 hours is not such a challenge after all.
                </p>

                    What's next for Airbus AeroDominator 9000 Enterprise Edition Pro ++
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improvements, improvements and a lot of improvements. Hopefully it will catch an eye of AirBus :)
