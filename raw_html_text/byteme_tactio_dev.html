                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presented the challenge by Tactio, our team was motivated to solve the problem using our experience in life sciences and machine learning.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Searches the database for entries and uses machine learning to categorize them into one of five categories of diagnoses: diabetes/hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, infection, or healthy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created a python script to obtain JSON files from the given database, containing patient data. These files were then partitioned into a separate dataset, with a cluster algorithm being run on these subsets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obtaining the data from the database proved difficult, as did tweaking the algorithm to get ideal results.
