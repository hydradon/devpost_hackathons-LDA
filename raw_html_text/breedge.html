                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People love watching other peoples lives every day &ndash; think Youtube, Snapchat, Instagram. We feel like these people are part of our lives even though this one-to-many communication is very one-way. Almost like a real life friend that doesn&rsquo;t talk back to us. What kind of friend is that?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Breedge you can become more involved and enjoy a better community feeling by easily having conversations with people you may have only had a 1-way friendship with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Breedge allows everyone to have a conversation with people who have many followers by only showing popular messages and allowing group voting responses.
