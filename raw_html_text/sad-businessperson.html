                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think about how people can learn from the past experience. Goals: By having the single player play the role of a businessman of a corporation, the player will realize how their actions can affect the environment when they are only focused on profit. Since this has been progressively happening over history, we believe this game is educational in terms of environmental protection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A web-based game where a single player plays the role of a businessman of a corporation and tries to use the resources (e.g. money) available to expand his or her business by making decisions about development strategies (e.g. public relations, "bribe", advertisement, product quality, etc. and how they influence the the environment when they are only focused on profit) and building factories around the world. While the goal for the player is to make money and eventually destroy the entire environment, the purpose of the game is educational - we would like to remind people of the impact of their current actions on the future of the environment by letting them experience the past. This game is intended to raise awareness of environmental protection.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble loading external script into our React-based project. Although in demo we get by it by manually writing a script to fetch and load it, it is not the best result we anticipated. In addition, we could not finish all the features we thought of in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the product we are able to present to you. It is a well-designed web-based game and incorporates artistic elements, which we believe will be engaging to the audience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to design a project from scratch, learn new technologies on the spot and interact as a newly-formed team to work on a project. We also learnt that developing a product is not easy - there are never enough features and tradeoffs to think about, decisions to make and code to write :) but we all thought that we enjoyed the process.
                </p>

                    What's next for sad businessperson
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to finish the features we did not have time to finish, such as message box and a more convenient map. We would also like to complication the game state by adding various raw products that have different degrees of influence on the environment. We would also like to make it a multi-player game and incorporate interactions between players and the governments and NGOs in the "world."
Also we are halfway done the using SQL cloud to save all the user information and game status. We'll implement it in the future.
