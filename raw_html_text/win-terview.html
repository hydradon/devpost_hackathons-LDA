                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students applying for internships and jobs, one of the biggest challenges we face was acing interviews. Besides the answers to interview questions, one big factor on whether you will pass the interview are the non-verbal cues and how well you can deliver your speech. This was something so important yet not formally taught in school. Hence we decided to build a web application to help students improve their interview skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Win-Terview helps students practice and improve their interview skills by providing them mock interviews, and live feedback on their answers based on non-verbal cues and speech delivery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The facial recognition is done by using Google Cloud Platform Vision API.
The voice recognition is done by using Google Cloud Platform Speech-to-text API
The video recording is stored on google cloud storage, and then accessed by our python programs that implemented the Google APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For front-end stack, we used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery to build the website. From the front-end, it used RestAPI to upload the video data and retrieve analysis results back to display the interview score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We wanted to analyze tone of voice in the text but we did not have enough time to scope that out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Insufficient time to do proper research on the specific verbal and non-verbal cues which gives interviewers a good impression. This made our product not as holistic as we wanted it to be.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Using Google Cloud&rsquo;s Vision API and Speech-to-Text tool, we managed to build a multi-dimensional tool that could read facial cues and evaluate speech delivery, and offer immediate feedback to users too. We built a product which we would all use and that&rsquo;s awesome!
-Users are also able to playback the video of themselves answering the interview questions, and get relevant tips for specific areas which they need improvement in.

                    -We learnt that Google Cloud actually provides a wide variety of tools and APIs which could be useful in a wide variety of projects
