                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a group of friends, interested in technology and new challenges.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project offers a different way of interaction within a Virtual Reality enviroment through Computer Vision and and intercomunication between diferent components of the system.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Project is built over to different platforms:
The first one is
                    <strong>
                        Unity
                    </strong>
                    , a 3D Game Engine with the integration of the
                    <strong>
                        HTC Vive
                    </strong>
                    and the
                    <strong>
                        Logitech VRInk
                    </strong>
                    . 
The second one is
                    <strong>
                        Python and OpenCV
                    </strong>
                    , to handle computer vision. 
Both platforms are
                    <em>
                        connected with a database, specificaly Firebase
                    </em>
                    , using the REST endpoints it provides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first and obvious challenge was the
                    <strong>
                        performance of the system
                    </strong>
                    . We had to use two different computers to launch each of the parts to solve this problem. 
As a result we faced another problem, which was the
                    <strong>
                        communication between computers
                    </strong>
                    . We have had to give performance and precision in exchange of an easy way of perform that communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of being able of integrating many different areas and technologies to offer an intuitive and different way of interaction in a attractive enviroment.
