                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes when hanging out with friends, it's hard to make plans because you don't know when people are free or you can't decide on what to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Friends allows you to update you status, letting your friends know when you're free or busy. It also lets you see the status of your friends and message them so you can coordinate activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML for the framework, CSS for the design, and javascript to locally store user input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally planned on making this into an Android App, but after struggling a lot with Android Studios, we changed our plan to a mobile website. We also have no previous experience with HTML or CSS, which set us back a lot since we had to take the time to learn the languages first, and were therefore short on time to implement other functionalities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we managed to go from knowing no HTML or CSS to making an entire website within 1 day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a little bit about Android Apps, and a lot of HTML and CSS. We also learned how websites are made and how to use inspect and console elements to edit things in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Friends
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan add a function that allows you to add friends based on their username. We also need to implement the username and password labels so they actually check the accuracy and take you to the correct account. We also need to add a logout button. There's so much, my friends.
