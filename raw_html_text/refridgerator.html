                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My mom always nags me to eat the string cheese, lunchmeat, or bread that's going bad in the refrigerator. Now I can track what items are at their end of life and eat them before the nagging gets worse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It sends you push notifications telling you to eat your food. One of the pages also tells you your wasted food converted to what you paid for it to encourage smarter and more efficient shopping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio was too difficult so we went with React Native and SQLite for local storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio ate up half of the time we were competing at HackNC because of how clunky and unintuitive it is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's actually useful for me in daily life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't use Android Studio for prototyping apps.
                </p>
