                    Karma is an image recognition software built using the Clarifai API. The goal is to take images of a car and quickly assess damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This solution could be applied to a multitude of technologies, including used car sales, insurance, damage assessment, and car repair. For our purposes we chose to use Karma in a selling platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What makes Karma truly remarkable is not only its ability to assess damage at a much faster rate then a human could, but also its ability to learn and improve with every time it assesses an image (in our situation this is done by simply asking the user to verify, but there are much more efficient ways of doing this.) What this means is that Karma is able to learn from its past successes and failures, and become more proficient the more it is used. In the long run this means that Karma could out pace its human counterparts in speed and accuracy
