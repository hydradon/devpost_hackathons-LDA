                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by talking to American Airlines gate agents working about their most challenging problems that affect their performance and customer satisfaction.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution works by having a QR code at every gate. The code can be used by American Airlines Passengers to get their frequently asked questions answers as well as be provided flight information without the need to talk to gate agents. This improves the customer experience while also freeing up time for gate agents to focus on the more pressing issues of the flight during the 25-50 minute timeslots before departure.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product was built using HTLM, CSS, Javascript and Json

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges we ran into was clarifying that we were solving a real problem faced by gate agents that could be solved in a way that was both cost-effective and improved customer satisfaction

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to find and to talk to customer-facing American Airlines employees such as Gate Agents and Customer Service Managers within the short 24-hour time constraints of the hack-a-thon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is important to match the skills of the team and the technology available with the real-world problems of employees and customers. One without the other leads to inadequate solutions.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our next step, we would like to continue to work with American Airlines gate agents, customers, and more to refine the solution and explore real-world implementation.
