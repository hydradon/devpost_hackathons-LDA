                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the forest fires that often occur around us, both in Indonesian forests and in the Amazon forests and others. therefore I hope the Bakpiaku game can contribute to reviving the spirit of planting trees again from one of the special foods and favorite foods that come from Indonesia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bakpiaku games work together with volunteers and nature lovers to replant trees that have been burnt by forest fires. the more points that have been collected from the game player the more he also contributes to planting trees, with 100 points he can plant 1 tree seed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this with spark ar software to make the game. and I will work with volunteers to jointly plant tree seedlings with the help of this game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the challenge I face is that I'm still a beginner in learning spark ar games. I hope in the future I can be more proficient in learning this software so that my game can be realized and so that this game is useful for our shared forest
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    a very proud achievement if I contribute to protect our forests together with this game that I made
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned many things in this challenge. first I can learn to make games with spark ar, and secondly I try to be a useful person for our forest from the games that I made
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bakpiaku
                </h2>
                <p>
                    henceforth I hope that from this game we are equally motivated to keep our forests in order to avoid forest fires returning, and furthermore this game will be made as attractive as possible so that it becomes a game that is in great demand by all circles and can benefit us all
