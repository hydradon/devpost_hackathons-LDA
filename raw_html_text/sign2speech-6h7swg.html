                    We are using a leap motion, a basic HTML page, and a Raspberry Pi 3 which is mounted to a user using 3D printed clips. The leap motion video signal is sent to a desktop computer for image recognition and uses machine learning to recognize user's signs. The prototype is in a "wearable" form factor.

                <p>
                    We leveraged LeapTrainer and open source project for motion recognition on the leap. We hope to further train the system to understand more ASL words and phrases.
