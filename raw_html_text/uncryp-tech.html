                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The censorship and intimidation of an entire group of people is something that we hope to never experience in our lives. With movements like #ArabSpring, #BlackLivesMatter, and more, we see that messages can have a great impact on our lives. One of our teammates, Ebou, was part of our inspiration for this application. He told us of how even messaging something poor about the leadership in Gambia would do unspeakable things to their own citizens.
With the increasing awareness of our lack of privacy and the extra security we would be better off with, we wanted to create a free alternative for people to message their loved ones securely, to share knowledge freely. We set out to solve this issue by creating a global application that could be applied in most methods of today's modern community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our system provides a modernly simple UI and intuitive API to help people
                    <strong>
                        encrypt their messages
                    </strong>
                    . Every user gets their own
                    <em>
                        private
                    </em>
                    and
                    <em>
                        public
                    </em>
                    key and they send messages across whatever platform they wish to with the knowledge and ease that only the person who it was meant to be sent to will receive the message.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are running a NodeJS Express server for the API calls on MongoDB with Angular as a front-end catalyst for the information. We also included a Google Chrome API, Google Chrome storage, and extensive other Chrome-based applications in order to make a seamless experience for users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found difficulty running Angular and NodeJS together. Early on, we had difficulties with project dependencies causing conflicts. We also ran into some issues with the different set of layers on the Google Chrome Extension, often dealing with the ramifications of not having the entire library at our disposal for access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our encryption is top notch. We used an Open P2P Asymmetrical encryption with a rolling code that would change every few days per user. Our chrome extension makes it especially simple to encode and decode messages (all with the click of a button).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned extensively about the limitations and intricacies of full-stack development. We also learned about the extensive resources available to our disposal. While we weren't able to use all of the technologies we wanted to, we now know of the future technologies available to our disposal.
