                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although mental health is becoming an increasingly prevalent discussion topic in society, there still remains a heavy stigma. Often times, this makes it hard for students to seek the help of a consellor when necessary. We wanted to create a platform where individuals are able to take the first step in recovery in an accessible and convenient fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WatMind contains an anonymous messaging service targeted towards university students with poor mental health that complies components of messages, picking out key words to measure the disparity of the situation. Students are able to anonymously chat with counsellors and volunteers on WatMind to discuss any problems they are currently facing as an easy, and convenient form of counselling. The home page contains a series of positive affirmations and mental health statistics designed to inspire users to live in a healthy mindset and seek counselling if necessary. We've also included a checklist for daily goals that are designed to encourage students to live healthier lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio for our project, programming entirely in Java and XML as the markup language. Firebase was used as a complier for the instant messaging service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time our team has used Android Studio and getting accustomed to the platform was a hurdle. In addition, the strain of virtually non-stop programming for 36 hours was a foreign and taxing experience, especially combined with working in a new IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to produce a minimalist mobile application that could be displayed on a mobile device and used by other students our age.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned the importance of setting challenging,  yet realistic goals for our projects as it means that it is easier to reach our targets, and remain motivated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WatMind
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to finish setting up the user registration process for WatMind and to implement it as a campus-wide initiate as a step forward in de-stigmatizing mental health.
