                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every member of our group is interested in data analysis. Whilst looking through the possible hacks that the companies were suggesting, we happened upon the presidential election data analysis project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project analyzes data from previous presidential elections and uses it to both notice trends in previous elections and also to use it to predict future results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first scraped the data from wikipedia using a javascript program. We then analyzed the data by converting it into a csv file and running a data analysis on it in c++. We also created a visual graphic to help better visualize the data in html/javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble coming up with an idea. In addition, none of us had worked with csv files or extracted data from a website before so we had to take some time to learn that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create a fully functional intensity election map. In addition, we learned the basics of data analysis to help us with this project in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of data analysis, how to extract data from websites, and how to read and write from csv files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for General Election Trends
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to use this program to help predict future election results in the future. We noticed a general trendline in the data and hope to use that and multiple other factors to try and predict the results in the 2016 general election.
