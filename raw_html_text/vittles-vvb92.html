                    A motley crew of programmers assembled last minute at LA Hacks 2015 and combined their various skills to create a hybrid product of two leading innovative products, Tinder and Yelp.  Vittles is a bridge that connects friends and simplifies one of life's most annoying decisions - choosing where to eat.  Nearby restaurants are randomly chosen for you.  Like it?  Swipe right!   Your choices are then sent to your friends, who then swipe left or right.  The restaurant that received the most right swipes is where you meet to eat!  Filter by geographic location, cuisine, price, and other factors to eliminate needless suggestions.  Read reviews, write reviews, and forget the fuss of arguing over what to eat!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vittles is a work in progress, but soon to be an invaluable part of your daily routine!
