                        the geo location api was used to load the map at the user's current location if the user gave us access, otherwise, the map loaded near UC Irvine (that's our school!); the places api was used to find the latitude and longitude of a location the user entered and place a marker at that spot with the appropriate description on the map

                <p>
                    Our team came to AthenaHacks to challenge ourselves and learn, and that definitely happened! There were many firsts over this weekend for our team.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            For 3/4 of us, it was our first times working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                        </strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We're all freshman with basic knowledge but ready to learn!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At first, being beginners in web dev, we had one large HTML file with all our CSS and JS embedded, making it really hard to debug and quickly identify what each part of the code was doing. Our teammate, who joined us later, explained we could actually separate the three for cleaner code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Getting our page to display how we wanted was actually pretty tough: centering, sizing, spacing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All of our first times working with the Google Maps Platforms APIs
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We spent
                        <em>
                            many
                        </em>
                        hours figuring out how to display markers on the map on the location the user specified.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How do we get input from the user for location and the incident report?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How do we get the longitude and latitude that Markers require to display once we get the location?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How are we supposed to deploy???
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Overall, we all polished our frontend skills and experience with interacting with APIs.

                    Bugs &amp; Improvements
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to deploy our website to a custom domain, however aligning the map to the user's current location sometimes does not work at 'solsafe.net' domain. Additionally, the site may need to be refreshed once before the map appears. We aren't sure what causes the problems. Regardless, we still had fun and learned while hacking this site!
