                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We and our fellow students in schools everywhere have a tendency to procrastinate. This is a big issue because it delays us from finishing our work faster, gives us bad grades, and possibly allows us to have less sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program allows students the time they want to spend working and time they want to spend resting so that they may determine a structured schedule for them to adhere to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used JGrasp, which is something that we are relatively new to learning. We created a timer that counts down our stopwatch which is made using modulus. We also created buttons to add 5, 10, or 15 minutes to the work or rest time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we wanted to use Android Studio to create this, but found it was easier for us to code in JGrasp. Another challenge we encountered was that we had trouble getting the countdown to work because it was hard to use modulus to create our goal.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud that we got our stopwatch to work successfully with no issues in the counting. We are also proud that we managed to create an idea that we hope can be useful and easy to use with our peers and other people who might have need of this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to debug more successfully. Finding the errors in our modulus made great practice for further debugging. We also learned that sometimes going with a simple idea might be the best idea. We had spent a lot of time thinking of ideas that we might do and ended up with a simple, yet effective, idea. Lastly, we learned how important it is to plan out how we were going to approach this. We had started this code head-on and it was very ineffective as we kept asking "What's next?".

                <h2>
                    What's next for Procrastination Prevention Program
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to further better this program by letting people plan ahead. We might end up with then inputting all the minutes they think they will need before hand, for their subjects they plan to accomplish. It will be like our procrastination timer app and a reminder app combined together. To take it another step, we might combine it with a calendar-like app so people can track their progress and see how well they keep on their schedule.
