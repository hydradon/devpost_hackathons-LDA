                </h2>
                <p>
                    To meet HIPAA requirements, it's important to reset your passwords every 30 days. Violations are expensive, so it's great to have a safety net in place. We're going to use OKTA for both our physician logins and patient identity management.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Either with admin login, or as a CRON job, it does a "PASSWORD EXPIRE" on all users over 30 days.

                        In the next hour we should have the SEND AN SMS to the user function completed (we had a Twilio snafu).

                    <li>
                        We're also adding parameters for managing groups and doing selective age reset (e.g., passwords &gt; 10 days old)

                <p>
                    We've used Twilio a lot in the past, and it's an elegant API. This was our first use of OKTA, and once we cleared up our understanding of SESSIONS TOKENS vs. API TOKENS, it was effortless. We were halfway through a home grown ID management solution and are scrapping it because of the ease of OKTA&gt;
