                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that there was a lack of data available to the general consumer that they could easily understand. When we saw the opportunity to solve this problem through the products offered by the sponsors at PennApps such as Goldman Sachs Marquee and Twilio APIs, we jumped on the opportunity.

                    Fin has the goal of giving financial data and advice in the most intuitive way possible, through the use of a simple chatbot interface, and the option to view data in AR. By communicating with Fin, you can perform the following tasks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Buy/sell stocks
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        View price history of stock in AR
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Get stock recommendations
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find similar stocks and view them in an AR constellation
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is divided into two main sections, the UI and the backend. The UI is built using react-native, and uses ReactViro as an AR library. All commands are passed through edas chats with our bot, which is run through Twilio Programmable Chat, which connects to a Twilio Autopilot. This Twilio autopilot then calls various endpoints on the backend so that it can retrieve data and reply to the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The backend is built on a server-less architecture using AWS Lambda. This retrieves the data and performs calculations to answer user questions. We use IEX for retrieving stock prices, Alpaca for paper trading, Marquee for portfolio analysis and stock recommendation. Finally, we can find similar stocks by using the BERT deep learning technique on descriptions of each company in the S&amp;P500.
