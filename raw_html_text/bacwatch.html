                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to a national survey almost 60 percent of college students ages 18-22 drank alcohol in the past month, and almost 2 out of 3 of them engaged in binge drinking in the past month. Drinking affects college students, their families, and college communities at large.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows its users to keep track of their Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) based of their height, weight, gender and alcohol intake. The BAC is calculated using Widmark's Formulation, which should provide a more accurate reading.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We built it using Android Studio, and java.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using Android Studio, so it took a considerable amount of time of working out the specifics of the program. There were also small certain details that we struggled to develop in the course of develop the entire app.

                <p>
                    Managed to build a somewhat function app, that accurately calculates BAC.
