                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's say you're sitting in a restaurant or you're shopping in a store but the music they're playing isn't very good. What if there's a way to be able to request the music being played in any public establishment?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project uses a Discord channel and bot that connects to Spotify to add suggested music to a queue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Discord channel and bot. Using Python3, the Bot, "JukeBot," would be able to get the suggested song and artist from any user on the Discord channel, and add it to a Spotify queue. We also added a hardware component that allows the user to press a button that prints the last suggested song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with the hardware elements because we wanted much more functionality but was not able to add it because the version of spotipy was outdated. However, we were still able to add some hardware functionality, but it was not to the extent that we wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recognize that programming with APIs can be difficult and can be even more difficult with multiple APIs, so we are proud that we were able to get the connection between multiple applications to work.

                    What's next for JukeBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add the hardware functionality that we mentioned earlier; specifically, we want a button for play, pause, and skip.
