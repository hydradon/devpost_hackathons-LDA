                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind my app was getting late due to the traffic one day but then the other day I was super early. I like to stay in bed till it's absolutely necessary for me to get ready but I don't like checking google maps every few minutes. So I needed something to notify me when I should start getting ready.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in your origin and destination, time you take to get ready,  what time you have to reach and it calculates and notifies you at the time you should start getting ready in order to reach on time by using the time it takes to reach my destination in traffic.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into the following challenges: 
** Push Notifications ** : Apple terminates apps that are in the background after a certain period of time and in order to wake up my app to start fetching the traffic data, I needed silent push notifications. However, no backend servers allow you to schedule push notifications.
** Dates ** : Dates in Swift are complicated as they print in the current timezone and store them in GMT. The conversion of GMT to current time zone was an hour off due to daylight savings time.
** Alarm ** : Apple does not allow you to develop an alarm, or let anything ring outside of your app for more than 30 seconds.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to learn as I made the app, and I have succeeded as I know many aspects of swift now such as API calls, Dates, closures, auto layout etc.

                    Make my own server to use it to send push notifications to the app in order to wake it up and make it a full fledged alarm clock with snooze functionality.
