                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were sick of wasting time trying to figure out what to wear everyday, so we wrote a fix!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can access WhateverWeather on the webapp, or using a google home mini to get the weather for your location and determines what you should wear
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an express node js server to host our RESTFUL API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asynchronous calls are very annoying. Also it was hard to determine an algorithm for picking the perfect clothes for specific weather conditions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our restful API can be used by anyone with a few GET requests. As well, our UI's simple design allows users from all walks of life to use our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WhateverWeather
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to allow users to enter their entire wardrobe to get specific clothing choices.
