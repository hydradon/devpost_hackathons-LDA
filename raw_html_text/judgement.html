                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do a superhero game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two executable files. "TextAdventure" is just gameplay testing. "Judgement" is where we're putting in the story and full game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I worked on the submitted code, Chris worked on art, Anna worked on GUI/Character Creation, and Ari worked on story.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to work under time constraints and had to create something that was unlike anything I've ever coded before
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to get a working combat system, even if it doesn't have all the extras we originally wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One night, even all night, is not enough to make even a small game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Judgement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finish it. Fix character creation, make all the powers work, and expand the story. 
First link is the manual, second is the planning sheet
