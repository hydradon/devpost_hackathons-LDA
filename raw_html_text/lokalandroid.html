                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked backwards from the user interface  by developing all our separate events in Android studios, The Functionality uses simple user registration to create the user a an account, stored on Firebase. From their lat and lon given by googles API  a radius of 6km is mathematically generated around them returning all events within the circumference of the circle. users also have the ability to filter events to there liking or create their own.

                <p>
                    The majority of our group was new to
                    <strong>
                        Firebase
                    </strong>
                    which originally slowed our progress until we learned the ropes.

                <p>
                    We very proud with the possibility of our apps practical use, it has a lot of potential. We came up with to many features for just 36 hours, we hope to on our own time add to our app features such as

                        Uber

                        Firebase
                    </strong>
                    as well as using real-time processes for the first time. We enhanced our understanding of the Java language, connecting APIs, and working in with the
                    <strong>
                        Android SDK
