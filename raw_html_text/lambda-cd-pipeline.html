                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have experienced many issues with the Cloudbees Jenkins Ecosystem and XLDeploy within FINRA in regard to performance, limiting the number builds and deployments can made within a day.
Also, there are many overheads in maintaining and upgrading these softwares as well as infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AWS Lambda Service just came out recently and appears to be a better solution to build a CD pipeline that scale automatically as it needs to, thus enable more builds and deployments to happens in parallel and at cheaper cost
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lambda CD Pipeline is a CD/CI pipeline that is highly scalable and configurable.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole system is made up of a number of small Lambda functions and ECS tasks with only 1 specific responsibility (checkout, compile, test, deploy, etc...) that get triggered in a user-defined configuration (which specifies the sequencesv of the steps get executed in the pipeline).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS Lambda run time environment is quite limited so we needed to make a good number tweaks to make one function works
                </p>
                <p>
                    Setting up AWS environment also took a large amount of time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will keep implementing more Lambda function to make a complete CD pipeline
