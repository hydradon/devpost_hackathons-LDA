                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After school, my friends and I would always play basketball at the court right next to our school. However, we would always be forced to go home with dry mouths, as the water fountain at the court would never work. So when we attended this hackathon, we decided that we wanted to make an app and website that would help everyone, not just students, to find water, and also a free public bathroom to go to after drinking the water. When we came to the hackathon today, we saw about 30 cases of PLASTIC water bottles at a hackathon with a theme of protecting and sustaining the environment. Plastic water bottle waste could be eliminated if people were able to find water fountains that work. As a result, we decided to make the app Where's my water? to help people find water fountains and public bathrooms.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After detecting the location of the user, our program accesses our database of public water fountains and bathrooms. It then overlays the locations of the water fountains and bathrooms on the google sheets, along with the reviews from our users through crowdsourcing.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our projects in 3 parts, the web-app, the andriod app, and the movie. We built the web app using google app server. Using jinja templating and an app.yaml file we were able to build

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a challenge to build the backend data structure using google datastore. We ran into challenges with github version control where we lost some of our data because of accidental overwrites.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of our teammate laura who despite being a first-time hackathon participant, was very productive and an important part of the team. I'm proud of our whole team because we finished a project that from the start I felt was impossible. For me, I was incorporating the backend database to the google maps API.

                    I learned how to plot multiple points on the google maps API using data from out datastore.
