                    We wanted to come up with a school that would get kids active and out of their seats. Children go to school for 8 hours a day and out of those 8 hours they stay seated for more then half of that time. In our school we included many forms of exercise that could be done while being taught in the classroom. Our school also has a lot of green areas to help get the children's mind active as well and to help them clam down and distress. In designing our school we took in account how it would be built the different health aspects it would include and how it would all be paid for. Our school includes things like desks with built in bike petals, standing desks and more technology in health and sponsorship with big companies. Some challenges we had were trying to design the school were the little details that would put the whole idea of the school together. We over came these challenges however by working out all the bigger details and then working around those until we eventually got closer and closer until we solved our problems. We are proud of how our website came together we worked hard on it and in the end it payed off. We learned many things about how unhealthy it is for children to be seated so long and about how it can block their creativity flow. Whats next for GitFit Academy is to be able to find suitable candidates  for our open teaching positions. But until then our website is up and ready for the public's viewing.
