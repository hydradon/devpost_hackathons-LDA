                <p>
                    Understanding stocks and identifying patterns is difficult. Even if one is technically savvy, looking at the highly verbose tickers everyday for hours can result in fatigue. Our solution is to create a voice-enabled assistant using Amazon Alexa, that can answer not only general trends/patterns and comparisons but can also answer queries related to prediction using well defined technical indicators (sma, ema, macd, rsi, stochastic etc.)
                </p>
