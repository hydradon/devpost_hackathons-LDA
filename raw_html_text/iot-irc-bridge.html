                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want it to be easier to move things into the Internet of Things, as that's the next step in automated convenience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this, I hope to make it easier for any hobbyist to connect the devices around their house to a botnet. Hopefully, one controlled by them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This takes commands from trusted users in IRC, and writes to GPIO pins based on the commands, and can report status of input GPIO pins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Black magic, ritual sacrifice, and magic smoke. (Also the Sopel Python IRC bot)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not come prepared for this project, it was actually my third project idea of this hackathon. Scraping together the electronics/wiring for this was the hardest part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, I broke my operating system when I was trying to install the kinect drivers, and operated on a kali live boot for most of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for IoT IRC Bridge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to continue development, and integrate it into a upcoming project of mine, a raspberry pi controlled vending machine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How To Try
                </h2>
                <p>
                    irc://irc.sorcery.net:6667/#Demo_IoT_IRC_Bridge
                </p>
                <p>
                    Commands are
                    <code>
                        .blink
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will not exist past the end of the hackathon, in this form at least.
                </p>
