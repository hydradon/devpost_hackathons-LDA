                    Going out and being connected with your environment around you is really important, so we wanted to create a solution reminiscent to the social Pokemon Go phenomenon where people were going out and connecting with strangers over a platform. The older adults could share this experience with family members, children, neighbors, or even do it on their own. The platform is meant for all ages so older adults can participate without feeling like its an ageist experience. Once you visit a location, you can leave physical memories there and also take other things that other people have left so the users feel like they&rsquo;re sharing their stories and lives with other people.  Something else we also ideated was a photo sharing network where after you visit a location you can take a picture there and view other peoples visits too. The ability to connect physically AND digitally might give a more flexible and diverse capability for all the users of different age groups.
