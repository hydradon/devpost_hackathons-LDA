                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to create this after seeing my grandmother go through the consequence of not taking her pills. This led  to critical circumstances and I didn't want this to happen to anyone else. This is why I wanted to create the easiest way to remember to take your pills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you open up the app, it shows you an analog clock which originally has no medications on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then you click the + button and it takes you to a choice of whether you want to take a photo of your pill label or dictate it. If you take a photo, you just take a photo and nothing more. If you dictate, you just read the name and the instructions for taking the pill, then you are done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then this adds small circles on the clock that represent when you need to take the pill. Each pill has a different color and this makes it very easy to know when to take the pills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also sends you a notification when you need to take the pills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the Google Cloud Vision API for the OCR(Optical Character Recognition). Then to parse the data, I use the natural language classifier to understand what the doctor is saying in their message on the label. I use the IBM Watson Speech to Text API to determine what the user says when they dictate the message. Lastly, I use the IBM Watson Text to Speech API to dictate back what the program reads, so that people who are visually impaired can listen to the instructions.

                    I am most proud of the fact that this was my very first app in Swift! This was also the first time that I used IBM Watson and I really liked it, so I think I am going to continue to use it. Lastly, this was my first time using the Google Cloud Vision API, and even though it was hard and took a lot of time, it works out really well and I am really proud of it.
