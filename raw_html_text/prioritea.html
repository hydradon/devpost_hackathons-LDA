                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Student life is hard and keeping track of what to prioritize can waste time better spent on actual studying. With Prioritea, a student's year weighted average, individual course grades and an overview of which grades are the lowest can all be accessed at the click of a button. An overview of what needs to be prioritized the most is Priortea's primary function.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Priortea is a 3rd party website that takes weightings of courses, assignments and quizzes and places them onto one platform for easy access to students and professors alike. Priortea does this by gathering syllabus data from selected courses within a post-secondary institution's online academic platform (ie. Western OWL).

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML and CSS were used to design the website interface. The accompanying calculations were coded with java.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first time hackers, we came in with very limited knowledge of Java and no experience with web design. Because of this, we ran into many challenges when designing the website, specifically with interactive components such as the buttons linking the different components of the website.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first-year engineers, we only have one semester of knowledge in Java programming, and very limited artistic abilities. Sealed with shouts of joy, we were able to develop an interactive 3rd party website using our new skills in HTML that solves a problem we face on a daily basis. We take pride in our work as our project can be used in real life and not just submitted for marks as school assignments are frequently founded upon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned from scratch how to code in HTML and use templates to aid in creating an effective webpage. We also developed an understanding of how to manage our time and to divide up the tasks that need to be completed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Prioritea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to finish the web design and further incorporate the Java within the website to allow for a more personalized experience.
