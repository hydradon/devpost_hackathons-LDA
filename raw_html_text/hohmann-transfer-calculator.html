                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the new generation of the space race to make this! Katelyn is an Astrophysics major and Thomas is an Aerospace engineer. This is both of our first hackathons, and we wanted to make something related to our majors and interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program utilizes a GUI, that lets the user pick which planet they wish to travel to. The program then calculates some necessary information for mission design. The program has data for all 7 other planets (not Earth) in the Solar System.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and several different libraries, outlined in the tags.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to include a GIF on the homepage, but the tkinter library had trouble processing this task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon and we are proud to have made a program that works and is of interest to us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pretty much everything we did here was new to us. We are not expert programmers!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hohmann Transfer Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For future developments, we would like to go deeper into the calculations, like using a patched conic approach in addition to the Hohmann Transfer; we would also like to consider implementing advanced maneuvers like a gravity turn. Additionally, we would like to get GIFs/animations to work, and we could definitely see this program being published on the web!
