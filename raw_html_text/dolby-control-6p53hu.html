                    Dolby Jaw introduces a new way for people to listen to music. You can pause a song by clenching your jaw, and start playing it again by clenching your jaw again. Our desktop app uses Muse, a headband which detects brain signals, to detect when a person clenches his or her jaw. The Muse is connected over Bluetooth to a computer, which is receiving data from the Muse on an OSC server. On the computer, a Java program is running, which plays a Dolby-encoded song and pauses/plays it when your jaw is clenched. Encoding our songs with Dolby helped us a lot, because it equalized the song's bass with the treble, reduced the volume to an optimal amount, and made the listener fully immersed in the song.

                    Dolby Jaw makes it more convenient for a person to control their music. Dolby Jaw helps change the way you interact between you and your music. For a long time, the way we play or pause music has been the same - by pressing a button. But what if you could play or pause music in a more intuitive, a more personal, way? This is what Dolby Jaw allows us to accomplish. Dolby Jaw is just the beginning, we believe. In the future, technology like the Muse will better interface with great sound like Dolby, so you will be able to control your music as intuitively as possible.

                    Note: Our program has no graphical user interface (GUI). If we had more time, we would surely build a GUI, but getting the Muse to detect jaw clenches and send this information to the computer was a big challenge in itself. Instead, we use a log of whether jaw clenches were detected. Based on that, music is played or paused.
