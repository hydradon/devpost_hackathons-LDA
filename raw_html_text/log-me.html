                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As university students, many of us battle with stress, anxiety, depression and even suicidal thoughts. It can be difficult to find an outlet that is both anonymous and relieving, especially as first year students battling a whole new environment and city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Log(me) focuses on two features. The first one is a Smart Journal. The Smart Journal allows users to input daily moods and logs on their days, to help them keep track of their feelings and act as a listener to their thoughts. Using Sentiment Analysis and Microsoft Azure, Log(me) is able to parse through the data to provide suggestions and meaningful data back to the user. One of these suggestions include the second feature of Log(me): a chat feature. Log(me) aims to provide easily accessible communication to a certified therapist, suicide-hotline worker, or trained student volunteers. Combined with
                    <strong>
                        data

                    and
                    <strong>
                        action
                    </strong>
                    - Log(me) aims to help improve mental health conditions.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using React, Firebase, Microsoft Azure, Material UI, and styled components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our main challenges was synching up the various parts of the app that we had each worked on. Once we tried to synch them up, we realized that there was a lot more work needed for each part, and for each part to communicate with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of the design of the webpage, and some of the animations that were built from scratch by our own teammate, Susan!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely learned the importance of communicating throughout between the different teams, and to check in about dependencies. (We also learned lots of cool software!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Log(me)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand the scope of our analytics, so that we can provide more and better mood tracking.
