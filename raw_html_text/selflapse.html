                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by selfie time-lapse videos of people that are very popular through social networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I liked that idea and thought
                    <em>
                        why I wasn't doing that?
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason was that I was just too lazy to pose everyday in front of Camera and take a picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I thought that machine could do that
                    <em>
                        lazy stuff
                    </em>
                    for me... :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If waits for screen unlock than pops up in a very little round window(
                    <em>
                        like facebook popup
                    </em>
                    ) to notify user that it's gonna take a selfie. 
So user gets ready while can see it's entire screen and isn't disturbed
                    <strong>
                        at all!
                    </strong>
                    He/She can dismiss a capture or take a selfie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If picture was bad it's deleted
                    <strong>
                        automatically
                    </strong>
                    !
                </p>
                <p>
                    User can see it's selfie gallery and order pictures by
                    <strong>
                        emotion!
                    </strong>
                    Than it's just one click to create timeLapse video from there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android SDK because only Android enables us to Popup and make smart selfie suggestion for user. 
For image filtering and emotion
                    <em>
                        Microsoft Emotion API
                    </em>
                    Than we have several services to manage picture capture, synchronisation with emotion api provider server and than deleting bad images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very difficult to make smart popup because It's not standard UI thing. 
You have to manage UI from background service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also there was difficulties with shape and design of camera preview in nonstandard popup window.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rest was as expected, scaling down images at
                    <em>
                        gridView
                    </em>
                    , reading asynchronously from disk and than placing data in recycler view (That might be changed).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also we had interesting discuss about application logo :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we finished all the work on time and application is
                    <strong>
                        fully functional!
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application Idea itself is new and innovative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that even in 36 hours you can create serious working application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team skills grew up(even if we where two :D)
                </p>
                <p>
                    We managed to design UI and also make working back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SelfLapse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think next thing will be to make this application ready for production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To add settings for making timeLapse and for choosing right time for selfie. :)
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may use better API for filtering bad quality images.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Popup window will have much better UI (Even now is good)
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will need to rewrite some code and make it more scalable for production.
