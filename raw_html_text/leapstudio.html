                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chirag is an up and coming rapper and he wanted to make fresh beats for his upcoming mixtape, but found it very hard to utilize a digital keyboard online with just his mouse for interaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application allows the user to use their hand gestures to play a digital piano and soundboard
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded in java utilizing the leap developer sdk for the motion tracking and we used Unity to set up the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    He ran into trouble when we tried to create the clicking motion of the mouse and mapping that to the downward press of the index finger. Also we had issues when we had to make the jar file for the Leap Motion run in the background.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of getting up and running with coding the leap motion with limited resources and creating a dynamic and aesthetic environment in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize unity for creating a digital environment and we learned how to code for the leap motion using java and mapping hand gestures to the mouse cursor.

                    What's next for leapStudio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding the ability to use more than just one finger at a time and improved tapping motion.
