                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting from point a to point b can be tricky, so I wanted to make it less tricky.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply put, you enter where you are and put in where you want to be and the website takes care of the rest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent most of my time working on the backend using the google maps geocoding API and some fun unexpected math! The website was thrown together quickly using flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zero web development experience, minimal coding experience, no experience using google maps APIs, it was a lot of work for one person
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made something that works, mostly!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend is easier than I expected and frontend is harder than I expected.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Website improvements, better error checking &amp; input validation, autocomplete, recognition by building codes, &amp; more! Stay tuned
