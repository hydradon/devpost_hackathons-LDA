                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Diabetes and its complications cost the NHS 10% of the annual budget -- &pound;25,000 per minute. We believe active intervention and self-management can slow this down before they experience symptoms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an app that takes patient input data to calculate the users' risk of complications and use VR to create an immersive environment to visualise the progression of complications/symptoms for better understanding than what doctor can deliver verbally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the general flow of the app using Indigo Studio and created the VR image for the progression visualisation using Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have used Unity before, therefore it took us quite a while to get familiar with the engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a 3D environment that mimics the progressive change of the diabetic eye disease.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to create 3D objects from scratch using Unity, and are more familiar with Indigo Studio.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Make more visualisations for different consequences of Diabetes, for instance, amputation of legs.
