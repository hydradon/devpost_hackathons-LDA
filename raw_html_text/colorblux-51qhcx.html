                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this idea is our family members' daily struggle with color-blindness.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides an Upload Photo or Project button for users to upload their photos or works to the web app. Then when they click "Check", users will be able to see how the photos or projects would look like under various color layers, which stimulates what color-blind people see.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django to build our web app from scratch, with the help of CBviz script (

                        https://github.com/wflynny/cbviz
                    </a>
                    ).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's absolutely our first time to use Django, so we encountered a lot of problems during the process of setting up and building the web app from scratch. Also, our first UI draft was too complicated and if it weren't for the UI/UX mentor, we probably would have never gotten even the most basic functionality done.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well we started from having absolute zero knowledge in Django to having a quite decent project in the end!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Django to build a web app, how to make appropriate UI mock up based on time restraints and user requirements.

                    What's next for ColorBlUX
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to add even more features to the ColorBlUX workspace, such as editing photos/projects, zooming, sharing, etc.
