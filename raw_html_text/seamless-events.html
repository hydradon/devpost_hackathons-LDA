                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our desire to get more involved in our community, but we're often forgetful of events we plan to attend. We wanted to help people like us who can't keep track of their events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to quickly and seamlessly connect with events in your community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a Python Flask server to communicate with Microsoft Azure to detect key info in images and an iOS app to collect the images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having only learned swift at this hackathon it was a challenge to integrate everything together. Additionally, we found that the Azure text analysis algorithms didn't fit our needs quite the way we wanted to, so we tried to work around it to accomplish our goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a working prototype by the end of our 24 hours is something we are extremely proud
                </p>
