                    Safe Complaints is a Chrome extension that replaces rape metaphors and sexist language in complaints about academics with safer language. We have also created a corresponding Twitter Bot that takes tweets with similarly problematic language and tweets back a suggested alternative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Saying "I got raped by that test" or "That essay raped me" trivializes rape and contributes to an academic environment that is unfriendly to women. Similarly, saying "That class fucked me" or "I was fucked by that quiz" perpetuates inequality in sex and degrades women and gay men.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Chrome extension replaces the words "raped" and "fucked" in the context of complaining about academics with "wrecked," a less problematic word, instead. The Twitter Bot does the same, but with "rekt" rather than "wrecked."
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope to bring greater awareness to the ways in which our everyday language can reflect sexism and foster a noninclusive environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Disclaimer: does not necessarily replace all improper uses of "raped" and "fucked" in the context of complaining about academics and may incorrectly replace other uses of the words "raped" and "fucked" when those words are near words relating to academics.
