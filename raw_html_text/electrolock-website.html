                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personally, we have witnessed many of our friends lose their bicycles in school and public areas. As per our research, we have learned that the number of bicycle thefts in the U.S. is growing and no one has stepped up to solve this underrated issue. We are determined to solve bicycle theft with our unique solution
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Electrolock uses a motor to run a clamp/brake device that will stop the front wheel from any motion.This lock will be activated by a mobile app or an RFID tag.This app/RFID tag will also be used to deactivate Lock. This Lock will prevent bike thefts in public areas despite the existence of inoperative
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on creating a inconspicuous bike frame for the front wheel which would hide our digital bike lock. Our arduino circuit board would be attached underneath the bike frame and the clamp would be controlled by two servos which would secure the front wheel.The arduino would be controlled by a mobile android app using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Tags. We would use buttons provided by the Arudiuno Kit to create 4-digit manual override code, which would be placed underneath the bike frame, in case the user's device runs out of battery.(Refer to the Design tab to see a more in-depth presentation of the product). We are using 1 brush-less motor along with two gears to runt the clamp/brakes.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A potential challenge that we may face is connecting the hardware such as an arduino, which is on the bike wheel, to an app on your phone.In addition, creating a clamp that could be efficiently monitored by the arduino, while preventing the front wheel from moving could pose as a challenge. Finally, coming up with an idea for a productive alarm system that alerts the bike owner was very difficult
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our progress and improvement in our design and the maturity of our idea. We have created a fully functional website that provides great statistics and information about a very practical solution. We have made the connection between the arduino and the user much quicker as the project has progressed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We researched for hours on bicycle theft data and we learned many new and interesting facts. Also, we learned about RFID and this completely eliminated the need for Bluetooth. We went more in-depth on arduino and refined our knowledge .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ElectroLock Website
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have also created an app for the ElectroLock, and we want to combine it with the website (link them together). We have also created an arduino diagram on how to build it and program, but unfortunately there was no hardware provided for us to work with.
