                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us are part of the first ever Archery team at Highlands High School, and the scoring system for archery tournaments is inefficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates a digital, more efficient way of tabulating individual scores of participants in archery competitions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first established what we wanted to do, then we had to figure out how we were going to retrieve the answers. Then we split up and used google and stack overflow to figure it out. We got a working project before we went to bed, then in the morning we ran through and improved it the best we could.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After about 8 hours, we had to really simplify, basically redo our program, because we were getting too deep into something that we couldn't figure out. It was also hard to keep everyone target.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to manipulate jframe better, and the fact that we actually got it to work. Creating a buffered image and getting the color values from under your mouse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JFrame, BufferedImage, getRGB, listeners, how to combine our separate projects, how to come up with a plan in the beginning.
                </p>

                    What's next for ARK (Archery Record Keeper)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the program into a mobile app for convenience, as well as reformatting the UI. We would also make a profile system that would allow users to log into an account that would keep track of their overall statistics between tournaments. Another thing we would add is a way for the app to automatically submit your results to the administrator of the competition, greatly decreasing the time it would take to get back your overall placement.
