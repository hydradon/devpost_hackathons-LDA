                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The online dating market is worth an estimated 1.2 billion dollars
                    <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/372/100/online-dating/worldwide" rel="nofollow">
                        link
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this in mind I wanted to create an app that could tap into this market by offering users a new perspective and approach to dating. The mobile app would enable this by simply matching users based on their positive personality traits, which I got via the
                    <code>
                        GenomeLink API
                    </code>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    This in turn, would lead to higher rates of dating satisfaction by the users because generally speaking humans tend to relate better with people, who have similar personality traits as them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally another part of my inspiration is that the more people are satisfied with the matches they get from the app, the more likely they are to spread the word about the app,  hence making it a win-win situation for everyone :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app basically allows users to swipe, match and chat each other, through its 2 main parts, which are
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The mobile app, which is what the users will login into our system with
                            <em>
                                via facebook
                            </em>
                            .
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                After they login, users then have to link their genome link account via OAUTH.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Then after linking their genome link accounts, the app then sends the users personality report to the backend which in turn does some computation and returns other users in the system that match the user's personality.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                From there is just a matter of swiping, matching and chatting till the user gets a suitable connection :)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The other part is the backend, which aggregates the positive traits in a user's personality report.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                It then returns to the mobile app, profiles that match the user's personality, from there the user can begin swiping and matching.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To fully understand how the app works, kindly watch the video, it shows how the app works screen by screen and the expected outputs. Also don't forget to install it from the playstore and test it out, thanks .

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the app using
                    <code>
                        react-native
                    </code>
                    for the frontend and
                    <code>
                        node.js
                    </code>
                    for the backend. The app also uses
                    <code>
                        firebase
                    </code>
                    as the database  to store data for both the app and the
                    <code>
                        node.js
                    </code>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    I ran into 2 main challenges when developing this app, which are
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Lack of testing with live users.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Since the
                                <code>
                                    GenomeLink API
                                </code>
                                only supports American users for now, it was impossible for me to test the app with live users since i'm from Kenya, but the test users provided in the docs proved sufficient and I was able to generate test data which I then used in testing the app.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Lack of mobile OAUTH support for the
                            <code>
                                GenomeLink API

                                It would be nice in the future to support OAUTH for mobile devices instead of support for the browser only, though I managed to bypass this by initiating the OAUTH process in a mobile browser and then passing the results back to the app via
                                <code>
                                    deeplinking

                <p>
                    I learned that the
                    <code>
                        Genome Link API
                    </code>
                    is a very powerful tool, especially for a dating app, since it allows for new capabilities  that other competitors in the market are currently not providing hence the possibility of growth is high.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the tech side, I also learned how to
                    <code>
                        deeplink
                    </code>
                    a mobile app from a website which is something I had never done before.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I also want to expand the matching capabilities to support more
                    <code>
                        GenomeLink API
                    </code>
                    reports and include features like matching via location, auto-swiping, group swiping and finally also add more login options i.e. Google Login e.t.c
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally I also want to introduce some in-app purchases, once the app gains traction, so that it can sustain it's development and also so that I can also be able to bring in more people to help with the development, marketing and distribution of the app.
