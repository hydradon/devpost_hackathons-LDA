                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I am in the process of teaching currencies of various countries to my daughter, I was looking for an efficient way for her to learn. Alexa skills is one of the places I was looking for, but I couldn't find any thing that can solve my purpose. I was looking for something which can teach and also quiz you on your knowledge. That gave me an inspiration to build one for myself.
                </p>

                        Guide Intent  - which tells currencies of various countries across the world.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I create Lambda function using nodejs for my skill. And used APL framework to display images and text on display enabled devices.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Documentation is pretty good and with the help of available examples, I am able to build this skill with out much difficulty. Debugging lambda nodejs function is one thing i couldn't figure out. Faced some issues in debugging errors.

                <p>
                    Usage of APL is something which I am really proud of. Not many examples are not there. So, I am able to figure out myself and finished successfully.

                        Currently images used in APL are static. Would like to change them based on the country thats being asked in quiz.

                        Would like to divide quiz into multiple levels. As user clears one level, he/she will advance to next level.
