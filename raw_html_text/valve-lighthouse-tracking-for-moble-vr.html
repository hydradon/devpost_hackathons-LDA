                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With virtual reality becoming mainstream the only real viable options are to buy a expensive computer and have a tethered experience. You could also buy a smartphone and have a watered down mobile experience. Valves' lighthouse technology allows for efficient calculation of position and is perfect for mobile VR. Other tracking solutions exist, but required massive amounts of image processing. This advanced image processing drains the battery quickly.l

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a base station (lighthouse) which flashes every 8.3 milliseconds, clearing the sensors and prepping them for a sweep. The base station sweeps horizontally and then vertically. The horizontal sweep gives us our x coordinate while the vertical sweep gives us our y. Using a linear system of equations, solved with Jacobean methods, we calculate the sensors position in  as 3D space. We use the Tiva C to capture the timing for each sensor.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using google cardboard, Tiva C microcontroller, and android phone.
