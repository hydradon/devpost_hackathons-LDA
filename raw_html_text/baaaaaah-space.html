                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    baaaaaah.space was inspired by my personal experience with tracking cookies. I periodically clear my cookies but because this removes all my session cookies as well, I have to log into every website again. We wanted to create a tool that empowers users to understand the ways in which they're being tracked and help them take control of their personal data in an easier and more precise manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    baaaaaah.space allows users to remove tracking cookies while leaving session cookies. It also informs users where the cookies that exist on their browser are from and how long they've been there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    baaaaaah.space was built using javascript to extract user cookies and display them in an intuitive manner while allowing them to be managed. While other cookie managers exist, none were designed with the intent of educating the user about how their data is tracked and putting them in control of their data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially intended to create this utility as a chrome extension, however, javascript execution permissions regarding cookie extraction from all websites led us to change our design to a website instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of registering the domain baaaaaah.space which represents the transition of the user from an uninformed sheep to a knowledgable nebula.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the inner workings of chrome extensions and how browsers store cookie information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for baaaaaah.space
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step is to potentially expand into a full-featured chrome extension for user convenience.
