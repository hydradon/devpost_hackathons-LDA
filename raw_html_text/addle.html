                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You know as well as we do, innovators are often first movers. When apple released the new ad search platform for IOS, we saw big potential. As we used the campaign builder, we realized a huge flaw in the product: the Keyword Tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Addle gives developers and marketers hope.
The keyword tool built into apples new platform is awful (and probably intentionally so). We equip search ad users with the necessary tools  and data (keyword planner, search volume, relevance, etc) to make effective marketing decisions, save time and reach everyone in their target market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Addle with SendGrid, AppTweak Node(of course).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API's we were using limited our requests which made it difficult to consistently test our app during development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have solved a real problems that marketers have experienced while using the very early Apples Search Ads.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Addle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Production! We have a few kinks to work out but hope to bring it to market soon! Keep an eye out for Addle ;)
