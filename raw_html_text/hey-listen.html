                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, I had plans to make an innovative app that would help people with difficult tasks, but after struggling for a long time, I decided to make this web game instead because I gave up and just wanted to make something for myself to play at 3 am in the morning. It started off really simple, but eventually grew to be quite difficult and quite interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, this game is like Simon Says. An image will appear on the screen and give instructions about what key on the keyboard to press. Users will have 60 seconds to cycle through as many images as possible and to increase their combo, which increments after each successful turn. If the user inputs an incorrect key, then the combo will break and return to 0.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a lot of bootstrap to help format the design of my website (I really like to use bootstrap panels in case it wasn't already obvious). There is also some mild css that helps make my website look better as well. The main "meat" of the program comes from javascript, which listens for keydown events and programs actions for button presses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At every step of the process, the game seemed to be way too simple. I think the hardest part wasn't actually the programming, but coming up with ways to make the game more engaging and difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think it's pretty fun to play, and I can definitely see myself and others wasting a lot of time in the future on this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned some things from the seminars that I attended, and I also learned to work through fatigue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for "hey, listen!"
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe have some way to save high scores? I attempted this before but some reason it wouldn't work so I just enhanced the rest of the web app. If I had more time, I would definitely try to find some way for users to save their scores.
