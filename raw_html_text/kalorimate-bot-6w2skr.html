                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do you have any food allergies? Have you ever wished there was a quick and easy way to find out if you could safely consume something? If not, have you ever wondered what exactly is in your meal? These questions are ones that our team has pondered. We realized that we could help people with food allergies as well as those who want to watch what they eat.

                    <strong>
                        KaloriMate
                    </strong>
                    is a revolutionary personal nutrition assistant. It is a chatbot app that checks for allergens that food contains. It also provides users with the food's nutritional facts.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our chatbot
                    <strong>
                        KaloriMate
                    </strong>
                    on Cisco's Webex platform using Botkit and combined it with Clarifai's Image Recognition API. By utilizing Clarifai's 'Food' model and database, we are able to recognize images of food items down to the ingredient level. Integrating it with Wolfram Alpha's API, we can also get the nutrition facts from the detected food image.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    With the

                        24-hour
                    </em>
                    time constraint, it was challenging to integrate the Clarifai API and Wolphram Alpha API into the Cisco Webex platform. Our team struggled through reading the documentation while figuring out the API implementation piece by piece through trial and error.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    IT WORKS! Our team finally get our Chatbot working through Cisco Webex with Clarifai Image Recognition and Wolfram Prediction tools all working together! Thanks to some team members who worked through the whole night!
