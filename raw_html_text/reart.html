                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are five "R"s to living a sustainable life: refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, and rot. Often times, people put more emphasis on recycling than the three "R"s before it, but really before recycling there is one more option made possible by out hack: ReArt.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ReArt is an android app that serves as both a mobile market place for anyone to sell their waste and a community for the artists purchasing this waste and to share the artwork they create using this unorthodox medium. Everyday people can list their trash categorized by material and receive a small monetary reward for saving the planet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the tools in Android Studio to set up the basic front-end design of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since neither of us had any experience with Android app development, we needed to learn all the basics of Android Studio, and many times we found ourselves frustrated at the hours spent writing code that had been one of the built-in functions of Android Studio. Additionally, we ran into many formatting issues along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think we have a very sound idea that has great potential in facilitating the reuse of waste before it gets recycled. Our front end design, although not yet fully functional, is very neat, and, with some work, could lead to an app that functions and look professional, and looks inviting to users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only did we learn the basic workings of Android Studio, but we also learned how to work under pressure to solve an issue that will influence the greater good. Additionally, we learned how to program efficiently and and fix bugs that seemed complicated but turned out to be very simple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ReArt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue working on developing the app to launch ReArt. We have many ideas for the next steps in ReArt's development and working on the back-end technicality.
