                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a phone that is misplaced within a house, logging into an iCloud account from another iPhone or through the website can be a tedious process and something that could cause your currently behind schedule to fall even further behind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AI Smart Home devices are so prevalent in our lives today, so we turned to Alexa to make this bump in your day a bit smoother.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an Alexa skill and conjunctive React application that allows housemates to save their icloud username and password under their name. Later, if their phone is misplaced, a simple Alexa call should help them find it easily!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Alexa Developer Site to create the basic algorithm, including the various possible intents. The simple web-application was build with react and used a MongoDB database to store the user iCloud information. We then connected the database to the Alexa lambda function and tested out the different commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one on our team had any experience making an Alexa skill. We all needed to do a fair amount of research before we began, but struggled with a few lambda related problems along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By the end of the event, we were able to get Alexa to ping missing phones!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are much more comfortable working with Amazon's developer site. We now know the basics of creating a skill and hope to deploy it to the Alexa Skill Store in the future.
