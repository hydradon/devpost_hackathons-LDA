                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by my passion for math and investing. Geometric brownian motion can help us in understanding the future trends of a specific stock. I am passionate about investing in stocks and even crypto currencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code presents the future trends of a stock in terms of price by a graph.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built in python. I took the stochastic differential equation of GBM and plugged in values to predict its future price in 2 years.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Theres a lot of math involved in this thats a bit above my level. I had to understand how to use stochastic differential equation which i have learnt about yet. It was challenging to do normal distribution and standard deviation with having very little background of python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of how I achieved a simplified code to create GBM model to predict future stock prices for a give time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to define functions, use if statements, use plot functions, make comments, do basic arithmetic (and assign values) and import functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for gbm stocks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more knowledge about python I will able to add some options for pricing and other functions related to the Black-Sholes model of GBM. Extensions would include constructing a local volatility model (perhaps based on some historical data such as index prices you could download from somewhere) or a stochastic volatility model. This can also help me in creating a Monte-Carlo simulation using GBM. Monte carlo helps in estimating risk for stocks and portfolios.
