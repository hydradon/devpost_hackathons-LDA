                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Singapore is prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and cyclones. Where prevention is not an option, we must turn to effective preparation. This encouraged us to build a VR application which mainly aims at training the citizens in disaster management skills. The app can be used in schools, universities and even in corporations to train individuals. By training the public, we make sure they don't panic in real life emergencies and are able to make informed decisions to help themselves and others.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is a simulation for a person living in an HDB, and the user has to move through scenes making decisions from the given options. Making the right choices leads to your survival, otherwise leading to your death.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The scenes were built in Unity and various aspects of the game are triggered using C# scripts written by us.
