                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired from recent mass casualty incidents where it took days for family members or friends to find their loved ones. Especially those in the recent Manchester Ariana Grande terrorist attack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a unique QR code to each patient as they enter a hospital or even before that during triage treatment, this QR code will link to a patient ID that contains their full name, date of birth and location within our database. Relatives or friends can search for their loved ones on the database through a webpage, if the patient is located within the system, the relatives will be redirected to the patient profile which shows their location. This massively cuts down on search times as the system built in now has relatives searching each and every hospital.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html and python to create an interactive application which allows people to search for loved ones and doctors to add patients to a database and for the patient location to be updated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for In Times of Need
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would hope to apply a text messaging service to our application so that parents and relatives can have real-time updates, we would do this using Nexmo's Node Red. Hence, ease the process of finding loved ones.
