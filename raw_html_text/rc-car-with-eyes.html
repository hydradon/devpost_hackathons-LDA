                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Autonomous robot/RC car that moves on its own without crashing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It senses the surrounding via sonar sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got a normal RC car, added some sonar sensors to it on Arduino, and tried to control the movement of the car programatically
                </p>

                    I burned one of my Arduino
