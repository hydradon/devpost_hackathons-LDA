                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hillel, the Jewish Resource Center wanted a more efficient way than walking table to table to check students in at their events so that they can report to donors how many students were coming to their events, how many different students were actively participating, etc. This is important because Hillel supports hundreds of students weekly with dinner, fun/relaxing events, and a safe place. Thus, we want to help Hillel see which events are attracting more students than others so that they can continue to report numbers donors want to hear, while keeping participation to its max.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You will be prompted on the website to enter a .cvs file with col A first name and col B last name. A script will run and enter each person to the PostgreSQL database. Then, when you want to check in people at the event, you will take their ID, swipe it, and the program will add to the database that the person was admitted with a timestamp or it will reject the person if they're not in the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using python scripts, as well as Amazon Web Services for the PostgreSQL Backend. We also used a little bit of HTML and if we have time CSS to make the website look somewhat nice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to download a certain tool/how to make it work. Without these problems we would be able to include much more features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we wrote scripts to decode information on a license or a student ID card. We're also proud that we were able to connect it to the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned python scripting, how to use Amazon web services, python scripting with SQL commands.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're hoping to finish this project by the deadline, but if not we'll definitely continue developing in hopes of making this project useful.
