                    This was a difficult project for us because we had never used React-native before. We overcame adversity after losing a team member or two and worked together to develop an idea that was probably too big of a scope for the time we had. We learned a lot and if given more time would have taken this to the next level. We also have this deployed on google cloud platform.
