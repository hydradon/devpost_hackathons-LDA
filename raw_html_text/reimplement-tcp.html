                <p>
                    Wanted to learn about the challenges faced by TCP

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python implementation of TCP built on top of UDP. Uses TCP headers.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Robust against corruption, arbitrary delays, and dropped packets on the sending channel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implements RFC 6298 to calculate RTT and use that information to change the resend timeout.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wrote a naive implementation that assumed in-order, non-corrupt delivery. Then expanded it to handle dropped packets, reordered packets, and repeated packets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TCP is fairly stateful, so there were a lot of edge cases to consider. Also had to ensure malicious clients/servers couldn't cause their peers to transition into a incorrect state by sending invalid packets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I cut a lot of corners with performance --- first by using Python, and later by preferring straightforward, easy-to-verify code over performant code. Creating a production-ready TCP stack in C would be at least 50x harder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Handling an ACK channel that can arbitrarily delay and lose packets. This will involve three-way handshaking for connection setup and teardown, as well as a lot more state management.
