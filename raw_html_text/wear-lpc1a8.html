                    You code while working from home, and suddently you're hungry.
                </p>

                    What do you wear?
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this, we've developed a command line utility to know what's appropriate to wear given your local temperature
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using a Lorawan device and the microshare.io api, we are able to easily retrieve the temperature data from our device and compare that to an expected set of temperatures.
