                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got hooked on the idea of designing and playing through puzzles that inspired meaningful decisions. We also wanted to create a platform to exercise planning and critical thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Monkey Maze is a game about traversing on treetops to reach the goal - however, the trees break immediately after you leave them. Every decision is final, encouraging the player to be deliberate in their actions and consider unorthodox solutions. Much like modern logic puzzles, each level builds upon preceding mechanics to offer new and fresh challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each map is a grid-like system in which you must reach the goal by going up, down, left, or right. Eventually, as new mechanics and features are introduced, you must solve various mechanics that build upon each other like jumping to a tree with a bird granting you the ability to fly over broken trees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created models in Blender, Scripts in C# and Unity, and several hours of puzzle design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Puzzle designs that were both mentally stimulating and not repetitive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The creation of an aesthetically appealing and enjoyable gaming experience built in a mere 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about puzzle designing, 3D modeling, and animation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Monkey Maze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to polish the product and roll out updates in the in the coming week.
