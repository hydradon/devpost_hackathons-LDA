                <p>
                    In a developing country like Kenya, where agriculture is the backbone of the country, agriculture is plagued by several problems like small and fragmented land holdings, manures, pesticides, chemicals used for agriculture etc. consumers also increasingly demand for the healthy diet that is rich
in quality and free of agricultural chemicals and pesticides. Our project fills in the above said difficulties and demands using hydroponics and we  can go organic. Since it is done in the controlled environment, it can be done anywhere like
                    <strong>
                        rooftops room terrace, balcony
                    </strong>
                    etc. in cities and towns and solve the problem of hidden hunger as well as promote aesthetic beauty. Also large amount of plants can be planted in a less place. This type of agriculture could be high yielding if monitored and controlled efficiently.Our project will controls the necessary conditions required for the plant to grow hydroponically and also cultivators may control the agriculture remotely using
                    <strong>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This system can monitor the environment of hydroponic device through some sensors in a real-time and stable way,
and then accurately, automatically transmit the data of temperature, humidity, light intensity, water level and pH in
real time through

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I Built it on with NodeJs on back end and Node Red On system configuration for IoT Real time notification and Javascript on front End.The HW platform was the Arduino Mega 328. This was used as it is open source and it provides enough pins to support a 3.2&rdquo; TFT screen and numerous sensors. In addition, it provides access to pins which support interrupts making it ideal for this project. The available space for SW is 250KB, which is more than enough for this project. It supports
                    <strong>
                        EEPROM
                    </strong>
                    storage meaning that any user data was permanently stored.

                <p>
                    I had time challenge to complete prototyping and simulation of the hardware with the cloud. Also finances to fund research was a challenge.

                <p>
                    I've connected to things speak and i have installed to my neighbors and my own balcony where i fetch fresh veggies every anytime.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i learnt how to interact with things speak and how to connect Node-Red  twitter notifications with the smart hydroponics system. this enables control of your farm by retwitting.
