                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wondered what'd win - a broken Audi A4 with no brake pads that mysteriously emitted blue smoke, or a Ford Focus with a distressing tendancy to swerve left with no warning. Then we found out. It was the Audi, by the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grabs MOT data from the government. Finds common causes of MOT failure. Estimates how that would affect numerical handling data in GTA: San Andreas. Uploads to a heavily modified server. Races.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Server's handled by Lua scripting. Python scripts sift through the data. Map data was heroically done by hand because the guy who was supposed to do it fell asleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WiFi kept failing on us. Time restraints. WiFi. Server crashed depending on a number of factors, possibly including the current phase of the moon, and how much we needed it to work. WiFi.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No single member knew every language used. Teamwork makes the dream work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of Lua scripts. Python. Patience is a key virtue.
                </p>

                    What's next for GTA: Barely (road)Legal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More maps. More interesting points of failure.
                </p>
