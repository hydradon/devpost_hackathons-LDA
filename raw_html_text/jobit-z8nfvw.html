                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found out that, in the part of the world where we live, it's very hard to get employment. Even with the right requirements and qualifications, it is still very hard. We've come to realise this isn't a problem for Africa only, it's a global problem. What we are working on is, a solution to connect people with the right employers/employees. We're helping people to connect with the right opportunities, form better communities and bring the world closer together.
                </p>
