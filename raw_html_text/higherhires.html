                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interviewing is hard for almost everybody. We wanted to make the experience a little less harsh and awkward for the interviewer and the interviewee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HigherHires is an online video chat service targeted towards recruiters. We provide real time emotional and biometric data on the interviewee like level of anger, surprise, happiness or heart rate so that the recruiter can adjust their questions accordingly. Helping the candidate be at ease would help them show their true potential and the company would be able to get a better outcome from their recruiting process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript and webRCT to implement the live video chat and front end. Node and Express js were used for the backend. We used the Microsoft Cognitive Services api to do sentiment analysis and computer vision for the heart rate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a live video chat system took a huge chunk of our time and posting live data to the cognitive services api proved to be very difficult since we needed to convert images to binary data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have an end product that does what it advertises.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learn't to use webRTC and video stream api's in the browser along with the Microsoft Cognitive Service API.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be adding Eye Tracking and Respiratory Tracking to enhance our services.
