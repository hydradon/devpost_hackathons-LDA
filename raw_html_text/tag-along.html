                    Story Behind the Project
                </h4>
                <p>
                    In North America, baby boomers are currently the largest generation by population. In the US alone, there are approximately
                    <em>
                        76 million baby boomers
                    </em>
                    . Human beings are social animals that evolved to thrive in a collaborative network of people. Loss of social interaction can lead to negative side effects that are accelerated during aging. As a result, as the baby boomer generation ages, negative aging side effects will become more prevalent due to social isolation. Numerous studies indicate that this trend is a primary factory in declining health functions. It was concluded that social isolation is directly linked to
                    <em>
                        Alzheimer's, Parkinson's
                    </em>
                    , and

                    mobile application is a social engagement tool where users can create and share activities with family, friends or share to the public. Accompanying the functionality of this application, the Augmented Reality

                    Implementation
                </h4>
                <p>
                    We started the brainstorming process by using mind maps to determine what the problem is, and different branches as to who it effects, when, where, why, and how. Which then lead to the realization of the product along with careful consideration for the target audience and the accessibility requirements that need to be supported. This resulted in the creation of wireframes through Whimsical, drawing illustrations, creating the AR functionality through Unity, backend development through Google Cloud API integrated with Unity using C#, and all of this combined to create a working prototype.

                    What We Learned
                </h4>
                <p>
                    We learned to thoroughly outline the problem at hand before attempting to implement a solution in order to ensure all criteria and constraints of the problem are factored in. We also learned that time management is vital in creating a prototype for any project, this was done by breaking down the project into smaller portions and to set deadlines for each in order to track progress.

                    It is our hope to continue to develop our application by incorporating user created avatars that are personally customized, and implementing more AR activity scenes. Lastly, we hope that
