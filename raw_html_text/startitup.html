                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a single mother in my neighborhood who made handicraft gifts to make for a living. However, she was not very comfortable in going door to door and wanted to work from home which made networking and resources difficult to make apt sales. This is a problem faced by many home-based businesses as they don't have much knowledge for financial accounting and cutting-edge technology to make strategic information in order to provide services to the target audience. This is what inspired us to provide a platform to such entrepreneurs and startups so that they can work together and support to grow.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Any startup can register itself and will be provided with its own webpage in the form of a unique profile. Then they will be able to opt for various services such as hiring people, finding potential market, can be used to help them to keep their account books which later can be used to give insights into the financial and marketing status of the company etc. This will further allow it to connect with any other startup registered on the website to network together which adds to the factor of advertising and exchange of services. Also, employees looking for jobs in such startups can apply here as per the real skillset they have.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Potential market in terms of future sales was predicted using dummy dataset and machine learning by applying the linear regression algorithm. And the result was displayed using Rshiny.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a bit off track from the sub-themes but not the main theme as our idea was for Finance for India and not for Financial Technology.
