                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by a lack of clarity over text messages - which can often lead to emotional trauma - we decided to leverage an AI to help analyze the intentions behind text messages. This could prove especially useful to individuals with emotional learning disabilities such as with Autism and Aspergers'.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emotional Assistant processes a message and returns the confidence of six common emotions. We return the highest confidence and display it to the recipients of the message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a chatroom using Socket.IO and Express/NodeJs. The messages are intercepted and fed through paralleldots' emotional analyzer API. The output is brought back to the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with wit.ai - manually training the model. It was insufficient, and close to the deadline we had to swap to parallelDots emotional analysis.
We also started with a login-implemented boilerplate and decided to drop that for a simpler, sleeker UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wiring so many libraries was incredibly convoluted and the team is proud that the final output is (more or less) polished and functional as originally specified.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a chat room is a lot harder than it seems. Even with a wonderful library like Socket.IO.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emotional Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a custom LTSM AI NN with brain.js to analyze the conversational tone with respect to the emotional analysis of all chat messages in a conversation. In short, analyzing the tone of a developing conversation based on the tone of the messages.
