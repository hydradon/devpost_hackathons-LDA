                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to do this project because we need our food ASAP. Throughout the hackathon, Cody ate food many, many times and he needs to continue that at the dining halls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project records the current occupancy of the five dining halls at UGA, where we go, as well as the trends for past traffic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Bootstrap, HTML, and JS for the front-end website design; and we used Firebase for storing values into a database with the original JSON from UGA servers. We had a week and a half worth of logs to translate to the Firebase database which we used Python 3 to parse and test. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) was used to support adding to the database automatically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were properly fetching current data on Google's App Engine on GCP and appending it to the Firebase database. Being able to parse through the JSON was a hot topic thought our development cycle.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to do four of the cryptography workshop challenges and have enough time to focus our last fourteen hours on this web project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GCP is problematic at best. It is difficult to work with compared to Amazon's AWS, but we managed to figure it out, sorta.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dining Dawgs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving everything from GCP to AWS and polishing up the website to have most, if not all, of the functionality that was originally planned, such as: trends, derivatives, normalization, averages, etc. It will be fun.
