                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're tired of algorithms tailoring our web experiences to intensify tunnel vision around our interests. How do you talk to a person that is perfectly filtered out of your view? And if you can find that person, what should you do with that conversation?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A survey will pair you with a user whose profile opposes yours the most, and a conversation dialog will be opened between the two of you. The Anti-Pen Pal stream will then be available for a specific topic and question on the home page, to be vote upon by other users. The merit of the discourse is rewarded with upvotes and unproductive conversation is downvoted to the bottom of the page. Dynamic voting and messaging encourages an Anti-Pen Pal pair to improve their comments and engage actively in their discussion.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it our web application using flask on heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our backend development couldn't be correctly synced with our frontend work in time for the demo, but our work could be built upon for a functional application with a bit more time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never built a webapp from the ground up before, and I'm new to flask/python development. I'm glad I learned how to get a webapp up and running quickly, and I learned the basics of working with flask on heroku. I'll definitely be using heroku again and building with flask will help me develop my python abilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot in a short amount of time and I'm excited to improve my skills by hacking on the project further. I came in with specialized experience that I worried wouldn't be helpful to my group at all -- but I stuck it out and I was happy to find parallels between what I knew and what we were working with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Anti-Pen Pal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to clean up the backend so the app runs cleanly, it would be cool to see how a small group of people interact with the app.
