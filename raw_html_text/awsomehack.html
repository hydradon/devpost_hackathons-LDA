                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The cryptocurrency market is an industry which is expanding at an exponential rate. Everyday, thousands new investors of all kinds are getting into this volatile market. With more than 1,500 coins to choose from, it is extremely difficult to choose the wisest investment for those new investors. Our goal is to make it easier for those new investors to select the pearl amongst the sea of cryptocurrency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To directly tackle the challenge of selecting which cryptocurrency to choose, our website has a compare function which can add up to 4 different cryptos. All of the information from the chosen cryptocurrencies are pertinent and displayed in a organized way. We also have a news features for the investors to follow the trendiest news concerning their precious investments. Finally, we have an awesome bot which will answer any questions the user has about cryptocurrency. Our website is simple and elegant to provide a hassle-free user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by building a design prototype of our website using Figma. As a result, we had a good idea of our design pattern and Figma provided us some CSS code from the prototype. Our front-end is built with React.js and our back-end with node.js. We used Firebase to host our website. We fetched datas of cryptocurrency from multiple APIs from: CoinMarketCap.com, CryptoCompare.com and NewsApi.org using Axios. Our website is composed of three components: the coin comparison tool, the news feed page, and the chatbot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the hackathon, we ran into many challenges. First, since we had a huge amount of data at our disposal, we had to manipulate them very efficiently to keep a high performant and fast website. Then, there was many bugs we had to solve when integrating Cisco's widget to our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we built a web app with three fully functional features. We worked well as a team and had fun while coding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use many new api's including Cisco spark and Nuance nina. Furthermore, to always keep a backup plan when api's are not working in our favor. The distribution of the work was good, overall great team experience.
