                    By fostering creativity and learning the teamwork helped strength our communication skills that allowed the team to work on new tools that opened our eyes to different technologies.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Within the first year of launching the platform in the presence of Health institutions and NGO&rsquo;s in Ethiopia, we will be deploying the system in collaboration with the government and/or NGO&rsquo;s. Once this is complete we would be providing training for Hospitals, Clinics and Health extensions and creating awareness for the people about the platform objective and goal.
On the second year, the next and improved version will be launched. We expect to have a more reliable data than the previous year by implementing the difficulty solutions and adding other organizations data into our database to observe the difference.
On the third year, the patient's database will be ready more than ever which will be ready for sale and we would be introducing our platform throughout other African Countries to collect patient data.
