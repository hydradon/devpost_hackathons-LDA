                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration for NewsHub came from recent controversy over false news, as well as growing uncertainty amongst the public over bias in reporting. 
Additionally, we wanted to offer a way for everyday people to quickly get relevant facts through the summaries generated on NewsHub, to remove the necessity to click into articles and make news more accessible to everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NewsHub will bring up the 6 top trending events in the news with photos and summaries when loaded, and allows the user to search for news topics and receive summaries of relevant articles and analysis of bias in articles.
                </p>
