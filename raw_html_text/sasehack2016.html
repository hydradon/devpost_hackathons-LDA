                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to meet with a non-profit organization employee and she told us about some of the problems she face. One of the biggest problem she faced is not being able to find and connect with other non-profit organizations. There is not one comprehensive directory of all the non-profit organizations in the city and often someone who needs help form 1 non-profit has other needs from another non-profit that specializes in that area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This platform will serve as a comprehensive list of all non-profit organizations that operates in the United States. A donation system will also be incorporated so that users can easily donate to multiple organizations in the same platform, keep track of donations, and share with others what they have contributed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using PHP as backend, and HTML, CS and Javascript as front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not having enough time to complete what we want. The Hackathon is cut short and multiple events overlapping, making it harder to complete tasks at hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The organization home page looks BEAUTIFUL! We are really proud of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to succeed, we must forgo sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Givingly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a real need for a platform like this. Hopefully we will have time to polish and complete it.
