                    We wanted to make a site based on sharing good or happy news people enjoy. Also it would mark opinion pieces as opinion and fact-checked pieces as actual news. Unfortunately we struggled the first night with understanding how this would all work with our very limited experience on any front end development. So as it got later and later we decided to make it a bit simpler and just build a website. Clay took it home the next day and basically just built a site from scratch while several of us struggled trying to figure out a database that never worked.

                <h2>
                    It's literally just a Mizzou news site
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Clay built the website face while Brian, Mark, and I struggled unsuccessfully to create a database to hold info if submitted
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We literally knew nothing about database management and the only person with any HTML/CSS experience was Clay

                    We have barely scratched the surface for CS
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Maybe an improved version next year that actually works and has submission processes and can parse files correctly
