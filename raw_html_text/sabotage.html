                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a bit of a board game geek. A favorite game among myself and my friends is called
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_(game)" rel="nofollow">
                        The Resistance
                    </a>
                    . 5 - 10 players can play - a certain few are designated as "spies". Only spies know for sure who the other spies are, and it's up to the other players to try to deduce who they are before it's too late.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Resistance is a simple enough game that I figured we could do away with the game materials and play the game exclusively via SMS - no issues with phone platforms, browser compatibility, etc.

                <p>
                    Simply text the number and you can invite a group of players to a "Sabotage" game! The service will send all players messages guiding them through the entire game.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Sabotage is essentially a state machine written in ASP.Net. It takes in player input through the SMS provider (Nexmo), parses commands, and advances game state. It persists game state in MSSQL, and the demo project is hosted on an Azure Web App instance.
