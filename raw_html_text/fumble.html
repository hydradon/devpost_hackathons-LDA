                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app that would allow for more natural relationships to develop between users. We were tired of the negativity associated with the current crop of dating apps and wanted to attack it by making conversation fun, flirty, and still, fulfilling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, it matches you with a person that is similar to you in personality. Then, it provides you with quirky pickup lines and a nice topic to start with.

                    Used Cloud9's IDE. HTML+JS+CSS for front end and Node.js for backend.
