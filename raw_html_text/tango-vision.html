                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  20.6 million Americans 18 and older reported vision loss.
        Vision problems are among the top 10 disabilities as reported by the American Foundation for the Blind.

 Worldwide, the World Health Organization estimate 285 million people are visually impaired.

 Think about the family or friends close to you with visual impairment. We want to keep them out of danger while avoiding drawing attention to their disability.

                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>During the Hackathon we got to work with the tablet, but we would like to use the phone armband with the smaller phone sensing device to make Tango Vision more portable.

Tango Vision would expand to the many environmental factors as "Self-Driving People" to take human error out of the equation.
