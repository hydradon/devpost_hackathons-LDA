                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were brainstorming ideas for games when we came up with the idea for a create-own-adventure type of game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The player enters the game and is swept into a storyline that they are directly part of.  The player's decisions will decide what the fate of the character is.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote the entire program on Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While writing the program, I kept running into the problem of certain tasks not carrying out.  After struggling for four hours, I realized I had written the equation wrong.

                    I am proud of improving my Python skills and being able to create a program from just a basic knowledge of the language.
