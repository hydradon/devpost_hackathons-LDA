                    We wanted to do a hardware hack that was helpful for everyone. So we created ColorTrap. ColorTrap is an led ring that will change colors based on a set of speeds and if a certain speed is hit, say 80 MPH, a text will be sent to notify a parent or boss. We built it with a mix of code and hardware. Our biggest challenge was getting the text to be able to send if it hit a certain speed and making the colors correct. We are most proud of its ability to send a text message to a parent or company if the vehicle was going to fast.
