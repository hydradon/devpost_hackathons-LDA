                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The integrity of journalism has been called into question during the past few years. Large media firms have begun to rely on emotion-provoking strategies that focus more on influencing the reader instead of informing them. Informed citizens need a tool to sift through these articles in order to find something closer to the actual experience of the reported event, something closer to the truth.

                <p>
                    PRspective provides a simple, intuitive interface to understand multifaceted issues. We use Google Cloud Services to analyze articles from news organizations around the world and categorize them into simple single sentence summaries. The user can navigate through the multi-opinionated landscape by clicking on the purple button next to the summary. This opens a menu with a list of sources with the same opinion as the summary. By each source is a rating of emotional use in the article, which is generated from GCS Natural Language Processing API. The scale ranges from -1 (very negative) to 1 (very positive). We inform the user of these metrics in order to make them aware of the emotionally charged journalism.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Vue.js to create the frontend of the web service. Firebase served as our database, holding information synthesized by the GCS NLP analysis.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble scraping news sites. While we were marginally successful with CNN using Puppeteer.js, we decided to manually enter our server data in order to save time and generate a working prototype
