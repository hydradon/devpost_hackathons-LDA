                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last year I was in a devastating car accident caused by falling asleep at the wheel late at night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an accelerometer the arduino is able to read in the orientation of the device and when the user's head begins to fall, as if they were slowly nodding off at the wheel, a buzzer is activated until the head returns to an acceptable position.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking an arduino to an accelerometer and a piezo buzzer. The code in the arduino activates the buzzer when an axis value goes above a particular value until the value is within the safe range. We laser cut the case to hold the right and 3D-printed the headset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never worked with a buzzer or accelerometer before so we had to learn what the different pins did and a proper program to calibrate it and give readings. We also laser cut 3 different cases in order to fully fit the rig.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quickly coming up with an idea and fabricating it. This is our first hackathon and we never expected to be able to do something like this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many new commands and libraries in the Arduino IDE and how to laser cut.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Woke
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would hope to shrink down the hardware because an Arduino Uno is too big and not necessary for the purposes of our product. We would also like to directly wire the arduino to the accelerometer and buzzer. Furthermore a compact power source rather than our makeshift battery.
