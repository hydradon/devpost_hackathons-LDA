                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a number of easily observable trends, based on time of the year, in the US Stock Market.  These include things like chocolate companies' stock going up before Halloween and Valentine's day and Hasbro, the toy company, tending to reach its yearly peak right around December 24th.  But what other, less suspected, trends exist in the market? Marc is here to help you find out.

                    Marc is an interactive SMS bot.  Ask marc questions about stock trends and it will do its best to answer you.  Marc is currently implemented in detection of trends in the Dow Jones over the last 10 years.  It can give accurate data about market history for this stock on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Marc uses Twilio API to connect to users through SMS.  Massive CSV files were parsed using python and algorithms were run on the resulting data in Java, to search for trends based on date.  Marc has a beautifully designed web platform to go along with its SMS functionality.

                <h2>
                    Moving Forward
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Marc has the potential to store data on and deploy predictive analytics on any stock.  We felt that Dow Jones would be reliable and more stable than smaller stocks for our proof of concept.  In the future, marc could also be built on more machine learning platforms to cross long time periods of stock data with other types of information like agricultural exports, national debt, and sea levels.  We wanted to implement comparison algorithms between Dow Jones prices and statistics from Data.gov but ran out of time.  This is definitely something that will be added to this project moving forward.
