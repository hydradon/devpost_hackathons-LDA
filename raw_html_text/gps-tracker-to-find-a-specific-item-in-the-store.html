                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Been to the stores(Home Depot, Target, Walmart) and tried to find a specific item and its ends up like an adventure to find a treasure, instead of making it quick and efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Try to take you to the item exactly where it is in the aisle(and bin, Which Row and rack)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm envisioning a simple prototype to have an individualized position tracking chip/barcode/sensors in the item and have an transmitter and receiver component to get you to the item's exact or appropriate location. -------or it could be totally different solution to built and i'm open for it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Haven't started the product yet. But looking forward to it in IoTHackDay. Also, Circling Aisles and asking/questing/request help from employees to locate the exact item.
