                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team mates and I wanted to develop a replacement to the currently implemented project management system at our school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows for students to input their classes, and the assignments, tests, and projects that they have. This populates a calendar view with all of the student's upcoming deadlines. In addition if the student has a group project, the app will allow the user to select the phone numbers of other members in order to create an SMS group-chat
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Android app was developed in Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The implementation of the Twilio SDK required a lot of backend ceremony that we were not prepared for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are prowd that we were able to end up with a functioning Android app, despite the lack of Twilio integration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned good practices with Git,  how to start webservers, how to manage dependencies, developing Android apps, implementing 3rd party SDKs, and how to manage time at hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Oddi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We  hope to further further develop and refine Oddi in order to add more unique features, such as reminding students daily of their agenda.
