                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenge in several developing countries is the ease of collaboration and availability of resources.
Being part of a developing country, we have seen and faced several social issues and could totally relate to this.
It would be amazing to have one unified portal for quick resolution of all social issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prototype:
-Login from facebook
-Pull in information from facebook and get other required details if not already present
-Choose category of the specific issue Ex. Milk Factory
-Get location of all milk banks (pins on google map) based on the applied filters
-People get a list of banks which match the requirement
-User could send message/mail the required organisations
                </p>
                <p>
                    This would be quicker because you can choose those which are much closer to you.
