                    One of our team members grandfathers had Alzheimer's and we wanted to make a system that would remind him about meals and to drink water as well as any social engagements that he may have had that day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Google Home Mini for the interface as it is easy for anyone to use. We used Google Cloud and DialogFlow to control the Google Home and allow it to communicate with the user and to give the user reminders. We then stored the user's data in a MongoDB database. To allow the user to communicate easily we used Twilio to allow the user to send and receive text messages through the Google Home.
