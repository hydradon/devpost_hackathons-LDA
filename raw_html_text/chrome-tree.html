                    Team Notes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Varun and James are foreigners, and had to leave early for various reasons. They are thus not added to this, but are very much part of this team:)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All 4 of us have struggled to keep track of all the tabs we have opened, especially when doing research. We were thinking - how can we automatically, have a map of where our tabs came from and how we should progress through them? Chrome tree is the fruits of our labor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chrome Tree looks for tabs you
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Opened on your own, e.g. "Cmd-T" -&gt; type in URL
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Opened from a link
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    So for the first case, it puts the first webpage you open on your own, as a parent for its own column. Then, for links you open from this parent link, it comes underneath it within the same column.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a chrome extension using Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we want to state up front that we have not managed to get each parent into its own column. Right now we only have one column and all new links goes chronologically downwards. So we struggled with web programming as most of us have never done anything similar. (That being said, we are proud to say we are making it open-source, and will be refining it! Ran out of time in this hackathon to add in all the functionality we wanted).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning about something entirely new! (3 out of 4 of us learnt it from scratch)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making great friends! It was the first time we met each other, and two of our team members are not even from Singapore (in fact, it is their first time here!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to teach and mentor each other; as well as technical web development skills

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Develop its full functionality, and make it available openly, for anyone to edit it and make it fully applicable to niche needs!
