                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Carl Hacks started, we were very excited to work with one of the technologies available to us during the hack. After an intense brainstorming session, we decided to use the Twilio API  to create a game that is easily accessible, fun, engaging, and interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a text based adventure game played via SMS. Users just have to text a phone number to start playing and they will be taken on a text adventure of epic proportions. Standard text rates may apply.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Twilio Java API to respond to messages to the phone number we bought. Tomcat Apache was used to launch a local server and Ngrok was used to expose our local server to the internet. We then coded the process for responses based on a number&rsquo;s input message and its recent history. Our code is written in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time using Twilio so it took some time to figure out how to use it. It was also the first time coding a relatively complex text based algorithm for us. It was a fun challenge to figure out how to represent the data of our story and then implement it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the project as a whole. We feel that this was the perfect project in that it challenged us but was also feasible in 36hrs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a working prototype and players can play our game for an instant source of entertainment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to adapt to an API we had no experience with. We also learned a lot about how to effectively work together as a team and manage a project through GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Texture
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next steps are to figure out an automatic implementation to our data structure that holds the story of the game. Right now, this is hard coded, which is definitely not the best strategy. We also imagine it would be interesting to move our server to an Amazon Web Service.
