                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group was inspired by our common interest in attending social events, but often finding it difficult to find events to actually attend. We recalled a situation where a beloved friend and co-founder of Holinite, was romantically interested in a girl named Emma, and another girl named Holi, but was met with nothing but revolt and disgust - Hence Holinite was born as a method for him to forget about his past traumas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a revolutionary event organising platform which matches event organisers with potential event goers. Event goers can join events by swiping right, indicating interest in attending the event being displayed, or swiping left, discarding the event. Event organisers on the other hand need to swipe right to indicate whether they want a certain individual to attend their event, or swiping left to indicate a disinterest in that individual.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The development of the app was split into two main aspects, the front-end android app development, and the back-end database integration. For the front-end development, Android-Studio was used with the Java language; meanwhile php5 was used for the back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we found it difficult coming up with a possible idea for our hack, but after 3 and a half hours we came up with this idea. Furthermore, due to the lack of previous experience by the majority of our members, we were making quite slow progress.
We therefore decided to split up our team to have 3 members work on front-end development, and 2 members on back-end development. However the two of us working on the back-end had never used Django before, and were trying to learn it. We tried to learn and use Django for the first 13 hours of the hackathon after deciding on our project idea, before deciding to switch to PHP as we couldn't work out how to use Django for what we wanted easily.
Fortunately when we switched to PHP we had a lot more progress, as one of our team members was quite proficient in PHP.
