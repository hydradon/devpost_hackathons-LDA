                    Our program is all designed around texting. This is because everyone has a mobile phone and it is easier to type yes through texting rather than opening an app or website. 
When one person in the team is hungry, they will send out a text to the Twilio number that will trigger the event. Our program will first send out an individual text to each member of the family/team asking if they want pizza. Once a majority has voted yes, the program will automatically order pizza from Domino for home delivery.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had other components that would have leverage Raspberry Pi and CNN to do facial recognition. This would tell the mood if someone is in a hangry mood. Unfortunately, the teammate who had that expertise withdrew the night before the project was due. We had to pivot and scale down our project which in the end may have been a very good thing. This allowed us to focus on working in the logic for polling and decision tree in Twilio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another difficulty we faced was the number of steps required to improve our code in Twilio. If it was simply texting back and forth it was simple to do. However, building the logic and the polling required a lengthy process including working with ngrok, which none of us have used before. We also quickly learned how to set our ports correctly and more importantly how to hide our API keys in GIT. We also had a really good lesson on GIT with status, Add, Commit and Push (in that order).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a team, we
                    <strong>
                        got it done
                    </strong>
                    . Though everyone had different technical skills everyone contributed to the project in different ways. We also learned when to push the metal to the floor and when to step away from the code. We also learned that there is nothing wrong with asking more technical people some pointers when we got stuck on a problem. Given more time, we would have loved to add more functions to the program; however, we also learned to scale down the project when the time was running out. Most importantly, it was a critical morale boost to the team to have the simplest complete project working before tackling adding more features.

                <p>
                    We have a complete working product. There were things we wished we could've added, like more options. However, given the time constraints, putting three complete strangers together as a team, we pulled off something that we all will remember and learn from to

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *Pace the team.  Take plenty of breaks and forgive ourselves often.
*If something doesn't work out, we should try then if that fails quickly work around it.
*Set critical deadlines for features.
*Understand what everyone is doing. We had two teammates doing the same thing trying to solve a problem. What we should've done was work together on it instead of working in separate silos.

                    What's next for our project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a battery-operated Raspberry Pi that with Convoluted Neural Network(CNN) would recognize someone's hungry face, which would then automatically trigger a poll.  Also to add more different options in the polling text and venues ie spaghetti and coca-cola at Cheesecake factory. We also wanted to implement a time check the request against the restaurants operating hours.
