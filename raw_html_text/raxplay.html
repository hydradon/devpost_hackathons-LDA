                    This originally started when two guys combined two separate ideas together, the first idea: Artist networking service and the Second: building a VR social network. It wasn't until we linked up with each at an accelerator program and both saw the potential of where this can go. Literally, it was a matter of being in the right place at the right time. With a shared a vision for building something that can help musical artists in the long run and more importantly building something that is a game changer. The concept of turning the music into video games was unheard of especially combining it with VR/AR and it's solely the reason why we went along with it because we see and believe in the concept potential. AR/VR is the future and we're looking to bring the next generation of art

                <p>
                    We've taken an Empire of The Sun song and built a playable virtual world around it. Complete with objectives and characters, this is a video game incorporating spatial audio and AR gestures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to create the basic level then added gestures we felt went well with the game.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game crashed twice so we constantly had to remake the level. We also had some trouble getting the Bose glasses to work for a while but we thugged it out.

                    Building a playable level and implementing the bose glasses where they affect the world.

                    That technology is quickly evolving and AR opens a new world of possibilities within mobile gaming
