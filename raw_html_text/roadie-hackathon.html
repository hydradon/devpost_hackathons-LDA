                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's say I have a uber popular band in the UK. This summer, we're touring in Poland. Unfortunately, our booker did a crappy job and we ended up in a farm playing EDM for 7 grandmas, 3 pigs and half a cow. We should have known better, right?
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's where Roadie comes in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roadie is designed to help music artists find the best venues when they tour. Unlike other matching platforms, Roadie bases its recommendations on data from streaming services, social media, and other web sources. Music artists can thus perform where they are sure they have an audience.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By mining large amounts of data about artists and venues, Roadie makes use of artificial intelligence techniques to find the most suitable venues and audience for artists. The aim is to enable artists to have an active view of their audience and provide all the tools necessary to optimize their scouting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge comes from the current music market and how it is organized. Event managers or small halls owners design their line-ups based on bookers' recommendations. Artists know that and rely on bookers to find great shows for them. It is based on networking and human interactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As everything human-based, it is imperfect and can lead to mistakes. By making choices based on data, we actually disrupt - and disturb - the current market. Friction to change is strong and remains the main barrier to adopting our solution.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned we should build a solid user acquisition strategy.

                    We plan to work on user onboarding and UX while still feeding the system with more data.
