                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frustrated by the complicated process of gas money repayments, we decided to create DIVID. Because your car runs on fuel, not friendship. With a simple interface to quickly and fairly divide up gas money payments, our application makes it easy and stress-free to share your ride.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DIVID is a mobile app that uses the Mojio API to grab trip data for your vehicle, and then calculates total gas cost using local prices retrieved from a gas price database that is updated in real time. It automatically splits the cost between trip participants and sends out an email with a payment link to repay the driver.
