                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be cool for judges to be able to use it for evaluating various teams
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Evaluation Tool is a program for judges to use to evaluate a group of teams for an event.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the BlueJ IDE and wrote in Java
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started our project in C++ but then realized it would be better to do it in Java. We were originally going to use a Java GUI but ultimately used pop ups instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing on time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to implement pop up boxes and it was our first time collaborating with other people on one project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Evaluation Tool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly adding additional options and a screen to display various statistics based on the input values
                </p>
