                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With new innovative technology being created such as automation and machine learning certain careers are either disappearing or becoming obsolete. Our website is addressing that issue by allowing people to take crash courses on fields that are emerging or thriving.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website allows people to create an account and then complete a crash course in the field that suits their interests and aptitude.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end was designed and built using Bootstrap framework, CSS3, HTML5, and Javascript. The back-end was built using PHP and MySQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unresponsive database due to an invalid connection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a prototype that can clearly portray a concept in about 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cohesiveness is a critical component of back-end development. Also, designing is time-consuming, it fluctuates in different directions when you think you're certain that you've made up your mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Career Crash Course
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For now, CCC is delegated to a concept rather than a successful application of how we can apply our skills to help others. While this project was simply a way to address an issue that is becoming more and more relevant in society, this kind of approach to the future of jobs can benefit many people.
