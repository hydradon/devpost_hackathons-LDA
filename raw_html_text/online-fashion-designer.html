                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A problem many people run into is not knowing what to wear when they wake up in the morning. We wanted to combat this problem by creating a program that matches pieces of clothing for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a user interactive website where the user inputs a piece of clothing that they own, and the program generates three options for possible outfit ideas based on what they entered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program was built using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major challenges we ran into was sorting out the different possibilities and options of inputs the user could give us and coming up with complementary pieces of clothing for each.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that this project is original and successfully solves a big problem in society.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that making a website requires patience, and may be a lot harder than it looks. We learned many new technical aspects of web development languages that we didn't know before, and also how to use GitHub.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some ideas to implement in the future are getting the user to upload a picture and the program to respond the same way that it does now.
