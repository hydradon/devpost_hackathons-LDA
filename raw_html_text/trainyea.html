                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hackathon theme set the basic idea and we bounced ideas to each other mostly revolving around issues that we had with the CTA.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Capacity Tracker System keeps track of train congestion down to the individual carts

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Back-end was built on Java, server on MySQL, and front end uses php, JavaScript, and html
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Structuring how our overall system would flow with each other
back-end to server pushing
php to JavaScript

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program in languages that we were unfamiliar with. We came together and managed to manage each other as a team
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning different languages
How to push to a SQL database from java

                    What's next for the CTACTS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If this idea were to be developed further we would actually install sensors on the CTA lines and maybe even counters that more accurately keep track of the people
