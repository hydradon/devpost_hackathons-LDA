                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all wanted to do something cool and fun with Clarifai, this is what we came up with!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    generate captions for pictures based on setting and the emotions of the people in the picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clarifai and project-oxford api calls built on top of an ASP MVC web app deployed on Azure. Data processing and algorithms done by R scripts leveraging the Machine Learning on Azure..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Terrible time consuming problems with async api calls and memory streams of image files. Due to these problems we were unfortunately unable to fully deliver our MVP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the extreme setbacks we were able to build our own C# wrapper for Clarifai which is pretty cool. We might not have been able to present how we wanted to, but we still think this is a great idea and plan to move forward with it outside of the hackathon
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A ton about APIs, machine learning, and making async function calls
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Magicaption
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This deadline absolutely does not mark the end of Magicaption. We have 100% plans to turn this into a real thing in the near feature.
