                    Our world has been revolutionized by the expediency of emergency services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply dialing 9-1-1 offers an array of services for people throughout the United States with response times as little as 3 minutes. However, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, discrepancies in communication with 9-1-1 dispatchers has accounted for an average increase in dispatch communication by 11 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In that 11 minute span, a dangerous situation could be thwarted, a house fire could be put out, or a life could be saved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We, the Help team, challenge you to imagine the safety, security, and vitality of a police response, ambulance, or fire engine at your fingertips. Simply turn your phone's location on, and the app provides you with a report of nearest fire departments, police stations, and hospitals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you ever encounter a situation that requires any of the aforementioned services, you have the option of immediately alerting them through GPS dispatch, the technology operated by 9-1-1 operators throughout the United States. With your location in their hands, communication lies in SMS, preventing any discrepancy that results in a longer communication time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One touch of a button--one app--can save lives like never before.
