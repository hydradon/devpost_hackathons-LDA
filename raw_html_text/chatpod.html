                    ChatPod lets users communicate based on the content their looking at. When you open ChatPod, you're connected with users that are browsing the same website as you. ChatPod is a unique experience because you can live chat with communities that don't have/use a chat application. (A great example is talking with people that are reading the same news article as you)

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ChatPod is built with Node.js WebSockets as a backend and a Chrome Web Extension on the frontend. We built this application from the ground up in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was switching from Java to Node.js for the WebSocket server. We had issues getting things off the ground with Java and decided that we needed to switch quickly. After switching, we accomplished all the goals we planned.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about web extensions and how to communicate with a WebSocket backend.
