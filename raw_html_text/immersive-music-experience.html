                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to simulate immersive music experiences that would soothe and relax the mind!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile virtual reality application brings you into this virtual room with some records and a record player. You choose a record and drop it into the player and enjoy the music with ambiance immersion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using unity and c# to create a google cardboard application. We used the google vr sdk and the android sdk to make full use of unity tied to its VR capabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulties with designing and creating/finding 3d models for the virtual room. Most of all, the hardest challenge was to finally implement the c# code in unity which we had no previous experience with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating and compiling a virtual room that looks decent and can play music at the start, while having no experience in the VR world, Unity and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot about coding VR applications, especially using the Unity program. And we had the chance to learn C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Immersive Music Experience
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to polish the design of the virtual room, have multiple scenarios (disco, classic, rock, hip-hop, vapor wave...) all with their different designs that pop and make the user feel in another world. We want to possibly incorporate history into the immersive music experience. History in the way, we would present images, videos that correlate to the history of a song, its period that it alludes to. Hence providing a relaxing, educational and immersive experience to the user.
