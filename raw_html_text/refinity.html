                    More than 8 million tons of plastic is dumped into the ocean every year. We want that number to be zero. We are seeking to Accomplish this through ReFinity, an app that reimagines reuse and recycling. ReFinity will reward users for using our specially designed containers and returning them to our specially designed trash cans. The cointainers will use RFID technology to quickly scan many items quickly and dispose them in in an enviromentally friendly way.

                    For this hackathon, we began on the development of the app, using HTML and Javascript and using Apache Cordova to convert it into an Android Application. We are using google cloud's firebase to store logins,accounts and the amout of credit associated with that account.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Everything we did was new territory to us, Converting the webapp into Android using apache cordorva was one of the most challenging especially because Cordova has some bugs that we need to workaround and also learning about firebase.

                    Next we need to build the hardware side of our product, the scanner and containers.
