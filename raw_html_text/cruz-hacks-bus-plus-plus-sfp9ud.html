                    Frustrated with a lack of crucial information on transit apps?  Have you ever been in a time sensitive situation in which you could not spare seconds rushing for information that should have been made front and center, e.g. bus ETA to a desired stop, information about level of activity during peak hours, precise geospatial location of transit vehicles particularly when routes go in multiple/branching directions, etc?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making an application that organizes transit information in such a way that
                    <strong>
                        respects the user's time
                    </strong>
                    is of huge importance.  There are many instances where the way ordinary schedule information displayed at the stop or uploaded was either designed too confusingly or too cumbersome to digest when in reality the user just wanted very specific details, such as what is the closest arriving bus relative to the stop closest to them.

                    A large benefit of the open source community is that when one has started such a project that benefits the community but cannot continue, many are allowed to "stand on the shoulders of giants" as Isaac Newton put it, and continuing the work.  BusRoutePlusPlus was made in exactly that spirit.  Continuing on the prior work of SlugRoute, we built upon and fleshed out entirely new features such as give an intuitive user interface built on modern technologies such as React, from which displays and organizes readily available information about bus stop information and the next bus, such as geospatial coordinates that provides up to date information about the bus's location relative to the user, a heat-map that informs the user of levels of peak activity, an ETA for the next bus with respect to the stop nearby to the user, etc.  All this information organized in such a way that can be discovered quickly without requiring time taken to sift through for example, a long list of schedules and times.
