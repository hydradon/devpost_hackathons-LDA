                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People have some pretty bad speech habits. We're here to correct that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A mounted arm will raise up and slap you in the face if you say too many trigger words (such as "like").
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use Google cloud's voice recognition API to detect trigger words. Communicate with an Arduino to drive the appropriate motors when a slap is needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried using a Raspberry Pi at first, but it was too slow for the voice processing, so we had to move over to doing the voice processing on a computer and then the motor controls on an Arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Raspberry Pi's don't have spectacular processing power. Testing should happen sooner in case things break.
                </p>

                    What's next for You like jazz?

                <p>
                    Better mobility (right now it's tied down by power supplies and a computer).
