                    We brain stormed for a while and actually came up with a  decent idea but the lack of hardware forced us to think a lot more. We ended up going with IOT and the budget because we wanted to do something with hardware. The amazon echo was challenging but tony got through it, and the pebble was nice to use. We ended up creating what I think is a pretty cool idea.
