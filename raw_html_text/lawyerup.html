                    Recent federal research has shown that one of the most common impedances for access to justice remains financial burden: lawyers cost a lot of money, and the majority of people cannot afford to retain a lawyer for the full time that they require one;  and, furthermore, legal expenditures are estimated to cost the Canadian general public over $7.7b p/a (this amounts to roughly 10% of the average household spending in Canada @ $6100 / $75,443) (Farrow et al., 2016).  According to anecdotal evidence proffered by Tomas Sande, a (insert type of lawyer) lawyer in Argentina, many people choose not to pursue litigation because they feel that they don&rsquo;t have a chance of winning, and that fighting for their rights would be prohibitively expensive.

                    Based on these facts, we think that a general public benefit can be derived from the creation of a tool that would allow for the average person to judge the potential benefits of litigation, so that they can weigh their options more carefully, and make better judgements regarding pursuing litigation in support of their rights and liberties.
