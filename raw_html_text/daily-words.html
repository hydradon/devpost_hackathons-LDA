                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a kid, I personally did not like reading/English as it was not my strong suit. I would dread the moments my parents made me read more books. Little did I know how useful the English language is, and how influential it is in our society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created Daily Words in hope to improve children's vocabulary and only taking less than a minute of their day!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply ask Daily Words for the "Word of the Day" and it will prompt back the word and the definition. The "word of the day" will be a new word everyday. It will automatically end once it prompts the word once.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Daily Words utilizing Python, Alexa SDK, and beautifulsoup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both of us were not familiar with Alexa SDK and had trouble becoming comfortable with the environment itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of completing a fully functional Alexa skill! We accounted for all of the possible utterances and outcomes we could think of to ensure it would be kid friendly. In addition, we're proud of being able to learn more about Alexa SDK and what it has to offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating this application truly forced us to understand how Alexa works as a system. We learned a lot about Alexa SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Daily Words
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main upcoming change to look out for in Daily Words is a favorite function. We plan to use a database to store these "words", and will allow users to be able to retrieve them utilizing Alexa.
