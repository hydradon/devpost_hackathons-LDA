                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    came when saw raw plastic waste being dumped into landfill totally destroying the soil fertility and when people living in kacchi abadis are relocated and their homes are bulldozed and destroyed .
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We collect plastic dump, recycle it and convert it into a dismantlable, portable shelters. Our aim is to protect the soil from plastic dumps (non-biodegradable) as well as provide low cost shelter solutions for nomads. People can carry their homes with them everywhere they go.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    &bull; Plastic is melted and molded into foldable panels.
&bull; These panels can be interconnected through joints
&bull; A shelter of 7 feet by 14 feet area is formed by fitting all the pieces together.
