                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to be able to connect with friends nearby or see what events were happening in our area and who was attending. The world is constantly moving and you're so busy that you don't have the time to text everyone what you're doing when. With friend-zone, that issue becomes a thing of the past as it allows you to see who's doing what and when they're doing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Friend-Zone allows you to set up a circular position on google maps to use geospatial indexing and then searches if any other user or event is within the area of your circle and if there is, it tells you about the event occuring and who's going. This allows you to see when friends are nearby and allows users to catch up or attend an event together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MongoDB to built the database in the backend server that stores a geospatial index of users, events, and venues. We then used HTML, CSS, and javascript for the front end of the website to give it a nice design and functionality. Apache, CGI, and Python were used as the server side languages of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few challenges transfering the data from the server to the front end. Another challenge we had was converting the radius we obtained using google maps api into a latitude and longitude in order to use an intersection feature to see who and what shared an area with you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have been able to convert the database input into latitude and longitude positions so we can find areas of interest that users and venues share. We're also proud to have started this project from scratch and have a full functioning website with all the functions that we intended for it to have.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement googles map API in manu different ways and how to connect data from front end to the back end server. We also learned some MongoDB.
                </p>

                    What's next for Friend-Zone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To draw circles to see all the events occuring, make the gui work better, and provide a messaging system.
