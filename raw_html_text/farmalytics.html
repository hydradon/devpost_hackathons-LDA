                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a
                    <strong>
                        big drought in southern India
                    </strong>
                    right now, and many
                    <strong>
                        farmers are killing themselves due to this
                    </strong>
                    . This moved us, and so we thought we could help them by building an app for letting them efficiently grow crops to support the economy and every human being. Any job, no matter what, demands the food to survive. This food comes from farmers, therefore
                    <strong>
                        farming is the most important job in the world
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It asks farmers for the input of the crop they would like to plant, asks for what month and also asks for what state(out of the tri-state area). Then it recommends what course of action the farmer should take based on the climate conditions needed for the crop to grow, and the average climate conditions of the chosen month.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using HTML and Node.JS, JQuery, Ajax,=

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into were the visualization with the HTML and the JS code and the remote server hookup

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have  fixed all our js bugs, which were difficult to identify. Furthermore, we were successfully able to use comparative analysis through node.js using a variety of different functions and logic methods.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use JS to integrate web apps, how to output data from HTML to Node.js, and how to use radio buttons in HTML to take user input.

                    What's next for FarmAlytics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can expand this idea to the whole USA and beyond, eventually helping farmers all over the world with agricultural maintenance.
