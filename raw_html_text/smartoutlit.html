                <p>
                    Electric bill.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reduces energy waste and protects the environment.  It monitors power consumption of all devices plugged into the outlet.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A wireless Arduino board (SAMN) reads a current sensor. This wireless data is received by a W5500 Ethernet board that post it to a Firebase. A Website then shows you this data
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenge: Correctly identifying our challenge. 
Solution: At first we thought one of our key sensors, the current sensor, was broken. Calamity ensued as we tried to rush order a new part. Come to find out we misdiagnosed the issue! What we actually had a was a calibration issue. The sensor was fine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenge: Calibrating the current sensor to correctly read and report the values.
Solution: Read the datasheet and test response time
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenge: Time management 
Solution: Still working on it. (Redbull and not sleeping helps.)

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not giving up. It was incredibly tempting to quit the idea since the key component failed (or so we thought-- actually just needed calibrating) but we really believed in it and stuck through. It worked out for us because of this.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The importance of looking at a problem from various points of view. Without this we would have never understood that what our sensor actually needed is calibration.
