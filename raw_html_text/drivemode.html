                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CineMode by Cinemark that allows users to receive rewards for turning their phones to "CineMode" during movies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app would be hooked up to a user's bank account. It allows the user to put their iPhone in "DriveMode." This prevents user interaction with the screen. The only other forms of input are the hardware buttons. If the user presses the Home button this is interpreted as distracted driving and donates a dollar to "Mothers Against Distracted Driving" for every second they are not in the app. If the phone powers off or locks automatically the DriveMode will continue as if it would if the app was still open.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The envisioned idea included connecting with the vehicle's bluetooth to determine if the user was in the car or not. This would know when to stop DriveMode as bluetooth has a distance limit. Once the connection is lost DriveMode would end and the user would receive one banking reward point for every second they were in DriveMode. DriveMode can also be turned off within the app by tapping the stop button.
                </p>

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    In Xcode with OBJ-C

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Bluetooth devices not connecting
APIs were buggy
Swift vs OBJ-C
Getting Different Application States

                <p>
                    The app works as intended although without any fancy api connectivity and bluetooth

                    Less buggy and more polished version?
