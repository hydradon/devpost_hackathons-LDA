                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When my mum heard I can actually code, she asked me to try and write something like this, which would be a useful tool for her, since she's a chemistry teacher, and she could use this to help her students learn the names of chemical compounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project has a rudimentary GUI which allows the input of a formula in a textbox. After pressing the button, the scientific name of the formula is displayed, as well as another additional piece of information about the compound: whether it is an acid, base, oxide or ionic compound.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used mostly arrays(for storing and accessing the data) and regular expressions(for identifying the different types of compounds).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Conventions such as the name of nonmetal oxides needing to specify the number of oxygen atoms in the molecule(for example NO2,
                    <em>
                        nitrous dioxide
                    </em>
                    ), as opposed to metal oxides(MgO-
                    <em>
                        magnesium oxide
                    </em>
                    , Al2O3-
                    <em>
                        aluminum oxide
                    </em>
                    ).

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am extremely proud of this project in its entirety.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use regular expressions, and how to name chemical compounds in English.

                    What's next for Chemical Compound Namer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More information about the given compound could be returned, like the type of molecule it has, or the valence electrons of each atom. Another improvement could be implementing a database for organic chemistry compounds.
