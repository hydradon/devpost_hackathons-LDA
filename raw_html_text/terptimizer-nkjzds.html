                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We detected a frustrating problem on our College Park campus concerning schedule crafting.  It is an unavoidable duty of every student, and we desire to make it a more pleasant experience for all.  It proves very helpful for students to actually create an outline of their preferred schedules before having to commit by registering for classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Terptimizer is a play on words for "Terp Optimizer," a website designed to calculate potential schedules and provide options for students prior to having to lock-in on their desired courses one-by-one.  It was intended to have several additional features such as course-time preference and potential free-days, but unfortunately, we were not able to implement these due to a lack of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split the job evenly between front-end (stylistic and functional) to back-end (code-heavy and logical).  One of the front end members worked on the input page, while the other worked on the output page, and the two coincided to connect these pages to the back-end code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of our group members were familiar with front-end web development, so two of us were forced to spend the majority of our time simply learning the requisite languages.  Furthermore, we experienced significant difficulties with transmitting data from front-end to back-end due to our lack of familiarity with the languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our individual successes in both back-end code logic and front-end design, given the short amount of time we were given to learn the necessary languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a great deal about the importance of preparation, time allocation, duty distribution, and many useful things about coding itself from out first Hackathon.  We hope to continue to learn from seeing the works of other teams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Terptimizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to our unfortunate lack of time and experience, we were not able to put everything we had into this project, but we hope to finish this project and add the features we desired in order to create an improved schedule builder for College Park students.
