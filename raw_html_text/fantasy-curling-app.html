                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fantasy sports as a whole have created a huge demand for an increased investment experience for the individual fan. Since the beginning of Fantasy Football in 1962 with the Greater Oakland Professional Pigskin Prognosticators League, the way fans interact with their sport has been modified and mutated to a point where even the most diehard fans can be found rooting for their bitter rivals. This demand has exploded with the advent of faster, high speed internet and social media, and the Fantasy Sports market becomes more lucrative by the year. However, even with this boom, there are unexplored markets in some of the most exciting sports, with the winter sport Curling leading the way. We were inspired to bridge the gap between the insatiable demand of hardcore curling enthusiasts growing market. By bridging this gap, we hope to not only increase the enjoyment of curling fans, but the well-being of the human race as a whole.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our language of choice was Java, and we utilized the Javax.swing package for front-end development. The JApplet utilizes a vast amount of java components to give the user an eye-friendly layout. For back-end, we made use of various elements of Java including, but not limited to, ArrayLists, HashTables, and Scanners.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Along the way, we encountered various challenges. Our knowledge of these java components was less than ideal, so this was truly a learning experience for our team.
