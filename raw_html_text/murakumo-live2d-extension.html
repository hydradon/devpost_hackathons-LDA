                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because manga usually consists of thin vertical strips, the space on the sides are often unused. We wanted to fill in that space with an animated digital character that accompanies you while you read and responds to your actions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overlay web pages in Google Chrome with an animated digital character that detects and responds to cursor movement and clicks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used existing Live2D WebGL libraries to animate layered 2-dimensional digital art, turning the digital artwork from a still image into an animated figure. We then overlaid it on web pages, and packaged the project as an extension in Google Chrome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nobody on the team knew JavaScript prior to this project, so we had to learn it on the fly. Cross-origin resource sharing was also hard to work with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to make a fully functional product in roughly 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use JavaScript and Live2D.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Murakumo Live2D Google Chrome Extension
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're trying to add speech functionality through audio and speech bubble (text) options. We're also looking into adding support for more characters, since at the moment we only feature Murakumo from Kancolle.
