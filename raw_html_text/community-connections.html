                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that would help the community, and we decided to create a simple, easy-to-use platform to connect people interested in volunteering with available opportunities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Community Connections allows volunteers to find opportunities either based on their geographic location or their interests. It also allows organizations to find volunteers for events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up the basic logic of the app with PowerPoint, to make sure it was easy to use. Then we programmed our ideas into MATLAB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PowerPoint does not allow the user to input data when it is in presentation mode. Fortunately, MATLAB does, so we were able to solve that problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we developed a solid foundation for an app at our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Community Connections
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more time and practice, hopefully we will be able to develop Community Connections into an actual working app for Android, Apple, or both.
