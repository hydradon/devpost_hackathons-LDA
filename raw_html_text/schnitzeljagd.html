                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is a diverse team from all around the world. We found it difficult to agree upon a practical social cause to pursue so we decided to embrace the festive season with a geolocation based game. We wanted to inspire people explore the world in a new and fun way. Inspired by the infamous Pokemon Go, Mymapoly challenges adventurers to compete with their friends and family exploring new territory in the real world to unlock virtual property to buy in the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players are invited to create a game of Mymapoly by selecting a map from their local city and inviting friends and family to the game. Thereafter, players will continue a regular game of monopoly however before users are able to purchase a property in the game they have to have been there in real life. The game encourages tourism and gamifies learning about history, culture and travel. It also gives people the motivation to get out of their houses and walk around, which leads to an extra fitness factor. Once a field is unlocked, a window opens up and shows a short text about important information about that particular place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To create the feature that enables players to unlock new properties in the game we used TomTom API's. First we created a TomTom geofencing API key, admin key and project. Secondly we cloned the geofencing creator API to create geofences on our map. Then we created an object using a post request to our service. This object is a marker on the map that represents our player. We will know when a player crosses a geofence area because that object will be present in the geofence transition history when we send a get request to the geofence API. We used React to create the user interface by manipulating an existing repository for the game of monopoly in the browser. We added some addition game logic using JSX. If the player tries to unlock a property permanently, a request will be sent to TomTom APIs to identify whether the object (the player) has been to the location in the real world. If they have not the property will remain locked. If they have it will be permanently unlocked.
                </p>
