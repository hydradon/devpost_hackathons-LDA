                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I stumbled on a twitter thread titled, Become Beyonce's assistant don't get fired; it's was twitter thread designed like a choose your adventure story game, readers had to click a tweet they thought was the correct answer to a question in order to move on to the next question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However if you failed in the process, Queen Bee will send her lawyers to hand you a termination letter ASAP.
I thought it was fun so I started tinkering on the  idea of possibly turning this into a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game consists of questions with multiple options in which one of them is the right answer, this questions are basically Beyonce related, so you need to know a thing or two about Beyonce to eventually make it to the final question and claim your badge of victory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, you can get to play popup mini games to improve your score at different periods in the game. At the end you can share your assistant badge on social media and also challenge your friends to play the game.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Time was one major challenge, because we assembled a team quite late and it was really difficult to carry everybody along during that process.

                <p>
                    It's 5 am my local time, deadline day and I am still trying to fill this form in order to submit. If you asked me 24 hours ago if I'd go on to submit this, I will tell you I was unmotivated but not submitting was not an option. Sounds funny, but challenging my fears is one accomplishment I am really proud of.
