                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The recent change in weather has brought to attention of how severe global warming is. With recent news about 2030, we felt the need to make an effort to spread the news and educate people how to live sustainability.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides an educational game for users to learn more about recycling for the first chapter
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with swift(xcode) using spritekit and gameplaykit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time that we use xcode to make a game, so we ran into a lot of problems when trying to implement a certain animation of the game. We don't have actual game created due to the time constraint
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were satisfy about the design of the intro part of the game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learn to use xcode to design a game, and to look for answers only whenever we encountered a bug or something we don't know how to do
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Recovery-Hackathon-project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make this an educational game, that has different chapters to teach the users(mainly the new generations )about actions to take to help fix some of the issues and concern we have for the world.
