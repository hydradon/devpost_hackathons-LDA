                    Inspiration To try and Market the Flir One to as many people as possible and enable people who dont have one to experience what it is like to use it.

                <h2>
                    How it works This is a actually a complicated question. We are using several Technologies such as Blob storage for our saving of pictures, a SQL DB for form data and analytical data, we host our API in the cloud too in order for our FLIR ONE application AND Web Application to speak to it.

                    Challenges I ran into (Setting up blob storage, saving streams, Java development as neither of us are Java developers it was a challenge working with such technology but it is always a learning experience at hackathons and so we took each challenge step by step and worked through these problems
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of Blob storage, Flir ONE Application (Android) and the fact that we have a working prototype of all this within 2 days.

                <h2>
                    What I learned We learned about Java applications, thinking about problems not only from a how can it be done but why should it and what can we do to make this amazing technology available to the masses.

                <p>
                    Whats next is polish. since we have something that actually works our next step is to polish the application and release it for free. we plan to monetize this application through advertising.
