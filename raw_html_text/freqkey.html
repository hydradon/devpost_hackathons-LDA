                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find a new alternative to Bluetooth for info transmission
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It transmits byte code between devices through frequency key mapping, and we wanted to have it work through Apple watch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by creating a sound file that would be synced to a file, and have a receiver on the other end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found a race condition big in WatchOS2, so we failed to play a file from the apple watch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saving the buffer data into a file required a lot of low-level system magic
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never develop with systems currently in beta.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Freqkey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Remake it once Apple releases their bug fix.
                </p>
