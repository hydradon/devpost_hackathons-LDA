                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to the culptivating presentation on our water supplies, we were moved to try to make a change by making an educational game such can inform students what they can do to stop pollution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So, you&rsquo;re this super cool dude who a solouton for everyone&rsquo;s huge problem. Water pollution! Yo, have made an ingenious plan, to collect all the fillthy rubbish that happens to find itself, in our rivers. You, re the guardian of the rivers.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We imported pygame, and worked up form there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pause button, because it wouldn&rsquo;t unpuase. And that&rsquo;s only scratching the surface of our tall tales of game d&eacute;veloppement.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Finishing on time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that pause buttons are an evil existence of computing, which lives soley to make us miserable.

                    What's next for Save The River
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can make it into an app, and use custom images(improving graphic design)
