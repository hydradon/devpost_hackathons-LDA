                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The unfortunate truth is that many disabled people see themselves as burdens to those who assist them. We wanted to create a way for people who need assistance to find it while also giving back something meaningful to their helpers. This could be anything from teaching them about a language or skill they have, to having a pleasant conversation about something they're both interested in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web/mobile platform we established allows people seeking help to describe their requests and also themselves, to show what they can offer to helpers. It matches volunteers nearby according to their requests and times, and allows them to meet up and have a meaningful 2-way exchange.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web app back end with Python and hosted it with Flask, and used DigitalOcean and Domain.com to deploy. We built the front end with Bootstrap and React. We used Docker to manage dependencies. We sent emails using a library called Flask Emails.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took a lot of time to conduct research and decide which obstacle we wanted to address to benefit disabled people, and how we would address it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was also difficult to collaborate because of different software environments and skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a unique idea: the first platform for facilitating meaningful 2-way exchanges between those in need of help and those looking to help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea is easily scalable and can reach a large portion of the population.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to send emails through Flask, use Docker to make collaboration easier, and create web apps with React. We also learned about many of the problems people with disabilities face and what we can do to improve their lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Give n Gain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to flesh out the interface further and allow for users to input what they learned or experienced from their Give n Gain exchanges to get more people to become volunteers and get more people in need to seek it.
