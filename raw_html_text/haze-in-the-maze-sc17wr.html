                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all freshmen in the same python programming class so we are new to programming. Our main objective we were looking for is something simple we have learned from the class but would be a great learning experience for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A funny choose your own adventure through a maze of death.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using if and else statements and python functions to direct your way through the maze or to a possible death.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't get the program to restart from the beginning when you died. Also we tried a while loop but couldn't get past the first move.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to finish it and get it working as our first hackathon program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Different functions in python language.
                </p>

                    What's next for Haze in the Maze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing really. Just a short fun game to play.
                </p>
