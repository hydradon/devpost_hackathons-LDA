                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started this because I'm very bad about wearing my retainer and it's caused a prolonged treatment that was completely unnecessary. It makes the process fun and causes people to be a little bit less prone to forgetfulness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RetainIt shows your retainer streak and allows you to get bonus points as well as access facts about healthy teeth maintenance.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a login API to use in google app engine which we eventually could not use because we couldn't get the google app engine to work due to billing info issues. We couldn't really get google app engine to run so we had to learn how to install and use Heroku which took a bit for us. Ultimately we took a lot of time trying to upload as a web app versus trying to grind at the back end facets.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we lost a team member due to sickness, we're proud of completing our first hackathon! It took a while to remake a new idea and try to implement it and play around with workshop ideas, but it's our first webapp.

                    What's next for RetainIt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to interact with others, reminders being implemented, maybe developing a mobile app version. We also hope to find a way to install points and levels that can be associated with each login
