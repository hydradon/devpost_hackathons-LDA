                    It all started from the moment we heard about the cyber anti-harassment focus during the opening ceremony of hackgt 2016. We decided that this is an area which is of prime importance. Many people across the country and across the world, especially teenage kids are vulnerable to this kind of cyber bullying and harassment.

                    Our project is a google chrome extension. This chrome extension called SUDO STOP_ABUSE will make you, as 'parents'
                    <b>
                        aware
                    </b>

                    <br>
                    Once you install this chrome extension and enter the parent's desired contact information(email-id), it will start monitoring your child's facebook post, messages and comments on the posts that he is tagged in.

                <p>
                    The Facebook graph API was used to read
                    <b>
                        posts and comments
                    </b>
                    pertaining to a user's account in a
                    <b>
                        non-intrusive way
                    </b>
                    (such that children/teens wouldn't even know its running) and is classified as either abusive or not using the Bark Partner API (
                    <a href="https://partner.bark.us/" rel="nofollow">
                        https://partner.bark.us/

                    ).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The reason for choosing this API was the level of detail about a text that is returned -
                    <b>
                        Abusive or not, in what context(profanity, abuse etc.) and level of abuse(likely, very_likely etc.)
                    </b>
                    .
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We used a
                    <b>
                        PHP
                    </b>
                    backend server that serves the page behind the extension which refreshes at frequent pre-set intervals monitoring new content from the facebook feed.
                    <br>
                    Tech used in building the extension:
                    <b>
                        JSON, HTML, JS, PHP
                    </b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We also trained our own model for text(harassment/not) classification using scikit-learn (Vectorizing - TfIdf - Support Vector Machine) pipeline with Grid Search for optimization and trained on #HackHarassment data(

                    <br>
                    Our model significantly out performs the benchmark given in

                    . (Precision - 0.90, Recall - 0.88). (#Note: Possible overfitting due to small amount of bad_corpus available.)
We could not integrate this model in the application due to time constraints.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These are the challenges we ran into while developing the extension.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Facebook only allows apps/extensions which have not yet been reviewed to
                        <u>
                            request for only posts and comments related to the user
                        </u>
                        . It does not allow us to access the inbox of the user without us submitting our extension to Facebook. After 3-7 business days, Facebook will grant permission to your app to access inbox. So currently, we are limited to finding harassing posts
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We used the bark api to find out whether a sentence is abusive in nature. But we ran into
                        <u>
                            "CORS issue. No &lsquo;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&rsquo;"
                        </u>
                        which made it impossible for us to access their api from our server. This was a web security issue and we circumvented this by sending a curl request through php.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In most cases, even after reporting abuse, Facebook would be able to handle the case within 72 hours and
                    <i>
                        remove
                    </i>
                    the post. In rare and serious cases, Facebook will inform law enforcement agencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, As Facebook explains:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of the diversity of our community, it's possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you without meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer personal controls over what you see, such as the ability to hide or quietly cut ties with people, Pages, or applications that offend you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, using the extension,
                    <b>
                        a friend/peer/family knows about the situation/issue that the victim is going through and is able to provide support
                    </b>
                    . Moreover, in cases of children, it is vital that
                    <b>
                        their parents know what their kids see and share, if not receive, in social media
                    </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The extension detects any potential harassment and reports it to the designed point of contact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important accomplishment is the satisfaction of potentially supporting what could be millions of users on facebook and
                    <b>
                        providing them moral support which can not be quantitatively valued
