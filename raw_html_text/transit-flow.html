                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt the challenge of finding an optimum route in a limited timeframe was extremely challenging.  However, if we did find the optimum route, how would we gauge and analyze the actual benefit of that route? Rather than propose a single solution that may or may not be an improvement, we decided to build an easy to use, interactive tool that would help design and test multiple routes and identify actual improvements.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transit Flow allows the Staten Island MTA Planning Commission to add or remove stops for both local and express lines in a draggable and interactive mapping environment and understand how these changes will influence passenger wait times.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Google BigQuery, Google Maps, and data end points from MTA which include ONS, OFFS, Leave_Load, Act_ARR, ACT_LV, among others.  Essentially, we used those end points to understand the weighted average time between two stops and developed an algorithm to understand what would happen in terms of wait time if you added or removed a stop from either the express or local bus stops.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Time was the biggest challenge.
