                        The "create" command will create a new Game and store it in the Games Pool. When successful, it will return a HTTP 200 code and the Game Rules JSON (mentioned in the General Rules topic). The difference of this create command from the one of Single Player Mode is that this one can receive a Proposed Game Rules Object which has a "password" property, that allows you to inform the password you want to be used in the game. You can see the object description bellow:

                    3. If you could change something about this challenge, what would it be?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    I did it. In the challenge mode I made the game customizable. You can set available characters if you want to. You can also decide the size of the password, if it will have repeated characters or not. I could have made it available on Single Player and Multiplayer modes also, but I was afraid it could have drained too much of my time. Maybe I'll do it after a few days.

The project was based on

                    The project was made with Maven. Go to the directory where the pom.xml file is located and run the command bellow in the command line.

                    Why, in the Challenge Mode, did you allow the user that is creating the game to provide a password with letters that are not in the "allowed" list?

                <p>
                    For two simple reasons:

                    <li>
                        I wanted the API to respond the most "unbreakable" way, avoiding error messages and HTTP codes different from the 200 (OK).
