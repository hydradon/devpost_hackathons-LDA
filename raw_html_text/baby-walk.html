                    Baby-Walk is a robotic device used to aid infants while they are developing walking skills. The robot walks backwards, holding a treat, which serves the purpose of motivating the baby. Using an ultrasonic sensor, the robot is able to detect when a baby has fallen, in which it will stop and give the treat to the baby as a motivation. This device makes the process of walking easy for babies and for parents.
