                    We were inspired by the captivating novel written by Mary Shelly and the puzzling escape games played when we first used a computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an escape game, we created an interactive environment that challenges the user with different puzzles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We designed a map and made our own pixel art style graphics for the game which then had to be resized for it to match the screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we ran into was miscommunication, which lead to a lot of unnecessary complications. Another one was deciding on what art style we would use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the pixel art graphics that we made ourselves instead of just importing images from the internet. We're also proud of the teamwork during this hackathon, as we distributed the work evenly between the different members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, we aim to improve Fronk by implementing detailed graphics, a more complex storyline, and adding much harder puzzles and challenges.
