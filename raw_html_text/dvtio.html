                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested in diving into data science, and we have always found those "number of people killed per capita versus internet explorer usage rates" graphs funny, so we set out to build a tool to find those for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to build a general tool for finding data that appears correlated - we attempt to accomplish this by looking for similar trend lines among all uploaded data. When uploading data, we need to parse potentially large datasets, build trendlines, and store that data on the machine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using d3.js for visualizations, a nodejs backend, and mysql for quick database lookups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've never used mysql before, or d3.js. It was also one of our member's first time using nodejs. And Zak insisted upon using a code linter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's a lot of things that need to be done to make sure that data actually matches, like matching up date ranges, better trend fitting, and generally just getting more data into the system.
