                </h2>
                <p>
                    Giving is hard. What if it didn't have to be? Connecting with the community can prove even more difficult. What if it didn't have to be? Enter The Pantry, an online platform that connects helpers to those in need.
                </p>

                    Our online platform gives users the ability, not only to donate at the click of a button, but also to choose exactly what food and essential items they are able to donate with ease.

                    The platform is built with the React framework and Google Map and Places API integration on a Node.js server.

                    Different experience levels, which really ended up being a good thing. We all learned so much from each other regardless of our knowledge coming in Saturday morning.
