                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off as an accounting firm that utilised cloud accounting software. We quickly realised that the internal reporting capabilities of cloud accounting software were not very visual and required tons of effort to get insights from the data. We found ourselves exporting to Excel, building graphs and spending a lot of time trying to produce a professional document for each client every month. This inspired us to create our own reporting tool that would enhance our client's experience and understanding. In addition, we wanted to increase the efficiency of generating our clients monthly management accounts. As with most things that turn out to be useful, other people also wanted to use the software and thus Syft Analytics was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Syft Analytics visualizes financial data across a Xero business&rsquo;s profit, customers, suppliers and cash whilst providing live ratio and variance analysis on the profit and loss statement and balance sheet. Syft&rsquo;s array of graphs and reports can be combined into a professional PDF report pack that can be commented on, downloaded or scheduled to send to stakeholders periodically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Problem we are solving
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accounting data can be difficult for most business owners to understand, extract and draw insights from. Syft enables Xero Advisors to empower their Xero business clients by automating, visualizing and simplifying monthly reporting.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SaaS pricing is an iterative process that must be repeated often.
Accountants in each country differ greatly and require a tailored marketing effort (ie. don't use Margaret Thatcher quotes in your UK marketing emails).
GDPR and our obligations in Europe.
Teaming up with complimentary add-ons can drive new user growth.
Xero's Advisor base are forward thinking and early adopters vs. traditional accountants.
Toky (VOIP software) is great for international calls.
Intercom is a great tool for drip campaigns, user support and on-boarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How is Syft different from our competitors
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In all honesty our real competitor is Excel and the reporting that Xero provides internally. People love the tried and tested, so converting them to a more tailored solution is our biggest challenge. However, in terms of other reporting add-ons in the Xero space we are by far the simplest to use. We go for a plug and play approach with simple graphs and ease-of-use rather than a long on-boarding and overly customisable tool.

Additional features like budgeting, forecasting and dashboards.
Growing our presence in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and the USA.
