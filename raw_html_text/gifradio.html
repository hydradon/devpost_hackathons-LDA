                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something cool that would allow you to find your music on Spotify in an entertaining way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GIFRadio allows you to find music solely through the use of randomly generated GIFs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built GIFRadio by creating a Node/Express back end to handle API calls for Clarifai, GIPHY, Spotify, and IBM Watson. The front end was created with HTML/CSS using JQuery/AJAX to interact with the backend APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back end team didn't have much experience with Node and generally working with asynchronous syntax. It took a lot of time to learn how to use a Promise properly, which was important when we were working with web APIs. There were also problems with executing API queries when both the front end and back end were hosted locally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to be able to learn new technology quickly in a short span of time and pick up resourceful debugging skills along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a great learning experience to work with several different web APIs. Also, it was useful to familiarize ourself with Node since it opens doors to so many other uses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GIFRadio
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to extract more meaningful features from the GIFs, automatically generate playlists for users, and expand to other content such as images, videos, or text to allow for multimodal input.
