                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While all aspects of daily life have been improving with the rise of IoT, we felt that there was an unmet need with regards to at-home security. An overwhelming number of us still use physical forms of unlocking our front doors, whether it be through keys or touch pads. Either way your security is dependent on whether someone has your keys or knows your pass code, instead of having to prove your identity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution to this problem was a hack involving Android Things, infrared sensor, and its built in camera. Ideally, movement detection by the infrared sensor alerts our module to the presence of a visitor, which it scans through its camera. The purpose of this hack was to enable the recognition and grouping of visitors into individual profiles, which the homeowner will be aware of. In addition, this hands-free solution increases ease of access and prevents the physical breach of the locking mechanism.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected the touch screen display, NXP, and camera based upon tutorials offered by Android Things. A wifi antenna and infrared sensor was later added to improve functionality. We then placed everything inside a box made in the laser-etching labs.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the lack of documentation for the Android Things platform, we had extreme difficulty debugging problems. This ultimately prevented us from using the infrared sensor and creating a full-on interface on the touch display.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This being our largest and most challenging hardware hack, we were pretty proud of how we managed to create what we had with little to none prior knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us learned the hard way of how long one can go without sleeping :'). In terms of new software, most of us have been able to experiment with Android Studios and Flask for the first time.

                    What's next for Surelocked Homes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we can look forward to incorporating Google Assistant functions, such as the ability to time a reminder to a family member returning home. Other things on the table include data analysis and smart home optimization (eg turning off lights and heating when no one is home).
