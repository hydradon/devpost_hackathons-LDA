                    Voice interfaces can be annoying to use
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voice interaction is great for asking questions or navigating to something specific.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However the experience isn't so smooth when browsing lists of information as well as in cases where "doing" is easier than "telling"
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of tasks for voice assistants can get pretty tedious so we wanted to fix that using hand gestures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    We hacked the Alexa microphone and speaker system to detect gestures using the doppler effect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa comes with two speakers. We used one of them to generate a 20khz frequency. When moving your hand around the device, we detect the changes in sound wave and map these to natural gestures to augment your voice interaction experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    To demonstrate the value of our gesture library, we created an immersive music player alexa skill.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can pause/play and skip songs with your hand. You can also flip through albums like you would at a record store but in a world of voice. This hack works on any device that has a microphone and speaker
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Now you can flip through albums, browse search results, shop items on amazon much faster and with more choices.
