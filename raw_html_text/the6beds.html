                    We identified the most vulnerable part of Toronto's Community, homeless people. When we were looking at what issues do homeless people face, we found that the service and infrastructure were not adequate. People would call in the coldest days seeking refuge and often find no information regarding where to go if the shelter of contact was full. Also the workers don't have to appropriate training due to lack of time and budget. We want to create an easy to use solution that provides them with information for the families that frequent the shelters and the homeless that are trying to scape the coldest days of the year. We try to use a decision tree and logistic algorithm to predict the closest bed available but at this time we weren't unable to find satisfying results, but we're convinced that with time we could do it. However, the present geospatial information displayed in the solution provides with TTC, family &amp; children activities information, as well as other facilities.
