                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all busy college students, wouldn't it be great if someone were to tell me what I needed to do and when I needed to do those things rather than having  to micromanage myself
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, Schedule Builder can add custom events to your Google Calendar
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Schedule builder was built in Python using the Google Calendar API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, schedule builder was going to be a chat bot that you could talk to and it would plan out your schedule for you. We ran into issues, however, when trying to set up a webhook to communicate between the chat bot and Google Calendar API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially knew nothing about API's or webhooks, and we progressed to a moderate understanding of them and were able to successfully implement both, even if the webhook did not function properly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python, git, how to work with API's and webhooks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Schedule Builder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of our challenges, we were forced to create a proof of concept in the terminal instead, but if we had more time, we would have likely implemented the chat bot or a GUI interface and created algorithms to plan out a schedule for the user.
