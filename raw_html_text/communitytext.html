                <p>
                    Many of us are stuck in our own bubble and are not exposed to how others around us tackle the challenges of life. We realized that what our generation needs is a reality check. So we developed a social media site to highlight responses of daily questions surrounding various communities revolving themes like ways people can build confidence everyday and become a better, healthier version of oneself.

                    is a web application that uses text message to find communities based on interests. Users can find other messages that they can relate to and share advice and revelations about themselves that can inspire others.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Twilio to send text messages to the user. Then we stored our data using mLab, with Google Cloud Platform as our cloud provider. We used React to display the frontend.

                    Accomplishments

                <p>
                    Our team members were able to each work on technology we were unfamilar with and learned from the very beginning. We were able to send and receive text messages using the Twilio API and submit the data into databases to depending on the community the user joins.
