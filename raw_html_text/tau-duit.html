                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tired when visiting my brother's house outside the city (Bandung), then he advised me to go to a massage parlor near the house.
It turns out that there are all blind masseurs, and my massager is the manager, he is also a blind person and all are android users. They can use smartphones for calls, messaging, listening to the radio and even making an order (gojek - grab) ride sharing application. He said his problem with current apps for read money is quite slow, have to take money picture with right potition and accuracy is no guarantee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    this apps can help blind people for read money realtime , fast and ready for some combination,
for example read several bills simultaneously and calculate the total
                </p>
                <h2>

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    develop apps that im not the user, its special for blind people.
we must make sure the apps satisfy the UX side and adjust the needs of the blind people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My apps use by blind people around the world for free (gratis)
and the model is publish for open source, for learning, research, and improvement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm interested with machine learning, because it became a new kind program software with some context. You know lah, ML can&rsquo;t replace traditional programming (developing and coding software) to become of all in one solution.
Now i try a best from machine learning to help blind people, solve theri real + ultimate problem = Read Money.
                </p>
