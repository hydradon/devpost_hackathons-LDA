                    Pokemon battle Simulator for Bitcamp 2016
                </p>
                <p>
                    This simulator allows the user to stage a battle between two pokemon, and see which one will come out victorious.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pok&eacute;mon view their lives as how many turns they have left until they faint. If a pokemon has more turns before fainting than its opponent it will go on the offensive, trying to win the battle as fast as possible; however, if a pokemon has less turns than its opponent, it uses defensive moves in an effort to gain an advantage in turns, at which point it would go on the offensive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All data for the pokemon and their movesets were pulled from an online API that stored the data as Json objects. We used C# to access that data and write our battle simulator.
