                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it easier to pay for students and adults since it is often slow to pay with cash or credit why buying school lunch and other places. In addition, it reduces the risk of fraud and the user won't need to worry about getting their credit card stolen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of going through the whole buying process, your credit card becomes a QR code and for students, there is a system for fingerprint payment. This reduces the risk of fraud and you won't need to worry about getting your credit card stolen. It also allows the user to purchase things at stores and for students, there is a money limit while adults don't have any limits. Users can also put in savings and gamble with other users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Google Site and planned out what the app would do if the user selected a certain option.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to think of ways that this app would make money. In addition, thinking of the domain name was difficult because domain.com didn't allow us to redirect the domain to google sites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to think of different options for a student user versus an adult user. We were also able to figure out how to make money with the app. We were able to create a virtual machine on Google Cloud to run Wordpress and redirect the domain we purchased to Google Cloud.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to navigate google sites and more about finance.

                <p>
                    We could use what we have so far to make it an app and have all the features we described.
