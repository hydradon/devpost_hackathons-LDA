                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A last minute run to Radio Shack

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A robot that plays the card game Rummy, specifically by using suction technology and image processing to understand the board.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A robotic arm with three motors which are controlled by a Raspberry Pi and Arduino pick up the cards, and show it to a camera which detects the type of card and sends the info to the game logic script. It decides on the best play, and then informs the robotic arm of its next move.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    The robot looks pretty badass. Our lego skills have not deteriorated since age four.

                    A long retirement in Florida. Or as a mantle on our walls; we haven't decided
