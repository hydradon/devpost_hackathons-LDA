                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "I was inspired to create a national Order of the Arrow Data base based around the use of QR Codes to store contact information for every member in the Order."- James Gutteridge
"I wanted contact Arrowmen through ONE system instead of multiple"- Anthony Jauregui
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much like Snap Codes used by most everyone today and the Spark's data base system used at the 2015 National Order of he Arrow Conference ConnectOA.com will have unique QR Code for its members to help encourage staying in contact with other members of the Order that they meet at events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we will build it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will use available website design tools to create a simple to navigate browser/application system for ConnectOA.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to create an actual website other than our sample website (QR Code in PowerPoint)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Able to create guide lines for our website idea and was also able to design a basic layout for a smartphone application.(Design in PowerPoint)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "How to work as a team."-James Guttridge
"I learned how to make a website with google sites"- Anthony Jauregui
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ConnectOA.com
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to create a prototype of the website, can create basic users and test custom QR Code Generations. Work with Games and Delivery to create add-ons such as games they design and the use of unique ways to promote our app/website.
