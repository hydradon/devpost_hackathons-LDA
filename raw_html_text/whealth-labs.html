                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In India and other developing countries, healthcare facilities aren't easily available to all, especially in rural areas. Also, in emergency cases, people from rural areas have to travel long distances and further time is needed for diagnosis after reaching the medical facility. In order to eradicate this, I have embarked to build a healthcare ecosystem that can make healthcare accessible and affordable for all.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ecosystem as of now consists of a hardware device, a patient app, and a doctor app. The hardware is portable and light. It consists of an ECG sensor that has three electrodes. The device scans the ECG signal and sends it to the patient's mobile application via Bluetooth. The mobile application receives the signal and displays it in real time. After recording, it uploads the same to the cloud structure. In the case of Internet connectivity not being there, the data can be transferred over text messages without any data loss. The data can then be viewed over the doctor app too so the doctor can conduct diagnosis remotely too.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I first went about identifying the appropriate hardware to serve the needs so as to efficiently reach my goal. After that, I coded the hardware and dumped it onto the Arduino. I then set out to build both the applications. This was achieved with the help of firebase for the backend and coded using Android Studio.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges was to connect the doctors to the patient on the backend side. I even faced issues with the Bluetooth code as well as the plotting of the ECG graph.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to successfully apply Pan Tompkins algorithm to analyze the ECG waves. I was able to prove that the data sent over text messages can still be plotted on a graph with zero data loss.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned how to build a simple but easy to use and intuitive app.

                <p>
                    I plan to take this idea forward and see this product through its ideation phase to its implementation phase.
