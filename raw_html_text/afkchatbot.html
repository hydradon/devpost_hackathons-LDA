                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to connect to Facebook Messenger and the Google Calendar API. If a user is currently in an event, the bot takes over and responds for them!

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Installing some python packages is _ somewhat _ challenging when there are conflicts between version dependencies.

                    We need to learn more flask and APIs!
