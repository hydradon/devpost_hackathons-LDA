                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Between my friends and I, when there is a task everyone wants to avoid, we play a game to decide quickly. These tasks may include, ordering pizza or calling an uber for the group. The game goes like this, whoever thinks of this game first says "shotty not" and then touches their nose. Everyone else reacts to him and touches their nose as fast as they can. The person with the slowest reaction time is chosen to do the task. I often fall short when it comes to reaction time so I had to do something about it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The module sits on top of your head, waiting to hear the phrase "shotty not." When it is recognized the finger will come down and touch your nose. You will never get caught off guard again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The finger moves via a servo and is controlled by an arduino, it is connected to a python script that recognizes voice commands offline. The finger is mounted to the hat with some 3d printed parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardware lab did not have a voice recognition module or a bluetooth module for arduino. I had to figure out how to go about implementing voice recognition and connect it to the arduino.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to model and print all the parts to create a completely finished hack to the best of my abilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to use a voice recognition library and use Pyserial to communicate to an arduino with a python program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NotMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will replace the python program with a bluetooth module to make the system more portable. This allows for real life use cases.
