                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to utilize augmented reality for a typical game that's intuitive and easy to familiarize with. It made me think about the potential that augmented reality had in the next generation of gaming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It utilizes the desktop webcam and displays the game on a specific surface, which is used for the operation of the entire game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Unity and Vuforia to build the game, along with added scripts to handle level changes and border cases that occur throughout the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had trouble trying to display the game at first, mostly because I used the wrong settings. I also ran into trouble trying to change between scenes since scripts would run simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to not only make a game that I have been dreaming of for a long time, but that I was also able to incorporate a story inside that game while using the maze game as a metaphoric setup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to incorporate basic Unity scripts into an environment that heavily uses built-in Vuforia scripts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 3D Story Maze Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to be able to add a menu, music, and a much improved UI to make the game feel more professional. I will most likely continue to work on this same game after the hackathon and hopefully, be able to make an app out of it.
