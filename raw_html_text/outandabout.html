                    We believe user generated content provides an honest and realistic view of today's world.  Everyday locations such as coffee shops, restaurants, landmarks, or hiking trails aren't always depicted honestly by the proprietors or publicized at all.  As such, we wanted to expose the reliability and beauty of user generated content in support of exploring and discovering a new or familiar area as seen through the eyes of our peers.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    OutAndAbout allows the user to explore a location of their choice and discover places of interest with the intention of planning a trip around them.  Leveraging Foursquare, OutAndAbout provides suggestions on places to eat, things do, photo opportunities, and much more.  On top of the Foursquare location layer, we display user generated images from Instagram at each of the suggested areas giving the user a realistic and un-bias perspective of the venue.  After selecting the venues they like, OutAndAbout helps plan the user route using Google Maps.
