                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept of implementing AI with Bioinformatics data.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The generated model is trained to distinguish the healthy and the diseased individuals in a set of mixed samples.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our workflow consists of 3 parts; i) Otsu thresholding for segmentation, ii) enrichment score of the window around TSS and iii) train a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for classification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Otsu thresholding for segmentation: ==&gt; It takes as an input the ChIP-seq data (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation massively parallel DNA sequencing to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins). In this step, Otsu is used to remove the background and filter out peaks by thresholding the ChIP-seq data. It finally returns the "important" regions (peaks) of the raw data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enrichment score of the window around TSS: ==&gt; In this step the input are the ChIP-seq data and peak regions that were identified in the previous step. The genes and their corresponding IDs were retrieved from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database and the previously identified peaks were annotated based on their corresponding genes and the specific window/region was extracted (data manipulation process). This step returns the enrichment score from the ChIP-seq data for each window around the TSS (Transcriptional Start Site) for each gene corresponding to the peaks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Train a Convolutional Neural Network for classification: ==&gt; The input now is the enrichment score of the fixed length sequences. This step we train the CNN with windows from 14 subjects in each class, totaling to about 20k windows in each class. After we get the trained model, we visualize the features learned by the network to determine the regions in the input that influenced the network's decision. Finally, it returns the classified probabilities for the window to lie in each phenotype.

                        In general, epigenetics is the study of the heritable changes in gene expression that does not involve changes in the DNA sequence. It causes changes in the phenotype without affecting the genotype.Our model can further be trained for specific individual's lifestyle, such as drinking alcohol, smoking and it can be useful for studies which link the specific epigenetic change with a particular (or more than one) environmental factor.
