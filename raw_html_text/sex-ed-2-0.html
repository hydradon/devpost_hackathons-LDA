                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We where inspired because we have all seen how inept schools are these days at teaching sex ed.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the U.S. only 21 states require sexual education to be taught at school, and of those only 18 require that the lessons be medically accurate. So we have built an App and a service that allows people to learn SexEd on their own in privacy.
We have the app that allows you to track and keep informed about various health issues that may apply to you.
We also have our SMS service that when you text we will answer any questions you have anonymously.
