                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People who use Momentum or who simply writes down to-do lists realize that over half of their tasks have actually been on the list for... over 2 years! Holy... We really need to do something that will help us
                    <strong>
                        get shit done
                    </strong>
                    and get on that task that's worth being dragged into a 3rd year on the list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calie is an app that generates the user's schedule through machine learning in an interactive way with our adorable chatbot,
                    <em>
                        Calie
                    </em>
                    - to understand the person's priorities and urgency to accomplish certain tasks. And with that, Calie will generate an adaptable schedule for the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...Further development of the app would involve collaborations with organizations such as Groupon or Eventbrite for example to suggest resources to help the user commit to their tasks. Ex: I need to buy boots - Calie can pull a 25% off coupon from Groupon that is expiring this weekend, better get those boots soon! I want to design my personal website - Hey! Calie found this on-campus HTML/CSS workshop happening right after 5PM class, through Eventbrite.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our young developers focused on the front end - HTML/CSS and our single back-end developer worked on the calendar with Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a team ranging from high school to 4th year university, math to accounting major, we realized we only had
                    <strong>
                        ONE
                    </strong>
                    team member who can code... So our prototype isn't fully developed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the large variety and limited knowledge of our team, we're extremely proud about working together harmoniously - and managed to generate at least part of the product. We strongly believe the idea has a lot of potential and some of us even have intentions of continuing on with the project (with more experienced coders/engineers haha)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the amazing workshops, tech talks and getting our hands dirty with our product, we definitely learned a lot more than we expected (as it was the first Hackathon for most of us). Teamwork and communication is definitely crucial - we successfully managed to get everyone on the same page throughout the 32h! Gotta step up our game for the next event! (Had a lot of fun though)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Calie
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next? I guess we'll see in terms of validation with the judges and our peers. But the idea is definitely one that we think is promising. Everything is inter-connected nowadays, and what better way to adjust your habits to boost you ahead of everyone (and your procrastinating self) through your daily activities and external resources/events.
