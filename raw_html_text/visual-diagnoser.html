                <p>
                    Diabetic Retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in adults as the eye is the first organ to be affected, with 40% to 45% of Americans being affected. This disease as well as others can be detected with a small digital camera attached to any smartphone called a digital ophthalmoscope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Existing diagnosis requires a hospital visit with an average cost of

                    for a consultation with a specialist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our solution can be used en masse provided the diagnoses has the mobile opthalmascope and a smartphone with a camera.

                <p>
                    No special medical knowledge is required to capture a photo of a patients retina and the app we built will then collect the image and then give a diagnosis together with an accuracy of the given prediction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have an app that collects an image from a

                    </a>
                    and uses a model trained on retinal images labeled with varying levels of severity of diabetic retinopathy, from non-existant to a proliferative infection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We trained a model to about 72% categorical accuracy that can recognise retina images taken under a variety of imaging conditions. We then built an app that can collect an image taken by the ophthalmoscope from the smartphones gallery and pass it to the model to provide a diagnosis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with a low accuracy of the model but through lots of iteration on the model architecture and hyperparameter tuning we were able to achieve a reasonable accuracy. Getting the converted tflite model to work also took time.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been able to create a diabetic retinopathy diagnoser that can detect the retinopathy in its early stages. Early diagnosis and early treatment will slow down its prognosis to blindness.

                    Using deep learning, we can make a huge impact on other people's lives.

                    We plan to be the Uber for preventative healthcare where we connect doctors who can offer more affordable treatment to patients with a positive diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.
