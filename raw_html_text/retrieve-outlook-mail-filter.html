                    Inspiration: SME's who doesn't have technical skills was not able to filter mails from outlook using the existing Outlook activity available in UIPath. As most of the time there source of input is Mail so they need it frequently and they were facing challenges as they don't know how to put the syntax of filters in current activity . In addition, I noticed on forums that people are facing challenges in filtering mail as lots of syntax doesn't work. So we tried to make this as Simple as we can. We have handled common input mistakes which we human are tend to make. Global Hackathon gave us opportunity to build the solution that we were planning to do for a long time.

                <p>
                    Outlook is widely used in many processes automated via UI PATH tool. One of the key challenge which the developers are facing with outlook activity is related to filtering the emails as per the business requirement. Email details can be retrieved easily using &lsquo;Get Outlook mail message&rsquo; activity within UI Path, however, using the filter property requires multiple syntaxes to be used to filter contents from an email.
We have created an email activity for UI Path where all the required options such as Body, Email Received Date, Subject etc. would be available within Filter section which can be easily used to filter emails along with the customized filter option. This will also eradicate the requirement of using syntaxes to filter emails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Benefits
Creating UI Path email activity will provide the following benefits to the business:
&bull; Effort reduction in BOT designing where identified processes requires emails to be filtered as per the business requirement.
&bull; Simplify BOT development for outlook activities, especially its beneficial for developers with no programming background.
                </p>
