                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Apples to Apples, Use your Words and other such game. We thought we could build a user friendly game using Giphy's API and Google Cloud that you can play with your friends!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Friends with Gifs is a multiplayer game that allows players to create and join a game. A creator can decide the number of rounds they will play, and other players will receive a shared code from the creator. The game provides a prompt, and players have to select the funniest gif from a set of randomly chosen gifs. Players rate each other's choices, but cannot vote for themselves. At the end of the round there is a winner, and at the end of the game we show a final winner who received the highest likes from players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was divided into two groups: front-end and back-end developers. Front-end developers started from wire-framing the game using Sketch and Zeplin, then we moved to coding the pages using HTML and Boostrap. Back-end developers worked on NodeJS, SocketIO, Giphy's API and Google Cloud Engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we struggled to even settle on an idea. For the longest time we were set on making a VR/AR experience. 3 hours of discussion led us nowhere and this idea spawned out of nowhere. We decided to go forward with it mostly because we really wanted to play this game.
We started by building the entire app using Flask but realized the need for sockets soon and had to switch everything over to a NodeJS server instead. SocketIO was new to all of us, and we really struggled with understanding it. For the longest time, we were not able to fix the issue of sockets disconnecting on redirects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of building a full-function application. We like how it looks and hope you do too! We are also quite proud of how we managed to pivot and get everything working on NodeJS after a lot of the code was already written for Flask. We learned a lot more backend - especially about sockets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using Zeplin to export from sketch Artboards. We never used SocketIO and struggled with that. Giphy's API was a first time use too, and it turned out to be a lot of fun and laughs while testing. It took a while to figure out how everything worked together, but we managed and learned a lot!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Friends with Gifs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have to continue creating a user interface to enhance user experience, making it more playful and entertaining. Minor bug fixes that will improve the user experience. We are open to feedback too! Please hit us up :)
