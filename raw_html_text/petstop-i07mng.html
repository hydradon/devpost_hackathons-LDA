                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by classic games like tamogatchi and nintendogs as well as recent games like PokemonGo and the hobby of geocaching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a community pet that you take care of at your bus stop. Objects with QR codes will be hidden around the stop. Find the objects and scan them to feed, play with, and walk the dog.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our backend is a Python Flask application that hosts a REST API and interfaces with a MongoDB local database. In the front we have some bootstrap webpages, an open source QR scanner, and google maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble coordinating frontend and backend in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working prototype, out of the box idea that would have a cool impact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about frontend because both of our developers are exclusively experienced in backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PetStop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Print more 3D models with qr codes to hide around bus stops. Talk to local shop owners about passing out our qr codes. Animate the dog and eventually implement virtual reality to be used at a bus stop.
