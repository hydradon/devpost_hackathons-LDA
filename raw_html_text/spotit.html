                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A university in England has a similar game so students can easily meet and have fun.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You log in with Facebook, and you get assigned a bounty which you have to track down. If you track him down and are in his vicinity, you have the option to "kill them" in the app and score points with this. The phones recognize themselves with the P2pkit API for Bluetooth beaming.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Android Studio and the backend is running on the IBM Blumix service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of problems with Android development... and GitHub not working. Lots of frustrations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new technologies, making the whole project in 35 hours with little to no sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot new technologies - Node.js for back end, IBM Bluemix cloud service, Android Frontend and backend development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SpotIt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will develop it for our home university and try to motivate people to play it and see if the concept is cool enough to continue on working
