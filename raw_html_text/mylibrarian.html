                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since I was a child, I've never had an easy time finding books at my library. How could one not get lost in this labyrinth of knowledge? When I want help the librarian is not always available instantly. That's why my team and I created MyLibrarian. MyLibrarian will help you find the location of your books swiftly with the press of a button.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MyLibrarian scans QR codes and loads a map of the library.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team and I spent 24hrs to implement an easy to use version of this app.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges when we wanted to use new APIs but prevailed through them at the end,
