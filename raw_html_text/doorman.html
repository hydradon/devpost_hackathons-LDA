                    DoorMan is a 21st century solution to a problem that is centuries old; it's about time they got a face-lift.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With DoorMan you wouldn't have to wait for the cable guy to be 5 hours late to his appointment and you wouldn't have to leave your keys under a garden gnome when you're unable to physically give them to someone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a world where everyone has their smartphone glued to their thigh at all times, DoorMan is a seamless right of entry to your home, and keeps you in control of who else has access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does it work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you register with DoorMan your account is paired with your door. Being the owner, you can send out and revoke temporary "keys" with just a few taps. When you come within range of a door you have access to, simply knock on it in your pocket or ask siri to "open my door" and DoorMan will instantly unlock the door.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the way to LA, we stopped to buy a door from a guy from Craigslist. He even cut it to a more reasonable size for us with his table saw! However, we left the deadbolt in his garage along with our $20. Additionally, we realized that powering servos with the raspberry pi's IO pins is a no-no and suddenly we needed a 5V power source. Ignorance and forgetfulness with hardware is a lot more expensive than with software...

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished! Come check out all that we packed on this piece of wood at the demo expo. We're really proud of what we managed to finish this weekend and want to share it with you!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first jump into hardware, so everything involving the raspberry pi, servo motors and circuits was completely new to us. It was a lot of fun and we're glad we spent the weekend here!
