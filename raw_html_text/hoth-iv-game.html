                    THE STORY:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    _We follow the adventures of our unnamed hero, Discoman, who has an uncanny resemblance to a disco ball, as it runs across the rooftops of Bassopolis, commiting horrific murders of innocent snare drums. Our unnamed hero Discoman is outrunning a barrier of desaturated colors, symbolic of the erasure of everything it holds dear--aka Electric Sunrise by Plini. _

                <p>
                    This is the introduction to a soon-to-be-never-released heartbreaking story.

                <h2>
                    HOW WE BUILT IT:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Godot to actually make the game. Used Procreate, Clip Studio Paint, Photoshop to create the art aspects/sprite design. Used "Electric Sunrise" by Plini as the backtrack. We attempted to use a vaporwave-ish aesthetic and failed almost miserably. Almost. (The color scheme is there)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having something that actually works - starting with little to no prior knowledge and actually being able to make something.
                </p>

                    WHAT WE LEARNED:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to use Godot lol basically everything, really.

                    Note: There is no executable - you need Godot to run the game.
