                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to do a game that would use non standard input (originaly with myo band and voice)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game!!! You can now be a wizard too!!! defend yourself by casting magic spell with your voice!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity3d and Nuance for voice to text
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to use Nuance which doesn't have libraries for C# / Unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the Nuance API work in Unity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Nuance API and a bit more of Unity3d
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VocaSpell
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sky's the limit! We only did the ground work. So the game can expend in every direction from now and take any shape we want.
