                <p>
                    Questions/Ideas that brings this PowerUp into Existence...
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are alot questions/ideas that came to my Mind when creating this Powers Up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.) Different People, Teams, groups, families, etc. speaks different languages, hence good communication is very necessary
for people from different works of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    what if trello can allow Users write comments on post on different langauges of their choice.
For instance an Arab guy can comment in Arabic and translate the Comment to sweedish for her sweeden fiance  to see.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An American guy can write comments in English and post it to trello in Latin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.) How can Trello Users Converts their Trello Card &amp; Comments into Rich Text Comments
(Eg. Italize, Bold, Add Colors,Images, Links etc) in the context of what you see is what you get(WYSIWYG).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will enable Trello Users to easily convert trello comments into Articles, Bloggings,Lecturing Notes etc. from and withinthe context of Trello Application..
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.)Easily Send Trello Comments over SMS to your Board and Card Members Mobile Devices
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.)Attaching Screenshots as files has become the talk of the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Question is? How can Trello Users attach a Screenshotsof any Websites, Articles, Bloggings etc. as files attachments to Trello Card from and within the comfort of Trello Application Components.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5.) Trello FaceBook:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alot of Team collaborations is happening on Facebook. Businesses, Team events, Educational Research normally occur on different FaceBook Pages.This allow Trello Users to easily attach their Facebook Page Photos and Posts directly to Trello Cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6.) Task Scheduler with Trello Comments:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay you have alot Business Clients you wants to periodically send products or adverts to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay you want to send a real-time notifications alerts to all your Board Meeting Members ahead of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Okay You have created a Birthday Event Cards and have a party to Celebrate and you dont want anybody to be left out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How can one send a real-time notifications to effect this?. How can one shedule this notifications to be triggeredin a later time.? I believe Trello has answer to this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Trello sends Email notifications to all members of the Cards regarding any updates, The app automatically schedule Trello Comments to be triggered on the selected date and time.
