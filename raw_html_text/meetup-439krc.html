                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every now and then you need to conduct meetings with a TA, project groups, professors, fellow developers, etc. A lot of people forget to block their calendar and end up missing the meeting. Additionally, you also need to share data for the meeting and minutes of the meeting. A single platform for collaboration is needed to ease the process of meetings and make sure everyone makes to the meeting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will sync with your google calendar and suggest the optimal times for a group to meet based on their schedule availability, so the people will not have to get into an argument to decide the timing for the meeting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It fetches the google calendar's events for all the people in the group and will match the common available times for the majority of people. It will then suggest these time slots to the host of these meetings, and once everyone accepts the meeting request, it will automatically block their calendars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seamlessly sync google calendar with the UI element and the logic to calculate the available time slots between the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
