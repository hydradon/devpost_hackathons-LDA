                    This project was made in collaboration with Cryptopedia, parsed API to summarize long White Pages on Cryptocurrency to help readers understand the market before investing in them. I am going to be presenting Cryptopedia and Cryptopedia with Alexa simultaneously as the two applications are interconnected.

                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just recently, BitConnect was shut down for having been involved in a Ponzi scheme. This left many people, who invested in cryptocurrency, to lose lots of money. To tackle this problem and avoid any more decisions made before being informed about the topic, we designed an application that summarized workings of this new currency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cryptopedia aims to shorten the length of papers into several sentences or paragraphs. Whilst we could insert any input of long paragraphs, our main focus was on cryptocurrency. Therefore, we wanted to "summarize" the length of White Papers, a 20 pages long paper detailing how each currency works. Shorting the papers will ensure that people make their correct decisions whether to invest or not. Rose and I wanted to take this a step further and implement this function of the application to work with Amazon's Alexa.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Web Services to build and train Amazon's Alexa skills on an Echo dot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we ran into trouble by using Coggle's Storyboard online application that creates skills based on flow-charts. However finding that this cause limitations of the code we have to call in for classes to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of and What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time we worked with Amazon's Alexa, we are proud to say that Alexa successfully recognizes the commands given on our skill app.
