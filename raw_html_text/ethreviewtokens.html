                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In my last hackathon, I worked on a decentralized EthJournal, where gas was transferred between authors/peer reviewers/users automatically. However, this did not account for the "review" a respective author/peer reviewer would receive. As a result, I built a token called the ReviewToken, which accounts for reviews, which count for credibility of the users. This token would determine the amount of ether transferred in the transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Really just playing around with Ethereum, gas, Rinkeby, Solidity. I started off looking at how to make a coin, and how the coin could be used alone and in integration with the aforementioned application.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compiling Solidity. I was using REMIX fundamentally, and most of the time, did not have reliable enough internet connection to be able to test. For a good 4-5 hours, my MetaMask extension was unable to connect to Rinkeby test network. When I finally got connected to Rinkeby, my wifi was too slow, and I couldn't connect to the faucet for Rinkeby. There was just really large inconveniences with the wifi, which significantly slowed down my development.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with Solidity again. Syntax wise, I don't think it is significantly challenging. More idea-wise. I was a lot more unsure of my process and how to do things in Solidity in my last project. This time, it was a bit smooth, as I was more easily able to look up docs (when they loaded)...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To download Solidity docs. I also learned I need to find an alternative for running Remix online, when there isn't reliable wifi. At ETHWaterloo, I read about a way to download REMIX locally, but I don't have strong enough internet to find out how to do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EthReviewTokens
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate it with the transfer of ether between authors and peer reviewers. App is also using local storage; I want to use Storj.
