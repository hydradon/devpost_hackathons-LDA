                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a platform that gave professors the ability to receive live feedback from the students as they are teaching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students are able to rate their professor's progress as they go through the course in real time. With the ability to collaboratively chat with each other and share notes. You can view past reviews from students who have taken the class with a professor as well as see the notes that they've uploaded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hosted on an Linode VPS, using nginx+php5-fpm stack, the backend DB is Clusterpoint. The framework is Laravel. Chat/collaboration functionality is provided by Moxtra.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working together as a team and only having one production server to work off of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the chat functionality working as well as being able to use the Clusterpoint DBAAS.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of cool ideas we had in mind, it was hard to pick out which features we could realistically create within the 36 hours we had. It helps to understand the general basic features that is required to get a MVP out and work from there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for KoClass
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are so many more features we have yet to add, we only wish we had more time to work on it. Study guides and tests upload ability as well as class recordings are some of the features we were looking to add.
