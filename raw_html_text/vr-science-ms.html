                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to take something that is hard to learn in 2D and that most people don't know. This lead me to creating a Mass Spectrometer tour/learning video in a mobile VR headset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teaches you in a whole new way, learning in VR is so much cooler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With lots of patients because 3D modeling and animation is a hard thing to learn. But all with 3DS-Max and Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have no artistic skills and I can barely draw in 2D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting everything to ultimately work and having an awesome demo to show
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To watch the entire tutorial video and not skip through it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VR Science MS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Another cool subject or idea that would be cool to learn in VR.
                </p>
