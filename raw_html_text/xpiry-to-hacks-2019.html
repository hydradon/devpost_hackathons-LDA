                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A social issue that we know needs to be addressed is food waste. Each year, more than half of food products are thrown away. By doing our part at home, we can eliminate household food waste, and make an impact on the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Xpiry tracks each time you buy food using Amazon Alexa and voice commands. This is done by organizing it by the name, category and expiry date. Once the food is logged, the user can go back and check the status of the food. If the food is expired the user gets a prompt and if the time is getting close the user also gets a prompt.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We based our project on Voiceflow integration with Google Sheets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first experience with Voiceflow at first so it was difficult at first. We initially were attempting this project through the use of bar codes but decided that using a smart home device would be easier for users to implement into their lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that the project runs! In the planning process we decided on milestones and we are happy to say we met each milestone. Also we are proud to have been able to practice and learn a new platform, Voiceflow.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with Voiceflow and integrate it with Google Sheets. We also learned more about excel functions. And even though we did not end up using the Java code we worked on in the beginning we were able to work with Java API's and have a bit better of an understanding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Xpiry - TO Hacks 2019
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could add more options for users, for example drinks, freezer options and implement a shelf life system so the user does not have to input the expiry date manually. Another plan to consider is to implement Xpiry using Google Assistant. We were unable to go through with that implementation because Google Assistant was only available as a Beta version.
