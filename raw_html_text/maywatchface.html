                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a pebble and wanted to see what I can do with it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tells you the time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got some help from Pebble's great tutorials
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were some problems loading new fonts
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I stuck with it to the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pebble's development environment is very friendly and easy to use.
                </p>

                    What's next for MayWatchFace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm going to program it to give snarky comments instead of the actual time.
