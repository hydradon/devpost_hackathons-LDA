                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our cousins had a gym contract with his friends and built a Microsoft excel spreadsheet in order to make sure they were going to the gym every day to keep each other accountable. With this we thought, how could we build something that could take the work off the one moderating the entire gym contract? That's when we thought of Gym Buddy.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gym Buddy is an app that keeps track of users going to the gym from Monday to Friday by acting as a check-in system where users in the group can check-in to show that they went to the gym that day. It uses colored squares to display the attendance information: Gray shows that the user did not go to the gym yet, green shows that the user went, red shows that the user missed the gym that day, and magenta shows that the user used one of their free passes to skip the gym that day.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project in android studio using Java as the base language.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we ran into was saving the information locally in the app. This proved to be more challenging than we expected and it set us back quite a lot. Another issue came with Android Studio itself. Many of us had issues running the IDE and were sometimes even unable to work in that environment on our computers for hours at a time. In addition, it was new for most of us, so it took a while to get a grasp on how it functions and how to efficiently work on the project. Outside factors also proved to be a detriment to our project as they took extra time we could have used for the project.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of the fact that our project, though unfinished, is able to run without crashing.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio is a difficult IDE to develop in, but we felt like we learned so much about it through this project and are excited to learn more in the future. We also learned a lot about group management and UX design and are excited to work more on that in the future.
                </p>

                    What's next for Workout Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement a database for all users to access information wherever they are, include a calorie counter, allow more user personalization and implement a cleaner interface for the user.
