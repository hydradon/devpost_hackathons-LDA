                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking about how most coding-learning and interview preparation websites were becoming more pricey with monthly subscriptions, and we also noticed that most coding websites are one-directional. We wanted to create an interactive application where the user can communicate directly with the chatbot to gain information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DivBot helps the user learn about programming by either quizzing the user about fundamental computer science concepts, or it provides resources for the user to learn more about programming based on their needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the structure of the chatbot in Dialogflow, and the front end in React.js. We also created a server using Express.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a challenge in deploying the final website, given the time allotted, and therefore we are submitting a video recording of the chatbot running on a local device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the interface, which looks seamless, and the fact that we were able to incorporate Dialogflow with no prior experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so much about how to use Dialogflow, and collaborate with teammates. We were struggling initially to pin down one topic for our project, but through a continuous discussion, we found something we all could enjoy and create!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DivBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to have a backend integration with a database of more coding questions, and a more dynamically interactable chatbot.
                </p>
