                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by this idea after not being able to hear one of our group members in a noisy place and thought about how people with hearing issues would experience this type of thing every day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application shows you the direction of the voice that's talking to you and shows the spoken words as text on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a three-microphone pattern that sits on top of a hat and sends the angle of where the voice was coming from to your phone, which shows direction. We also have the ability to view the speech as text on a phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges along the way. One of the biggest challenges was getting the gyroscope enabled so that we could tell in which direction the sound was coming in.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to come together and finish the project.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate hardware and software very tightly.

                <p>
                    Adding a face recognition in order to better detect when a person is talking
