                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with comparing old phones to newer phones, because of this, we notices a big difference in the accessibility of certain applications. This lead to us want to make a general accessory for most mobile devices that would allow you to control your mobile device in any way you want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ButtonBoy is a accessory that inserts a part of itself into the device's headphone jack, by doing this it allows you to have another touch sensitive touchpad that could allow you to make custom gestures to do anything possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the prototype button (Which should be a light weight touch pad but those aren't in the hardware lab), we then coded everything in C++ within Visual Studio Code and Arduino IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have the proper resources but still kept wanting to do the challenge, the bluethooth module we were going to use to directly connect a mobile device to ButtonBoy unfortunately broke out of nowhere on us, we then had to manually connect and script serial ports to combat this which did not work as the Arduino Chip we have did not meet the required specifications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a great time working together on this project, we managed to get out final Alpha protocol that has three gestures without using main connectivity ports.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot, we learned how to use electrical parts, Arduino modules, Electrical Engineering, and C++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ButtonBoy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With some more time, we can turn ButtonBoy into an actual product which will be the size of roughly 70mm if we do manage to get the correct equipment, the rest is undetermined.
