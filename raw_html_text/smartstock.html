                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Past experience losing money investing in stocks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to select and stock and interval to create a prediction for the stock
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I pulled data from quandl and created a linear regression model in scikit learn and then graphed it using matplotlib and made an interface in tkinter
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsing the data into the needed data and getting the graph to be correctly formatted in the gui
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is fully functional just a bit ugly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about machine learning and python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SmartStock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope to move on to other forms of machine learning such as nueral networks
