                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group wanted to solve the uncertainty people have when taking their medication. It&rsquo;s all too easy to forget the time medications are supposed to be taken, the exact amount to be taken, and to get prescription refilled before you&rsquo;ve already run out. We made a smartphone app, PharmAlarm capable of solving all of this. We felt this type of project fills a big need in society, especially for the elderly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the phone&rsquo;s camera, we take a picture of the prescription bottle and using Google Cloud Vision OCR, we pull the necessary text straight from the label, pulling the prescription information straight from your medication. On the app library, it then displays the dosage, limits, and directions. Then using the Twilio API, we&rsquo;re able to text the user directly to alert them when it&rsquo;s time to take the medication. The system uses the usage information to determine when a refill is needed soon. If so, the text alert is appended asking if the user would like to alert their pharmacist to refill the prescription. If so, the user can reply to the text and a confirmation is returned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using the Ionic mobile application framework, making it capable of working on both iPhone and Android. The code was written in node.js. We connected the application to Google's Could Vision platform to use the OCR to pull the text information from the pictures. The Twilio API is used to send and receive texts from the user.

                    Integrating the different APIs. Organizing the large amount data in a simple, clean way. We changed how our data was stored late in the development process.
