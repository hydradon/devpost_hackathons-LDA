                    What is it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    It is a TensorFlow graph model that can determine if a submitted image contains poison ivy or not, with up to 99.9% accuracy.

                <h1>
                    Why we were excited about making this
                </h1>
                <p>
                    As a group of freshmen, we were very unsure of what direction to go with our hack, but AI was intriguing to us.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        a lot about machine learning
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a lot about dependencies
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        and a lot about anger management
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We became very familiar with python and C#, and we learned how to use a device camera within a Unity app.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    So, what now?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We would like to finish integrating our AI within the Unity app when an updated version of the TensorFlowSharp plugin is released. After the integration, we want to publish a mobile app that people can use to identify poison ivy while in the wilderness.
