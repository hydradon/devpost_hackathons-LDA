                    Mahsool is a Blockchain-based platform connects lenders with profitable small farmers
around Egypt. Mahsool empower small farmers with increasing there access to financial resources and accses to market, connecting lenders to solvent projects. It offers a wide portfolio of investment opportunities, listed upon its risk ratings

yet excluded, and thus achieving benefits for both parts: That&rsquo;s what we call Positive Impact
Lending.
