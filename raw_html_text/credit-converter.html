                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that the information for AP class credit on college websites can sometimes be confusing and decided to find a way to simplify the information and make it easier for high school students to view this info.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The student submits the exam name, score, and college they are interested in. The information about the classes covered is displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML with CSS and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many challenges, mostly due to the fact that we were all unfamiliar with JavaScript. We had difficulties with "bridging the gap" between HTML and SQL, among others. We worked around these issues by finding other ways to accomplish our goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we completed a working product, even though it was not completely what we initially envisioned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are more familiar with JavaScript after this project.

                    What's next for Credit Converter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more data in addition to a few features, like entering in more than one exam/score at a time and including other helpful links. We could also clean up and improve the code.
