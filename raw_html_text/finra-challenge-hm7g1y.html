                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The FINRA challenge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game the tests your knowledge of finance using random multiple choice and random truth and false answers.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built it with my team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially built the c++ program so that it could be a template for when we made an app using processing, however doing that caused a lot of problems so we just decided to hand in the c++ program.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy that we were to complete our first project, although it was most of our very first time at a hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should've started the project with processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FINRA Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If it is able to be implemented using our desired processing program, we think it could end up being really cool.
