                <p>
                    For Public Information Officers and their staff, this provides a drag and drop, point and click experience for disseminating incoming, real-time community information to citizens on an hourly, daily basis. This information comes in to the government organization through many different formats and channels. This must be collated/organized and send to citizens, voters and the public at large. This is a daily challenge. The agency is doing what they can to remain accountable to city officials and the citizens, but the challenge is, getting the citizen to "come to the fountain". Citizens seem to only care about the info channels when a disaster or road closure interrupts their life, then logs complaints that their government isn't communicating with them. There is a disconnect there today.

                    For citizens, this provides a channel of information from their government, through the information channels that are already an integral part of their daily lives: Notifications to their devices, emails to their inboxes, facebook pages they collaborate in, twitter accounts they follow.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    With lots of "market" research, JavaScript API, ArcGIS Online, Feature Services,

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obtaining the data we needed to support the product vision, and nailing the requirements. Coming up with a design workflow that we all agreed on in the time allotted was challenging.

                <p>
                    The teamwork. The creativity and trust within the team.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a great demand for something that we're building. Cities have a common problem domain.
