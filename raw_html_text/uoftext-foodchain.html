                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were working on many different api's and testing whether we could work with many different platforms like Facebook and Texting and we realized that we could amalgamate all of the products together into a mapping service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our platform allows you to upload information about club events to the website, where is it then displayed. We also allow you to submit the address to your cryptocurrency wallet, so that we can send UTSUCoin, our own privately built cryptocurrrency that is continuously being mined on the AWS server. We also have functionality that can receive club information through Facebook chat and through text message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a flask server with all of the code running on a AWS server. On the server we have a script continuously mining UTSUCoin and All of the texting interface is done through stdlib.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very difficult to send the post requests through stdlib, and we had to spend many hours testing to get that functionality to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the process of working with stdlib, we encountered may bugs that were able to help out stdlib.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of time working with stdlib's texting api and learned about api's through the process of making our own on AWS through Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UofText FoodChain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally we would add more map features and a better form of moderation for the events being added.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can test out all of the functionality on our AWS server link:
