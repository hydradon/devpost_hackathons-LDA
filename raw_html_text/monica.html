                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Remember the time when you were comfy in bed, but the lights were on and you didn't feel like getting up? Well, that's what teachers ask in history class because ever since Monica, your personal assistant, you will never have to worry about this kind of struggle...again!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What Monica does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Monica employs a complex network of electronics encompassing a Particle Photon, Raspberry Pi, and voice recognition technologies to control electric devices all around in a seamless fashion. Its functions range from checking Facebook notifications to loading Spotify playlists, cooking rice to telling jokes. Monica potentially covers all household chores, letting you capitalize on that time to work on what really matters.

                <h2>
                    How it's built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A elementary layout to illustrate the circuitry would look as follows:
User talks. Microphone picks up voice. Photon sends the signal to the Raspberry Pi. Pi runs a program to convert speech to text. Pi analyses text and executes command. Pi converts text to speech. Pi sends the signal to speaker

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of now, we've spent almost a day dealing with the inadequate wifi. 
Dealing with undocumented Particle Photon was hard, mainly because of the lack in example projects and libraries. We couldn't get the Photon to output sound waves to the speaker.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Monica can communicate with Wolfram alpha.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learnt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should do further research on the hardware before deciding to use them. ie: We chose the Particle Photon for its Wifi integration, but we didn't expect it to process audio waves at a resolution (too low) that the speech-to-text program has trouble recognizing the voice.
