                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding apartments can be tough for college students. Annual leases are never ideal, prices can vary drastically in such a small area, and roommates are difficult to find. Either you can't find an apartment or the apartment you can't sublease the one you already have. We try to fix that by making housing simple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows students and landlords to post apartment availability near college campuses and find available apartments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end with React.js and the back-end with Django.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew React coming into this project, but we were excited to learn! Learning React took up a significant portion of our time, but was a hurdle we had to overcome.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning React, integrating it with Django, and learning the Docusign API.
                </p>
