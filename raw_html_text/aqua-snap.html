                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone wants to build some fancy design with gadgets. But we identified a big problem and came up with a simple solution. We feel like an app would be very effective. We studied the usage of social media in our country and came up with an idea to combined water conservation and social media. We feel like people can learn and connect better through technology and overall learn about water conservation. As a result of educating the population about water conservation techniques, we can overall conserve a colossal amount of water.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created a social media app that users can share how much water they are saving and can view others achievements. This will encourage people to save water. Users can communicate and view other people progress, and also have the ability to post their own pictures or comment on other people&rsquo;s photos for advice.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an app provided from the app store ( xCode ) we used swift to build and program our app Aqua Snap which includes various features and provides a smooth user experience for the user.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran through was that we needed to add the right content inside the app because we wanted to make our app unique.
