                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's often difficult and frustrating to plan out exactly what to do on a vacation. It's even more anger-inducing to try and budget just enough money for specific activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Breeze uses the API provided by TripAdvisor to take budget preferences and duration of stay in a city and plan out your vacation for you, making sure that you don't run out of money and still have a great time.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end is built using HTML5 and Javascript integrated with jQuery plugins. The backend is made in Java utilizing the API provided by TripAdvisor.
