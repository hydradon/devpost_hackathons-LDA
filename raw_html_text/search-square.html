                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to search through images can be a hassle. Sometimes, you just want images of a particular type given key characteristics. This is why we created Search Square. Now, with a simple search query, pictures from the imgur database that are similar in nature to the keyword given will be displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scans images on imgur checking for whether or not they are similar to the search term entered. It then displays all of these pictures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Clarifai API to tag images. Using javascript, we searched through the imgur database to find pictures that matched the tags with at least 90% accuracy or higher and displayed them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time, tiredness, and technical difficulties. We had to switch ideas midway through, and implementing the API caused some problems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to implement the Clarify API and learned how important it is to manage our time and have a good plan when approaching a software project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sreevaishnav Deevi: I didn't know anything about javascript coming into this hackathon. I was able to learn some basic syntax, and understand how javascript, html, and css are all connected together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jeffrey Meyer: I am an experienced programmer; however, it was my first hackday. I learned how hackathons were run and understood that working constantly is the key to success and finishing the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shanmukh Puttagunta: This was my first experience of how a hackathon is run. Although it was not a formal hackathon, I was introduced to atmosphere of a hackathon. I didn't know much so I acted as a designer and kept a checklist to keep us working constantly.
