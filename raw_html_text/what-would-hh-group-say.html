                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to play around with the HH groups' data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generates 10 sentences of an HH group
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parse data from csv, train a markov model from the comments and such from HH's group data and randomize which hackathon hacker group to generate the sentences
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the sentences does not make sense. The Markov model is very bad
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Played around with data. I'm happy :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not much, learned a lot from talking to sponsors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for What would HH group say?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    improving the markov chain algorithm, perhaps use nltk to better improve the grammar of the sentences generated.
