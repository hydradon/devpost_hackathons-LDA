                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The SUM-Africa project provides low-cost satellite based drought insurance services to smallholder farmers in Mali and Uganda. By teaming up with Planet Guarantee in Mali and Agriculture Reinsurance Consultants in Uganda we aim to use satellite technology to improve food security and financial inclusion in developing countries.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    USD 300 billion annually and accounting for nearly a quarter of the continent&rsquo;s GDP. Of
the millions of smallholder farmers across the continent, less than 1% has insurance
protection against agricultural risks. Insurance products geared towards smallholders
exist, but have not been able to reach scale because of three main challenges:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Affordability (cost of insurance)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Access to insurance
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Awareness (financial literacy)
Importantly, achieving the goals of building sustainable livelihoods for millions of
farmers, and implementing sustainable commercial models actually depends on
insurance products reaching scale. The main question is how we can overcome
these barriers and turn the need for protection into demand and implementation of
microinsurance protections. Blockchain technology provides new possibilities to
solve key bottlenecks.
In a high volume, low insurance premiums environment, a fully automated indexbased
insurance product is required. Through smart contracts, blockchain allows
automated translation of satellite data to the right to claim, as well as automated
and transparent execution of insurance processes such as policy issuance, claims
verification and payment. Automation also reduces the cost of insurance, improves
access to insurance products through mobile or feature phones, and offers a good
customer experience through swift payouts.
