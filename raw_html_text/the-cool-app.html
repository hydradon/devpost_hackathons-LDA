                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A while ago I noticed that Google vision api returned strange results and so we took advantage of that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If the keyword "cool" is in the array of returned strings given by Google Vision API then you're cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js with webcam and Google vision API
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    Proud that I was able to get a good portion of the app working.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Jade rather than HTML and the process of building out an app with node.js
