                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make the Internet more accessible to those who aren't able to normally use a computer with a keyboard and mouse. Now that the Internet provides so many resources, we don't want to deprive a group of people because they're technically or physically challenged.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes the users' voice commands and interprets them into computer controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected the Amazon Echo to Firebase and then connected the Firebase to Google Chrome using Watson and the Amazon voice assistant, Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Echo (and Watson) APIs were time consuming to get working. There was an uneven distribution of responsibilities in the group because everyone was at a different comfort and skill level with hacking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were finally figured out how to create new voice commands for the Amazon Echo, which was definitely a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned and familiarized ourselves with Watson, which most of us hadn't used before today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chrome Voice Assist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we can add endless commands so that Alexa has more capabilities.
