                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maintaining your health is important for many aspects of your life. If you don't take care of yourself your concentration, fitness and mental agility levels can drop. There are many existing systems with this goal in mind however they require a lot of manual data entry. We sought out to eliminate this with our implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nutrimon is a system which can be installed within your cabinet or fridge and will keep track of what you put in or take out. It is built on a mixture of traditional barcode technology and our new weight based detection system. While the logic is processed in an external server, the main interface is on your phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to build Nutrimon we split up into two smaller teams, a hardware and a software team. Which aimed to tackle their respective fields.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the problems with splitting into smaller teams was communication. Often there were moments where the two teams would have completely different ideas of what was going on. The biggest challenge which almost ruined the entire project was how long it took to find the appropriate tech for the tasks we needed to undertake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a side note, the biggest technical feat was definitely that of quite literally _ hacking _ a Bluetooth Scale into something which could be read by an Arduino and have its data processed by the Go server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On this project I learned the importance of communication and making sure that everyone is on the same page. Also, always bring a contingency plan.
