                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Non-English speaker has a hard time filling out the immigration forms, so our non-profit wanted to create a website that's similar to TurboTax where you fill out the information on the website and once you're done, a filled- PDF will be outputted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app will first prompt the user to choose the form they want to fill out. The app then will ask the user to answer questions from the form, and the questions will be shown one by one. After all the necessary questions are answered, the app will input the answers onto the form's paper format. The user, then, can download the form to be mailed to the embassy or other immigration services.
