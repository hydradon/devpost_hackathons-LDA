                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was looking for ways to incorporate technology into the creation of art.  I typically like to either remove or heighten one of the five senses.  In this case, I heightened sound.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A program takes the frequency peaks and intensities and sends that information to an arduino.  The frequency peaks are determined to be high, medium, or low, and each control a peristaltic pump.  The intensity moves the pumps in the x-direction from an origin.
                </p>
