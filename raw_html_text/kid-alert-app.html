                    As a behavior therapist, I have seen so many children exhibit dangerous behaviors that lead them to go missing.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This app will help the education team respond promptly to a dangerous situation like this by having all team members notified at the same time, and knowing exactly who has taken action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, schools do not have an efficient response to these crisis.  Administration, educators, law enforcement, emergency, and parents are all notified in a delayed manner.  This has caused physical injuries in children and staff. Devices currently used such as walkie-talkies can break, die, and have disturbed sounds. Intercoms can become busy with other incoming calls. In using the Kid Alert App, the first respondent will not have to worry about contacting authorities and team, instead they will be able to attend to the child's safety.

                    There are a lot of children who are lost or who have issues due to environmental or genetic factors tend to wander, run away, or go missing. In 2014, there were 466,949 entries in the U.S. for missing children under the age of 18 into the FBI's National Crime Information Center. There are 8 million cases reported globally.

                    The number of cases where a child with autism or a related disorder goes missing grow at an alarming rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As many as six of these children go missing each week. Many of these cases have ended in the death of the child as a result of traffic crashes, exposure to the elements and, most often, accidental drowning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over 1.5 million children had a runaway or throwaway episode in 1999.

                    Two-thirds of children are between 15 and 17 years old.

                    This apps features are sending alerts to the education team's  contact number by using sense 360 sdk, once the child has left campus. The alert will show on the phone with options to respond either with an action button or confirm button.

                    It is important to have an app that can contact people who will be your first responder.
