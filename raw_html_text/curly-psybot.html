                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It navigates and moves around according to its surrounding and its a modular robotic mouse. 
ALSO, its the cheapest one we could make in 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino Nano, Gryo scope, Motor controller (SN754410), Motors, Bluetooth module, inferred sensors, and a 9 V battery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time, Size, compatibility of the modules with one another, price, and difference in voltage of some of our components with one another. For instance, some of our components would run at 5V and others would only run at 3.3V and we had to actually make our own voltage divider using our circuit analysis knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a built mouse that can be programmed using an Arduino and it is entirely modular.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WE realized that we have an incredible ability to inhale food and not sleep yet function perfectly fine. On the other hand, we all learned a lot about electrical, mechanical, and computer science side a robotic project. We learned how to overcome obstacles and solve the issues.

                    What's next for Curly Psybot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To contribute to the human society. This was just a prototype and our first step to building a more complicated mini-robot with higher efficiency in the future.
