                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were searching for solution to helping the homeless directly. We realized that by helping connect New Yorkers to those in need, we can help people help others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to report homeless people on a map who are in need and survey whether they need clothes, food or water. This information gets stored on a map and users who are looking to help can access the locations of homeless people in need as well as what they have requested. It's like Amazon Wishlist for homeless people.
