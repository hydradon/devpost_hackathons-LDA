                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    our entire team travelled to Dubhacks from outside Washington state, and one problem we all recognized was the harsh environmental impact our trips have had on our planet. We wanted to do three things: 
1) Determine exactly what our carbon emissions were for our trip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Check to see if there was a more carbon-efficient route to our destination, even if it meant travelling by road, rail or ferry (or even a combination of the three).
                </p>
                <p>
                    3) Find out how we could offset our carbon emissions, and exactly what it took to do so.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we weren't able to add all the intended features to our product, we were able to make it do the most important thing: find the the greenest path between two locations, using google maps API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using android studio for the front end, while the backend was built using python and the google maps api, on flask, and the backend was hosted on Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was finding a way to properly display our data using a graphical interface that was informative and interactive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to design our own API to communicate with the front end of the app, using a combination of many other technologies.
                </p>

                    How to design an android application and how to write an API

                <p>
                    We'd like to finish our project and hopefully one day release it publicly on the Google Play Store.
