                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While exploring different data sets on Kaggle, we came across a peculiar data set that piqued our interest. The data revealed an odd epidemic in Swedish schools: fires. In addition to the data for number of fires per year, we found data for each Swedish municipality. Using Excel, we analyzed the data to find correlations between fires and population, income and crime rate among other things.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is an Android application designed to calculate the expected number of fires based on user input for categories such as community population and median community income if you lived in Sweden.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project using Android Studio 2.2. Along with Android Studio, Microsoft Excel and C++ were used to find correlations in the data.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge we ran into was the fact that the data was missing some entries. Along with missing entries, the data was difficult to manipulate due to the language barrier. After figuring out the correlations in the data, we had to learn how to use Android Studio. Specifically, we had to learn how to get user input and manipulate it.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One thing we are proud of is being able to create our first application. We are also proud with the overall layout and design of our application. Finally, we are proud of how user friendly our project is and the overall finished product.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This being our first hack-a-thon, we learned a lot along the way. We learned that having a plan and sticking with it is essential to the success of a project. We learned that splitting work was effective in speeding up the creation of the project. We learned how to use Android Studio to create an application. Finally, we learned the importance of teamwork in the design and implementation of our project.

                    What's next for Statistical analysis of fires in Swedish Schools?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing for our project is adding more recent data to better predict future fires as well as using more correlations to better understand the cause of these fires: past, present and future.
