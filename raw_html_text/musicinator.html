                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to create this from the emotional hardships that I had endured and the help that music was able to provide me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Musicinator plays music based on your emotion!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Musicinator with a lot of love, and apis that were not able to give me any love back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was ultimately unable to finish Musicinator due to some api keys failing to work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm proud of the fact that I was able to come up with a way to streamline emotional support.
