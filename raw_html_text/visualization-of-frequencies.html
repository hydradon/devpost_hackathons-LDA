                    At first, our team was interested on creating something hardware related so we decided to open up an arduino kit
to see what we could work with. We saw that there was a Sparkfun sound detector. We realized that the sound detector could be synced with the LEDs in our kit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created code in the arduino IDE that displays frequency from sounds onto a strip of RGB LEDs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built it using starter code from sparkfun website and then modified it to display the frequencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had trouble getting the right range for our LEDs to display the frequencies of sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were able to build a fully functioning set-up of the sound detector and LEDs using the Arduino Uno. We also built a similar set-up that detects the volume of sounds using RGB LEDs too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code in arduino and to use that code to convert frequencies and volume into a display of RGB LEDs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To add high pass frequency blocker to our setup.
