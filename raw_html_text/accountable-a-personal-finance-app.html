                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given rising student debt levels and income inequality, we wanted to create an app that will help students learn about personal finance and gain insights into their spending habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application consists of two parts: an OCR receipt scanning service and a statistics engine. Using multiple ML models, we determine the content of a receipt and a line-by-line review of purchases and assign them to a general category. Using these categories, we then perform statistical analysis of purchasing habits and provide a comparison of your spending habits to those in similar situations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our backend is built using Flask with MongoDB as the database of choice. The front-end was constructed using Nuxt.js. ML and OCR capabilities were provided by Microsoft Azure. Data was provided by the TD Da Vinci API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recognizing receipts was extremely challenging. Not only do layouts differ widely between merchants, understanding product names was also a challenge. We ended up performing image recognition on the first image search result of the product and getting a general category from that. Working with a dataset of millions of entry was also a challenge for us because we were not used to processing such loads efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully recognizing different receipt formats and deriving product categories from a product name on a receipt. Changing the color of the card to dynamically match purchasing habits like the Apple Card was also very cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about working with large datasets and building custom ML models to perform tasks.
                </p>

                    What's next for Accountable - A personal finance app
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the TD API is only meant for demo purposes, we just aim to have this as a proof-of-concept.
