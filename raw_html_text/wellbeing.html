                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal behind this project is to bring elderly people closer to this era of technology and make it easier for them to access information online while maintaining a safer environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something for elderly people. From our research we found that elderly people struggle with vision and hearing. Hence we decided to build a chrome extension with a web application specifically designed for elderly people. When the user clicks on the icon, it directs them to the web-app &ldquo;OhWell&rdquo; at the same moment the timer starts in the background which keeps track of how much time the user has spent on the website, and after certain amount of time it will alert the user to take a break. On the website there multiple resources available specifically related only to elderly people such as news, media, weather, reminder, health and connect. This will make it is easier for elder people to find information and resources which are only related to their age, hence they will not have to type or scroll in order to find information. If the user clicks on news, the news font will be automatically adjusted so that elder don&rsquo;t have problem reading as well the brightness of the screen will be adjusted automatically in the background.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extension&rsquo;s layout was designed using HTML and CSS while the behavior was added using JavaScript and jQuery. After you enable it, an icon would appear next to your search bar, you click on it and you see all your interests. Additionally, right after you click the link the timer begins keeping a record of how long have you been browsing.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first and the foremost challenge was to come up with a unique idea. Since this was our first time working with chrome extensions learning how to implement them was another challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can proudly say that we learned how to build a chrome extension and work with content scripts. In addition to that, this website diverts attention from the millennials and emphasizes on how the internet should be comprehensible to all its audience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how build a chrome extension but most importantly how to come up with a unique idea or making an existing idea unique.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OhWell
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although OhWell looks like a simple website targeted for a special age group if we are given the right opportunities we believe in turning this into a platform where the highest level of online processes would be a click away. Finally, we plan to modify our webpage to a multilingual program so it&rsquo;s attracts people from all backgrounds. Hence, making it more reachable.
