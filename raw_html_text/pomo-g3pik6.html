                <p>
                    The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that interleaves intervals of productivity with short breaks.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    pomo is small and fits inside a small (1.4oz) Pringles can (the best enclosure one could make at a hackathon). It consists of a rotation switch, a pressure switch, and LED ring on the top. The LED ring takes advantage of the programmable color and its shape to countdown time.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I bought a bunch of sensors that I thought would be cool to use right before this hackathon. I used a NodeMCU ESP8266 development board (that I have zero experience with), the Arduino IDE (that I have very little experience with), a WS2812b RGB LED ring (that I have zero experience with), and

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge I decided to take on was working by myself. As well, hacking on hardware provides its own obstacles like noisy inputs, required tools for debugging, and, of course, the pain of digging through data sheets.

                <p>
                    I was able to cross every goal off of my checklist for the hackathon :)
The list included having a functional end product that I can use when I go home!
