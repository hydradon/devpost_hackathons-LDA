                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I
                    <strong>
                        love
                    </strong>
                    cooking and
                    <strong>
                        everything food
                    </strong>
                    . However, being surrounded by college students where the majority of students don't know how to cook, want to learn how to learn, but don't necessarily have the time, I felt motivated to make a user-tailored tool that'll help college students and anyone who wants to learn the basics to get a guaranteed easy guide on cooking 101.

                <h2>
                    What it does do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My hack interacts with the user through python's raw_input and prompts the user to choose what he or she would like to do with the tool. Currently, the tool allows the user to look at the recipes already established in the database, as well as perform an advanced search of the recipes based off difficulty and meal of the day.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything is coded in python to perform all the filtering and displaying. Additionally, I'm using several text files to store the recipes and other necessary data for this hack.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I began the project thinking I'd be able to use mysql within python to access all the data I needed. However, my lack of experience in this area led me think about what it is I do know, and work on how I can make it better.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm most proud of being able to create a working prototype of my idea. This has reaffirmed to myself that attaining my goal is very much possible. All I have to do is be willing to put in the effort to create it.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While I'm super proud that I made a prototype of my idea, I've realized that I'm no where near where I want to go. For one, I know my code isn't efficient enough that be able to support what I will need in the future. Additionally, the user interface through python is incredibly bland and I will need to create a website to better control the aesthetic of the tool.

                <p>
                    I want to be able to further develop this hack, as it is a long-term goal of mine to launch a website dedicated to meal plan generation to make it easier for people to figure out what to eat, and have a platform that'll allow anyone and everyone to customize their cooking to their preferences.
