                <p>
                    Family members can add their events and it'll help them organize events and effectively communicate their important events to each other.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using python, datetime, tkinter, django, and sqlite3.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges of getting the database to relay back our information as well as building an interactive calendar. We also initially had 5 people and then dropped down to 3, which hurt how much we could reasonably do. We also decided to use python, which we're learning in class.
