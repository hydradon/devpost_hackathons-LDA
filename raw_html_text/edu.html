                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to make this by the idea of credit system used by banks and felt like there should be a similar sore to measure qualification and capability of a person for the purpose of employment and education.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It targets different elements of your life like age,grades,skills acquired,attendance and extra curricular participation.
Then there are sub sections to these areas but together each of the 5 main area holds an equal value of 1 max and after evaluating all the areas it returns the combined EDU+ score for the individual.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using c++ by separating each element into a different variable model and creating scales and calculations to obtain the max and min value for each to finally obtain the EDU+ score.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a lot of challenges at start like figuring out how to value what area and overall how to distribute points on basis of importance was tough, after that the general debugging errors and then lastly i had some issues with my compiler which forced me to modify my code to finally obtain the desired output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I feel proud that i was able to hack this together and also come up with this idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to create basic artificial intelligence models that helped me direct the score for my program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EDU +
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next version will have a proper python machine learning back end that with create much more accurate and efficient results and also include more areas to grade and evaluate.
