                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to increase the life of the speakers by estimating the health of the drivers and Hardware.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application checks the quality of your Bose SoundTouch Speaker by comparing audio files with existing database and checks the quality of the speaker drivers.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript for the Web-Application[Front End].
We used Python with existing API's[One-DB, Bose SoundTouch API] and have Arduino and Bose SoundTouch for Hardware interfacing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using API's for the first time was a bit challenging.
Implementing multiple API's at the same time appeared to be a roadblock at first, but we got through it. 
Using flask as localhost was something we had never experienced before, and it was intriguing to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to put together the project in a clear and concise manner, with our ideas in place and we think we accomplished our small and humble goals for this project successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that apart from coding efficiently, team-work,time-management and seamless communication between group members is of utmost importance. We also learned how to use API's, Flask and deploy web-apps, along with One-DB's cloud based Authentication services. I believe we all learned more due to the bonding we had at BostonHacks  and we believe that small goals are the key to satisfying results.
                </p>

                    What's next for TruPhase
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to take this to another level and make it big by implementing numerous API's and making the world a safer space for our beloved Bose speakers.
