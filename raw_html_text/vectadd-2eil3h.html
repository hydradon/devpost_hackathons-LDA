                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is difficult to type in all the separate functions to add vectors in math class so this function saves a heck of a lot of time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the bearing and magnitudes of two vectors, information on the sum of the vectors is given
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the mathematical functions required to add vectors together manually, we made a combined method to save time
                </p>
