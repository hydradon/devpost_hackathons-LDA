                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having been blessed enough to be born in the United States, my sister and I were able to really foster our love for education, and learn to never take any opportunities that appear for granted. Coming from a family and society that places a value on race, gender, and religion we have come face to face with many prejudices. Some may even call us the ultimate minority, when in reality, we're just your average African-American, female, muslims trying to make in the world. At a very young age we were well aware of the  crafted challenges and barriers that were awaiting our arrival, but not until my sister mentioned how she had discovered a love for technology did we realize how rough life would be. At the very beginning of her technology based adventures, discouraged by many, the concept of binary code was brought to light and sadly had begun to discourage her and her fellow peers. In an effort to combat this negative connotation associated with binary code, we have constructed this friendly gaming app. Alongside our friend Eliana, who is also grateful to be in the U.S. now, we were able to construct this app to encourage students of all types and backgrounds to code and that females are in fact strong and intelligent beings. Let us return to our roots and empower more females to move forward with us. Theres power in numbers.

                <p>
                    Binary Bots is a game to teach the fundamental aspects of coding. It teaches the person the numerical base of two as opposed to the base ten system we are familiar with in our everyday lives. The application of Binary Bots helps to simplify the technology we use.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the implementation of eclipse and google sketch we were able to create the skeletal structure of the program, and program the game more effectively in design and theory.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into was attempting to link the arduino board to the eclipse program used to write our code. We worked on this problem a long time before deciding to move on with the base of our program and create the game with a possibility of utilizing the additional features. Our lack of knowledge on the integration of both programs, and programming over all did cause some set backs but as jpmorgan said so eloquently "

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our commitment and teamwork. Although two of us are not very experienced with programming, we were able to collaborate and come up with the idea of Binary Bots. While two of us worked on the design, presentation, and inspiration, Suad worked on the programming. *Along with our ability to pick up a lot of new info on arduinos.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it was our first time at a hackathon, we learned a lot about the hacking community and how programming works. We also learned the real world applications and the endless possibilities hacking brings. Programming needs to be more accessible to the community and easier to understand so that everyone can have a chance to learn to code. We learned that we no matter what gender or any aspects we identify with, we can achieve anything if we put our minds to it, and work together.

                    What's next for Binary Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to make Binary Bot more interactive with the additional feature of arduino with lights and sounds to communicate with the player.
