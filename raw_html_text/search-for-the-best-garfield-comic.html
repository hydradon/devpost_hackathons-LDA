                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We take all the Garfield newspaper comic strips from 1985 and split them each into their 3 component panels. Then they're randomly stitched together into new strips which people can vote on. The votes are taken into account and only the good panels show up in the future, tending towards the Best Garfield Comic!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the client using react, with the server side and hosting handled by firebase.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever used react, and most of us had never done

                        any

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!
The comic panels are completely swapped out with new panels without refreshing, and over time the randomness converges on the public consensus of the 'Best' comic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a crash course in react, how much a pain firebase databases can be if we're not prepared, and setting up a webserver from scratch!
                </p>

                    What's next for Search for the Best Garfield Comic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a fun project for the 3 of us to learn about web development and how everything works together, however this is likely as far as it goes.
