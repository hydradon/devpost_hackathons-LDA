                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help our colleagues to find information wherever they are by voice command.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Lets us trigger searches by voice command with a custom trained hot word.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Raspberry-pi device on which we installed and configured google assistant sdk.
                    <br>
                    We changed the "Ok Google" hot word, with help from many of our colleagues by training it to answer to "Hey Zitec" using Snowboy.
                    <br>
                    Using a specific function, a PHP is called in command line that makes it possible for us to add events to the Microsoft calendar

                    Even though at 8 PM we had to delete and restart from scratch we are proud that not for a minute did we think of quitting.
                    <br>
                    We are also grateful to the colleagues that helped us pull through when we were in a jam.
                    <br>
                    We are proud that we managed to use 4 technologies that are new to us and that we learn during the ZiHack
