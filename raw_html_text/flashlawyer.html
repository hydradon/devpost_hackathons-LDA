                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are tons of legal document generators on the web (FormSwift, LawDepot, etc.), but they all rely on big clunky multi-step HTML forms. What if a chatbot could replace forms, validation errors, text search, help pages, tooltips, modals, and hyperlinks?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My vision is a legal document builder that feels like speaking to a human lawyer.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The bot starts by determining the legal document required by the user. For example, a user might say "Selling my boat", then the bot pull up the Boat Bill of Sale template.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It will then initiate a series of questions to fill out the main variables/slots in the form, such as "What is the Boat Make and Model?""
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When complete, the bot will automatically save the document, then email or download it at the user's request.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                        Making Lex accept general input. Most legal document data is not iterable, so it's been hard to build a model that will catch all utterances.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrating the TypeScript AWS SDK with Angular.

                        Keeping Lex synced with the application state.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of developing an app that is asynchronous, serverless, and that uses NLP features. This is perhaps the first open source example of a Lex chatbot on Angular and just scratches the surface of future possibilities in web development.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned a ton about Lex and how to use NLP to enhance the user experience. I also learned that lambda makes it easy to build specialized services across different platforms and languages.
