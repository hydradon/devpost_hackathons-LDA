                    Business has become more about pictures than words, perhaps because &ldquo;a single picture is worth a thousand words. Successful businesses utilize their images in the most effective manner possible; mostly due to the fact that they have a well-funded graphics team at their disposal. Thousands of small businesses suffer and don&rsquo;t grow without these vital resources. At the same time, interestingly, graphic design has emerged as a truly legitimate career for aspiring artists or even just as a small side-gig. Our app, stART-up, meets the needs of both of these groups by giving each a head-stART in their careers. Freelance graphic artists can find opportunities to showcase their graphic design abilities and start-up companies can find high-quality designs to give their companies a competitive edge. Now, the rest of my team will go into the specifics of the functionality of our app.
