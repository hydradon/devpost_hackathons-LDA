                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The H&uuml;b concept is inspired by the technological advancements that make it possible to imagine future Helsinki (in 5 - 10 years) without any designated bus stops, and instead of normal buses, there could be autonomous buses or something else. The design is inspired by the Finnish landscape of lush forests and the increasing importance of sustainable consumption.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    H&uuml;bs are new age service points for urban commuters. It provides personalized travel and leisure information to the users in an intuitive interface. It also makes sure that the commuters feel comfortable while waiting for the transportation. The curved touch screen display utilizes the optimal space to provide the best possible experience for the user. The sensors (weather, proximity) placed will enable the H&uuml;b to protect the commuters from poor weather conditions. The roof will automatically extend when the weather sensors detect rain or snow. The roof is intelligent enough to extend automatically and cover more people if needed.The retractable seating system optimises space usage, also allowing the passengers to use seats as desks. The H&uuml;bs are self-sustainable with solar power and allow commuters to charge their electronic devices (possibly not feasible during the winter). In addition, the plant communicates sustainability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The digital touch screen interface also promotes social interaction as users in different H&uuml;b locations are able to see and communicate with each other. The interface will also give users recommendations based on ongoing events, location, and real time weather forecasts. The integration of HSL route planning system ensures that commuters don&rsquo;t get lost. The personalization aspect of H&uuml;b enable external advertising partners to customize adverts according to the user preference and interests.

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As our team did not consist of any developers, we relied strongly on our product and service design abilities. Approaching the problems from a user perspective enabled us to develop a futuristic bus stop that provides practical benefits. We started the design process by identifying all the possible challenges that a person may face at a typical Finnish bus stop. We categorized all those challenges into different areas and identified the touch points. We also listed out all the associated stakeholders in order to have a different perspective to the problem in hand. As the next step, we defined the problem statement and brainstormed solutions to tackle it. We shortlisted, combined ideas and generated the final concept. Drawings and journey maps of the final concept were made before 3D modeling the H&uuml;b and prototyping the digital user interface.

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a coder/ developer.
Selecting a track based on our skills and interests.
Finding a place to work.
The main challenge was to decide how to showcase our concept without a coded, working prototype.
