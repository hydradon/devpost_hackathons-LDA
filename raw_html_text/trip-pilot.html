                    Fabian and I both traveled a lot during the last 2 years and noticed there's no complete solution when it comes to organising your trips. Manual solutions, like collecting everything within Evernote, do the job but are really cumbersome to use when traveling and carrying all your luggage around. Trip Pilot makes this easier by giving you a clean and dynamic overview of your trip and additionally even reminds you where to go next. For example when getting of a plane, Trip Pilot would send you a notification telling you which subway to take to get to the city.
