                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed a fast way to scan people's tickets and get them into the club so they can start spending money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rapidly scans QR codes that users receive in their emails as tickets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were trying to use reactnative but it was literally impossible to get the QR code scanner to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to send the QR code data into a php file on our web server that checks wether or not the ticket is valid, if the ticket is valid it then registers the user into the event. If the ticket has already been scanned it will let them know that the ticket has already been scanned and is no longer valid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    reactnative is easy if you're using its built in components but it doesn't play nice with custom components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Team Underground QR Code Scanner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Login page for the app, list of events, list of customers inside each event, graphical data of net sales for each event. Hopefully move the app into the reactnative framework.
