                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking of different aspects of our lives that could be improved. We thought it'd be amazing if people could talk in different languages but be able to communicate without any obstacles or delays in understanding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a messaging tool where you can specify a language and you'll be sending and receiving in that specific language only.
When you send a message, we translate it into the receiver's preferred language automatically, and the receiver can send a message back with whatever language preferred.
The basic idea is that you can talk and receive messages with anyone around the world in the language you feel most comfortable with, without having to worry about translating and copying the text over every time.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote mainly in Java and created a windows application. We implemented and designed the format and brought in the Google Translator API.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've decided to use the Google Translator API. 
But it was hard to implement the API in to our code and correctly use to translate the texts instantly.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of all our accomplishments for this project. From designing the messenger, making it as easy and efficient for people to use, and instant translation of language to seem as if we are all talking in one language.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create and operate a windows application and work with the Google translator API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next step would be to take care of more finer details of the app. We would need to edit and add the different languages available, number of chats, and etc. Also, this could easily be developed into a mobile app or other media according to the needs.
