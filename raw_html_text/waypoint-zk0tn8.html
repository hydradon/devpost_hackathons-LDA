                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTC Vive's 3D drawing app and Yelp's hidden Monocle feature gave us the idea of a social environment platform based on sharing a communal environment as opposed to a communal set of "friends" or "followers"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core functionality of WayPoint is the creation of tags that are tied to a location, with a message, and disappear in 24 hours. The tags are viewable through either the AR interface, or through a traditional list view.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end is built on the iOS platform with Xcode and Swift. It utilizes the open-source HDAugmentedReality SDK for the AR interface.
The back-end is build with the Bottle HTTP framework for Python, and hosted on the cloud through Digitalocean.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be honest, the AR SDK left a lot to be desired in terms of location accuracy and consistency, though it is fairly consistent at medium-to-long range. We deferred AWS or FireBase in favor of a barebones backend system for speed of deployment, and of course that came with its own unique set of challenges, such as persistence of data, as well as interfacing between client-side and server-side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though our project is less than 48 hours old, we are proud of the already relatively refined and intuitive UI. The backend is extremely minimalistic and does everything we need and nothing we don't need, with the ability to implement new features. We are both relatively new to hackathons and this is our first time demoing a project. Simply put, we are proud of following through on a decently complex idea from concept to execution; and over a weekend, no less.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The iOS workshops and mentors were instrumental in helping us make our first app (especially Russell!) We learned more about what goes on under the hood of iOS apps, which gave us a better intuition when looking for the "right" way to implement a feature or fix a bug. Michael had never worked with iOS development or Swift before, and George had extremely limited knowledge in HTTP. Now we each have begun to acquire a working knowledge of both.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WayPoint
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, we want the AR functionality to work in a way that is more conducive to our ultimate vision of the app. Either by finding a new SDK, expanding on the current one, or writing our own from scratch, we want to
                    <em>
                        dramatically
                    </em>
                    improve the stability and accuracy of tags and also add features such as orientation in three dimensions and possibly placement of other 3D assets.
One feature we wanted to implement from the beginning was for tags to only last 24 hours, but also giving other users to "like" tags and increase their lifespan by an additional 24 hours per like.
One cool idea would be to use your iPhone as a paintbrush and paint in 3D, and have your work available for other users to see.
And then, of course, there's HoloLens integration. :)
We are very excited to continue development of this app and grow as hackers!
