                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know people in our lives who have suffered from depression and trauma. They are people that we need to be more sensitive around and the internet is filled with triggering content that may harm them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The filter skims through all websites accessed by the user and removes any potential trigger words to prevent any harm. The entire sentence around it is also removed in case it contains a context that is dangerous for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program was built in python and a website built with HTML &amp; CSS was created along with it to explain its function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the issue of not being able to do exactly what we initially planned. We originally wanted to create a chrome extension popup but we realised that would take up too much of our time and we wouldn't be able to complete it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we created an actual program that works and that we managed to bring this idea to fruition quite quickly.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about online platforms.

                    What's next for The Prevention Filter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step is to turn this project into a user-friendly chrome extension.
