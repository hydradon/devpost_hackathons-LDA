                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are always small tasks that can't be completed due to the limited hours in a day. Tasks that are of lower priority are continuously pushed back and as such stock pilled. When tasks such as they can be handed off to others for completion a whole market is opened to those who have the availability to do such tasks. Given that said tasks will be simplistic there is no need for specialized certification. This create a software as a service platform to which we can market based on the needs of jobs that a person needs to get done and is willing to pay for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It finds local "odd jobs" in the area based on your location. It categorizes these tasks into divisions so that it can be easily sorted and parsed. From there a user is able to post a new task with set identifiers or accept a posting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Anjularjs and javascript we set up the the MVP to show of the key features of the app. Currently our information is stored locally through javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the webpage to interact with a database. When trying to integrate angular firebase we had problems trying to connect to the data to simulate profile and job allocation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It fulfills all the requirements we set for the MVP. It is able to show tasks, accept tasks, create tasks, and give visual representation of map simulation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application would have been better as a mobile application to better handle the notification aspect that we originally envisioned.
                </p>

                    What's next for Vulcan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continuing the idea for our senior project and potential business idea. If we also able to better work out the aesthetics then the application functionality will be great.
