                    Dj-Husky is a web-app designed to make your parties even more interactve. By creating a Party instance, you can host a Spotify playlist online that your friends can access. Songs are ordered and played based on the upvote/downvote ratio (you and your friends upvote and downvote songs). Furthermore, anyone can search and add songs to the playlist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now, we are able to fetch the data in the database display that information on our web page. You can search for songs and add them into the Party. So far, connecting our app to the Spotify native app is not supported functionality, and neither is song voting.

                    This was all of our first time working with Javascript, the Django REST Framework, and the first real exposure to HTML and CSS for most of us. We threw ourselves into a completely unknown environment, and are proud of the work we were able to accomplish in 24 hours. Though we were faced with ridiculous bugs that consumed an embarrassing amount of our time, we gave it our all, and we had fun. Thank you HuskyHacks 2016, we'll see you next year.
