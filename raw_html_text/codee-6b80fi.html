                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In January 2018, 8,711 children in New York City are in foster homes, 80% of which have significant mental health issues. Foster kids usually face more obstacles than other children through the loss of their parents, and with that comes a lack of support that a child would need. We thought it would be best to create an app that would be a companion capable of giving them access to resources they need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is a chat bot that not only provides a dialogue to foster children, but also provides access to necessary resources, as well as gathers and analyzes real-time data for social workers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the user interface of the application using React Native, then integrated IBM Watson Assistant to allow for a dialogue between the user and Codee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty using React Native with Expo to initially make the app, since using Expo would not allow for the integration of IBM Watson APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create an  application that has the potential to provide foster children with aid that they might not have access to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create applications through React Native and APIs, as well as implementing data pulled from NYC Open Data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Codee
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to further develop Codee to be more user-friendly by implementing IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer.
