                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a simple and free web app that can help groups easily take attendance in such a way that allows them to get meaningful data in return.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presents is a attendance tracking web app that runs on a many to many relational database. This allows for attendance but also basic membership and event tracking for normal club activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Presents in the ASP.net Core Framework and wrote it in C# and razor. Being familiar with SQL databases and the MVC model allowed us to design a simpler app that still solved a problem in our community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially when we came to Dubhacks we had a totally different idea of what our project was going to be. Our first idea was to work on an app to help combat phishing scams that often prey on less technical people. This app was inspired by my parents who often ask me to check emails for them to make sure they are legitimate. While we thought this was a solid idea for our project it turned out to be more complicated then we had first imagined. We reached a point where we decided that our idea just wasn't plausible for our first hackathon and decided to scrap the idea (for now). With almost 12 hours spent on the first idea, we were left with less than half of the competition to come up with another project idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a lot of progress in our first app and we do intent to pursue the completion of it whether that be at another hackathon or just for fun. While we put a lot of work into our first app, we are most proud of the fact that we were able to complete Presents in the limited amount of time we had left. This was a big moment for our team, especially because this was the first hackathon for each of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest lessons we learned is that sometimes the scope of an idea is just too big to finish in 24 hours. On the other hand, we also learned to never give up and to always do our best even when faced with difficult setbacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Presents
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While Presents was functional by the end of this hackathon, there is still plenty of room for improvements and expansions. Both the Member and Event databases could be expanded with more fields of relevant data and there are plenty of improvements that could be made to the UI. All in all Presents was a awesome first time hack and it taught us a ton of new things that will prepare us for our futures in Computer Science.
