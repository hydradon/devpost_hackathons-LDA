                    Alto is a community-driven, crowdsourced parking app that lets people know about parking restrictions in their city. It is powered by the people in a community to minimize parking issues in neighborhoods. When people find it easy to learn about parking restrictions in an area, they will feel motivated to contribute to their own locality.
