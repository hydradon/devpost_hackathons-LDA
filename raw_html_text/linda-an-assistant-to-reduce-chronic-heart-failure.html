 One of the hardest things was choosing an initial direction for our project using the most solid and realiable scientific information available. It was a humbling experience but also an inspiring one: we understood that to accomplish something we had to start from the big picture, study and work hard to reach a specific issue that people absolutely needed to be solved. We are proud of this journey.
