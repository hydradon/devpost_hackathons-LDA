                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I took inspiration from BrainFucks(pardon the crude name, I didn't make it) simplicity and a slight interest in genetic simulation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simulates 100 agents who have the ability to self modify their own genome as they please, with incentives of not dying if they build towards complexity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it from creating a Brainfuck interpreter and creating permutation/mutation algorithms. forcing the units to operate off of a limited genome and adapt or die.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front-end was the most difficult by far, I would've gone so much farther if I had assistance in it since I'm not familiar with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very few people have made programs that can write themselves, at least none that I've met.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that front end development and sorting algorithms for multidimensional arrays are harder than they look.
                </p>

                    What's next for EvolutionF
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More patches for the front end most definitely. also will include templates for the agents to read and even code themselves from, while creating permanent memory for them so that they keep their knowledge in between bootups.
