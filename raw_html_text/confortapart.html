                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were taking a look at availables open datas in Montreal City and we noticed that there was some datas about bed bugs signalisation. then we wanted to use those datas to help improve Montreal city, making it a much smarter city et having a positive impact on people life quality.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Goal is to  help people choose the best area for them to live by associating each area with a score based on bugs presence in near appartements, air quality, hospitals nearby, publics parcs, schools and any crieteria that can help people choose the best place for them.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a website using Google Cloud Services combined with Javascript, HTML and CSS.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not being familiar to the technologies we have used was a good challenge for us and none of us has sufficient experience so it tooked some time to start but we've finally make a good project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of dividing the map city into many littles square and using them as area to perform our analysis and to generate scores for areas. We were surprised and really proud of the result on the map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this we have learned to easily work as team with people even if it is the first you've met them. It was really a great experience to take a new technology and to work with it to get that result on 24 hours.

                <p>
                    We really think it's a great idea that can be developed more with a good business and marketing plan. It will have effevtive and immediate impact on citizens. We truly believe we can get something more elaborated from this idea.
