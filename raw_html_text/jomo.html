                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Transloc every day can get frustrating. Zooming on the screen, having to navigate through a map, tapping on a tiny icon repeatedly just to find out where the bus is? It shouldn't be so hard. That's why I created JOMO.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply put, you will be asked to choose a single bus, which will immediately take you to a page with a list of stops near you on that bus' route, sorted by distance, and the next three arrival times of the specified bus. Tapping on the stop, will take you to a page with all of the buses that come to that stop, and their next three arrival times. Of course, you can always go back to the first page and repeat the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Transloc's OpenAPI, I was able to get all the necessary information about Duke's Transportation System. I integrated this with Google's distance matrix service in order to filter my results to get the stops closest to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working alone was a greater challenge than I expected it to be. Looking back, I realize that I underestimated the amount of work that would have to be put in this app to make it work. Also, my lack of experience proved to be an issue as I ended up living on stackoverflow.com scouring for any sign of help. I had never made an app before, and never worked with any API until today, and that definitely ate up a lot of my time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to build my first ever app by myself. Being able to do so within 24 hours. Not falling asleep on multiple occasions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These past 24 hours provided a huge learning experience for me. Having to do everything under a time pressure with no help forced me to learn a lot of things, quickly. More importantly, my confidence in this field has risen dramatically, and I had fun doing this.
