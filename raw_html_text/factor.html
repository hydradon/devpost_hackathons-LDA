                    This is Factor!
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Factor lets you put your money where your mouth is. It rates companies on their ethical practices based on your own values. You can also get an ethics score based on your transaction history by linking a bank account or Venmo.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever felt guilty for not researching the companies that you buy from? Do you know the implications of patronizing, say, Amazon -- from an ethical standpoint?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Factor aims to solve this dilemma. In our interconnected society, we rely on an overwhelming number of brands, which in turn produces an overwhelming amount of research in order to be a conscious consumer. That's where we come in.

                    What it Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Factor has a few features: 
1) set up your ethical priorities upon creating an account (eg. racial diversity, environmental impact, wages, etc)
2) allows you to search a company and see its ESG score, information about its practices, its presence in the news currently, etc.
3) has a news feed of companies you follow and topics you care about, set up in your preferences when you create an account (eg. "Company gender issues in the news today...")
4) uses your transaction history to compute a score for you, based on whether you're following your own ethical values in your purchases

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python we scraped Yahoo finance for ESG scores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code a prototype of some of the website's pages.
