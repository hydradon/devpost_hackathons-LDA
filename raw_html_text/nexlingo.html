                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was working on a previous language learning app but it uses some HTML5 APIs which are highly dependent on the user's platform. It doesn't work on mobile devices, so voice recognition is non-existent. Since Nexmo is platform agnostic - voice and data is present on even the dumbest of phones - I thought of combining Nexmo's Voice and SMS APIs for language learning on the go. If your resolution is to learn a new language this new year, nexLingo will make it easy for you to do so, even without data connectivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The premise for nexLingo hinges on the hypothesis that if a machine-driven speech recognition engine can recognize what you are saying, then a native speaker would understand you without a problem. To yourself, you might think you are pronouncing words correctly, but to others, it might sound like you are spouting gibberish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    nexLingo allows you to learn a language effectively by checking your pronunciation anytime, without a data plan since it entirely depends on texts and minutes, which are mostly unlimited in the US.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a fun aside, if you are feeling lonely, there is a chatbot component in nexLingo that allows you to converse with a machine. For now, it supports English, but with a bit of integration with CMU Sphinx and a basic machine learning model, one can extend it to other languages easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend is in mainly Python with a smattering of PHP since Nexmo doesn't like Flask-generated VXML documents.
Integrated it with Google's Web Speech API and CleverBot API.

                <p>
                    Need something to talk to? Dial +1 234 650 7123 and our chatbot will lend a listening ear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to check your pronunciation on the go, first send a text message to +1 234 650 7110 in the format
                    <strong>
                        LANGUAGE english/chinese/french/spanish/german
                    </strong>
                    . For example, sending
                    <strong>
                        LANGUAGE chinese
                    </strong>
                    will tell our servers that you want to check your Mandarin pronunciation. You will receive a confirmation text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, give us a ring any time at the same number, that is, +1 234 650 7110, and speak away!
