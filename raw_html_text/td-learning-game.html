                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Unity engine-based Tower Defense Game with the aim of being able to entertain and educate young kids who are 'Complex Care' patients, as defined by Children's Health Hospital. Our hearts broke reading about the complicated processes involved with complex care patients, and we  figured that not only are these kids probably bored, but they are also falling behind on school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an engaging tower defense game with a UX of a mindless tapping form. Kids will have to answer questions correctly in order to obtain cannons and defense towers to stop the enemies from reaching their base.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew Unity or game dev at all beforehand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned and are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to effectively split up work and merge together when using Git with Unity and various aspects of game control engines.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A dynamic question database and an actual deploy-able application.
