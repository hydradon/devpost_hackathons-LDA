                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is to create a wireless sensor network without requiring a central server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TinyStore synchronizes log entries via the raft consensus algorithm. It is fail safe for (n-1)/2 units and supports plug and play with a minimum of configuration. It's also possible to run TinyStore on good old standard computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am using platformio to program the microcontroller but using the same code (except for a few ifdefs and the platform specific UDP provider) also on normal PCs ans Macs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part was to debug the communication between the devices over UDP messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most parts of the raft algorithm are implemented for microcontrollers as well as standard computers and they are able to communicate with each other
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication between different kinds of devices over UDP is a pain to debug. But tools like wireshark can help a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TinyStore
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would be to build a real storage service on top of the current implementation, because at the moment it's only possible for the leader of the cluster to commit hard-coded log entries.
