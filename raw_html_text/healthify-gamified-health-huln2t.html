                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To successfully persuade anyone to do anything you have to motivate them do it and make it easy for them to do it.[1] Many habit tracking apps have existed for some time now, however the market has failed to see a dominant player come to power, and is extremely fragmented.
Ultimately, the market has failed to provide an effective solution. We believe one of the main reasons for this is that all these apps rely on the user to manually fill in their progress. In the best case, adding friction to the process of habit forming is counter intuitive; in the worst case, people lie about their achievements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app uses APIs to collect relevant data from the source (CapitalOne Nessie Hackathon API), unlocking a level of precision no other app can match, whilst providing a seamless user experience so they can get on with what they do best. Forming habits is hard, and we&rsquo;ve gamified the process to deal with this problem once and for all. We&rsquo;ve introduced social incentives in a big way, with account leveling, titles milestone rewards, and badges, and it&rsquo;s easier than ever to compete with others with our global and local leaderboards. If users fail to meet the goals they&rsquo;ve set, we&rsquo;ll donate some of their money to a charity of their choice, based on the rate they&rsquo;ve defined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example:
We use financial data (transaction history, have they been to a pub?) to determine whether the user is following their goals for a set period of time (recurring). If the user ends up going to a pub, this will lead to a penalty but if the user continues to follow their goals then they won't be penalised and they will get their money back. But if they don't, then their money will be donated to charity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using React and Node.js for the front-end and the back-end and deployed and GraphQL/Postgres for the database. It is deployed to the interwebz using Heroku and uses CapitalOne API to obtain financial data and Fitbit API to obtain health data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing the algorithms to check whether the user is compliant (whether the user is following their goals) took ages.
Not everyone in the team knows Node.js and react.js, so there was some difficulty working with it.
                </p>

                    Our team-bonding experience, commitment and hard-work under pressure.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Agree on a more easy-to-use programming language which is perfect for Hackathons.

                <p>
                    Make leaderboards for users
Possibly provide option to store money in Monzo Pots, so that users can invest their money if they fail their goals.
