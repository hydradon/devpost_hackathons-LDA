                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    One time not so long ago, ok about 14 years you caught me, i had just got out of the army. being stationed in alaska I had what could be described as a very long journey to get back home to michigan. Well during that nasty road trip, it was winter, I got to thiniking why is there no way to figure out how much this would have cost? We would have saved a ton of headaches if we had known how much money we needed to get home. So fast forwards 14 years and here you have a Almost working prototype of Tipboy.

                    By typing a bunch of charcters into my computer and hoping it turned into something that resembled what I had in my head.
