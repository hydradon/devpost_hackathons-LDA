                    Button is a branded Web VR escape room puzzle experience for the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets that provides four increasingly difficult puzzle challenges towards a final goal.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Button was designed and built 100% in Amazon Sumerian.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Audio and soundscapes were built using creative-commons licensed samples processed in Audacity, Platinum Notes 4, and Wondershare Filmora.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A few custom textures for the end sequence were created using GIMP 2.10.6
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ended up sacrificing Google Daydream/Oculus Go VR headset support so I could use the 'VRController' component with the 'Daydream' controller ID to hack together a state-machine controlled rigid-body entity with a functional trigger collider.  This was to work around a current bug with 'entity-with-rigid-body-collider' to 'entity-with-collider' trigger not functioning properly at the moment.

                <h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I am really happy with how the branded 'billboards' turned out at the end of the experience.  I'm not a graphic designer by any means and this was my first attempt and making my own textures for use on entities.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I'm also pleased with the sound effects and overall sound engineering.

                    <li>
                        And I am very proud of my creative use of State Machine behavior logic I developed to implement puzzle functionality without having to write a single line of code.
