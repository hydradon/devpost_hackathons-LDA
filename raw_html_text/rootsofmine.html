                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After some successful manual genealogical research over several years I thought it might help a lot of people if I could automate those steps to try to bring genealogy into the 21st century.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1.) Problem:
It&rsquo;s not easy or fun to do family research
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution:
RootsOfMine provides an easy search over &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; to deliver interesting and possibly surprising results delivered to an easily editable family tree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2.) Problem: 
Family research is tedious and inefficient, usually involving doing research that&rsquo;s already been done but is hard to take advantage of.  New users are typically presented with hundreds of family trees and thousands of documents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution:
RootsOfMine offers a smart search that summarizes research from sites like FamilySearch and others.  This will only continue to get better, faster, and more accurate.  New innovations will include integrating 1930 Census data to provide more relevant results for people searching for parents and grand-parents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3.) Problem:
It&rsquo;s hard to smoothly collaborate with people to do family research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution:
                    <br>
                    RootsOfMine will integrate with GitHub as an innovative solution for smooth and efficient collaboration and social networking.  Check back on the site for this new feature at the end of December or in January.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4.) Problem:
Current genealogy sites often have inaccurate data with bad or no sources.  Much of the published data, even on major sites, is &ldquo;wishful thinking&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution:
Establish a &ldquo;Geneapedia&rdquo; that publishes data with proven sources.  This site would be a major resource on the web, not unlike Wikipedia.  RootsOfMine would use this as a first source in new searches and would be the default editor for it.
