                    FTP is a network protocol for transferring files from one location to another on the Internet. The two locations in FTP are referred to as Client and a Server. The Client requests the files from a Server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    File transfer using FTP can take place between two computers, one mobile device and a computer, or a cloud account and a computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may have heard the term FTP when someone is talking about a website. We usually use FTP to transfer website files from our computer to the hosting server. However, it can also be used to transfer files between two local computers or any other two devices connected via the same network.

                <p>
                    FTP IT app broadcasts a URL for use by any device with an internet browser to get direct access to the gallery of the Android device.

                    Android Studio 3.5.1 and Android 9 (Pie)

                    This method doesn&rsquo;t require any USB cable or even Bluetooth. The only requirement for FTP on Android is that the Android device and PC should be connected to the same Wi-Fi network. If connections to the same Wi-Fi network isn't possible, the Android device can be used to create a hotspot and then use FTP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please keep in mind, Wi-Fi connections or same network doesn&rsquo;t mean that you should have a working Internet connection. They are generally used alternatively but they differ in their meaning. Even if the Internet is not working and you're connected to the same Wi-Fi network, you can still use FTP IT app to transfer files.
