                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the style of studying that Pomodoro offers, but the lack of integrating a timer with Spotify to play and pause music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app will allow the user to authorize access to their Spotify, so that it can play and pause music based on the timer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by using React for the front end, which interacts with an express server to service some Spotify API requests. This also connects to the ASP.NET backend which allows for the storing of user accounts through Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges getting the Spotify API set up to correctly authenticate the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of a functional app that we and other students can use to help in their studies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about different technologies and APIs that some team members were unfamiliar with.

                    What's next for Pomodoro Timer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pomodoro Timer will continue to improve on its security with the user accounts, as well as improving the UI and UX of the web app in general.
