                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this app from the Nintendo Streetpass, a game that required a Nintendo 3DS and transferes Miis when you walk by someone who also has the app active. We wanted to create a social media app that spreads when you come across people who also use the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app uses geolocation to send out previous posts from people you pass by in the street, who also have the app active in the background. Upon the swapping of posts the color gradient you possess is altered to show you have come across someone new!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The workload the was split up between the server, web interface, and app. The web interface was made with php, HTML5, CSS3, and Jquery. The app was made with react-native, and the server was made with php, and mySQL.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues with our first attempt at peer to peer being only available on android 8.0, which is currently only available to the Google phones. Due to the difference in technical skill sets there were issues trying to make the technology work together.
