                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're hackathon organizers, and we always wanted a way to help hackers more easily connect with one another during the team-building activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes in profiles of hackers based on skillsets, interests, and descriptions and allows hackers to choose whether they'd like to work with certain people/teams and then we allocate hackers with others we deemed would be good fits, and the final decision would come to a team leader choose during the initial setup of the activity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built as a web app, with a Reactstrap.js front-end and a back-end using express, Node.js, and the Google Cloud Platform's Firebase cloud functions and database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a team of three where only one of us was an experienced web-developer, he ended up building the front-end almost entirely, leaving the other two of us to try and put together a back-end which was tough as we had never used JavaScript before nor JS technologies like express or Node, much less the GCP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a working, albeit incomplete demo. We're proud of what we achieved as far as all we managed to complete. Even more we're proud of our idea. We believe in it and we will continue to develop it in order to make it a working system to implement at our hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots about back-end and server-less web technologies as well as web technologies in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackerSquad
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to further develop the app to bring it into production for use in our own hackathon.
