This robot was made with raspberry pi 4, using azure api for facial recognition, and text to speech lib for python. it was pretty straightforward, we download azure api and we combined it with the text to speech lib all the raspberry pi 4 and finally we combined with a toy car for getting some mobility. Initially, the toy car was going to be controlled by the pi  but  we faced a lack of hardware so we decided to focus in a little bit in the software. We are proud that we have worked in group and even though we faced a lot issues, we ended up with a suitable software and idea to present to judges. Never go to a hackathon without carrying your own hardware  XD,  microsoft azure is very useful, python will always be preferred programming language in the incoming hackathons. Obviously, we will progess
