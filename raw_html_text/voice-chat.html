                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The bots are not smart enough yet for a real conversation with changing topics etc., so we decided to do the 1st Alexa based voice chat. Talk to real people not bots!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects two random persons and allows them to talk to each other (in Alexa's voice) being completely anonymous to each other. Any of them can drop the conversation at any time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use AWS services to connect people by establishing conversation between random two users using the skill at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Synchronization of the conversation. the necessity of at least two users (devices) using the skill concurrently, waiting to user response or till the chat partner comes online without dropping the session.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the 1st skill for a real people communication through Alexa. We proud that we founf a way to do it and implemented it in a relatively small time. We're proud to let people really talk, not just playing with bots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can do tons of things within just AWS eco-system. We can solve non trivial tasks using trivial existing services. Alexa can do more than most of us thinks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Voice Chat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User nick names support. This will allow user search and the ability to talk with the user you want not only random one (as it is now).
