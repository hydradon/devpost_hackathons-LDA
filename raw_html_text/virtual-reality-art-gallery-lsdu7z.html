                    VandyHacks VI was the perfect venue to build a hardware-powered hack that brings arts and culture to the 21st century. In a time of increasing privatization of artistic masterpieces, we wanted to preserve and celebrate art using the tech afforded to us today. For us, this meant designing a virtual reality experience.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project boasts 3 servers that communicate integral information to each other. First, there is the main web server that hosts the VR framework in javascript and html. Second, there is a CORS proxy server to support cross-origin content. Third, there is a python-powered Raspberry Pi to take in bluetooth input from a DualShock 4 controller and send such to the main VR server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The image scraping process was certainly the most trying. There are very few public and fetchable art libraries, and most have low request limits. We opted to store the works ourselves to minimize the chances of technical error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We pride ourselves on getting all devices, servers, and interfaces to communicate well with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What each of us learned certainly goes down to the individual level as we possess differing experience in 36-hour hacking. Thomas came out a better CORS server troubleshooter. Hans boats becoming familiar with API and library implementation. Navarone was previously unfamiliar with javascript and html and comes out with invaluable exposure to web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Virtual Reality Art Gallery
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A more diverse array of art in addition to an informational blurb for each display in the gallery. Additionally, we would design a museum-like virtual world, in lieu of the enclosure for the art to be housed in.
