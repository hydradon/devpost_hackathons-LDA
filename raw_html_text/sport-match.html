                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Why waste time swiping when you could spend time loving and sporting? Frustrated by having to manicuring a dating profile once every month, I want someone who shares one of my favorite interest - sport. It's time to hang out, to love, to Sport Match!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sport Match scrapes Twitter data and finds people who have tweeted at the home base stadium of your favorite team. It then shows you how dedicated these people are to the sport by showing you the tweets they made about the sport and team you love.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my very first webapp. I spent the first half of the hackathon learning the Python web framework Flask and the other half implementing my idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I suck at front-end design. The already-horrible interface is the result of my struggling to create a presentable application. However, I am proud that I stuck with doing something I am not comfortable with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that it runs! And the fact that it can display a small picture of the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask framework, tiny bit of Javascript and HTML in action, the location of Match.com
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sport Match
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many more features I want to implement: the ability to like users, the ranking of their tweets on how sport-spirited they are, plugins from other social media,...
