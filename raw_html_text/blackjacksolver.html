                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We felt it would be an interesting way to implement our mathematics and computer science abilities to a real world application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on certain card inputs, two percentages are returned.
                    <br>
                    One will be the percentage of not busting, and the other will be the percentage of getting a perfect Blackjack.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With skills developed in the last 36 hours.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ANDROID STUDIO.  There were minor issues with android studio auto-generating files which caused issues and merge conflicts in git that often slowed us down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IT'S DONE.  We switched to the project at 2PM on Saturday.  So we are all proud to have only had about half the hackathon left while still completing what we hoped to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ANDROID STUDIO is really not great.  And perseverance even with less time available.
