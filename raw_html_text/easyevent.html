                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>    John Smith, 22, an Information System Graduate Student from Seidenberg School, Pace University. He knew Entrepreneurship Lab at Pace University have a lot of interesting events every semester, so he subscribed &ldquo;Entrepreneurship Lab Pace University&rdquo; account a long time ago. Recently he received a notification about Pace Mobile App Design Contest 4.0 held by Entrepreneurship Lab from EasyEvent. He RSVPed and registered the event successfully. He could always follow up the event in his profile if anything (Time, Location&hellip;) changes.
            John Smith, is also interested in museum things. He wants to subscribe some famous museums in New York City and know their events. He types &ldquo;museum in New York&rdquo; in the search bar and then a lot of museums will pop up. He subscribes some museums he likes, for example, MET and MOMA. If there are some upcoming events, John will receive the notification in our app. 
   As a student who will graduate this year, John also wants to find a job this year. He knows students organizations like Beta Alpha Psi, Ascend and ALPHA have information sessions of big companies every week, which will provide full-time job opportunities for students, so he subscribes those three organizations. In addition, trying to get the first hand information about recruiting from his dream companies, he also subscribes companies like EY, PwC, and so on in case of missing any important chance.

                    b.  Idea:
 Brief Introduction: EasyEvent is a platform that allows event organizers (companies, governments, schools, individuals and so on) to create their own accounts and post their events. Users are able to join the organizations of their interest and RSVP to attend their events. Some events are available for all and some are only for a group of people which they need to subscribe in order to view the group activities.
 Advantages: Unlike Eventbrite or Meetup, every event organizer in EasyEvent has a permanent account to post events. Attendees can subscribe the organizations they are interested in, or use the key words to search the events they like. For example, Pace University, posts a Job Fair event on April 16th on its account. I, as a Pace University Student, have already subscribed that Account and got the notification from EasyEvent. If I want to go, just RSVP. After I register the event successfully, I can find that event in my profile. 
 Every individual have the liberty to search their industry of interest and get involved to contribute in their social activities. This also helps to grow in all aspects of life as an individual personality and contribute towards the betterment of society.
 Simplicity: It is easier for event organizers to promote the event, instead of creating an event on Eventbrite, send out the link though emails, FB, and Twitter. The only thing the organizer should do is to post all of its events under its account for attendees to look up. For attendees, it&rsquo;s easier for them to know the events held by event organizers they are interested in. They don&rsquo;t need to search events from different organizations&rsquo; website, FB, and Twitter. When you subscribe the account, you won&rsquo;t miss any important events any more of that account. 
 User-Friendly: Users can also use their Facebook or Twitter Accounts to register. All events are available to share on FB, Twitter, Instagram, and any other social media. EasyEvent is supported on every platform: iOS, android, windows, blackberry, and web app.
 Future Perspective: If any event organizer wants to boost its event through our app, we can charge some money, or we can charge some convenience fees from paid tickets.
