                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many immigrants can have trouble understanding societal norms of a new community, or simply learning things that we consider common sense due to our experiences. Our site can help these individuals get in contact with people who can help teach them and can also relate to their unique culture.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Foreign born individuals can use our site to get in contact with a
                    <strong>
                        mentor
                    </strong>
                    , who has been through similar situations to them, and are able to provide advice for adaptation into their new cultures and communities.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded our website with the application
                    <a href="https://atom.io" rel="nofollow">
                        Atom
                    </a>
                    , and used HTML, CSS (and Bootstrap), and Javascript (and jQuery).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A particular challenge we faced was translating our whole website into whatever the language the user desires or requires, due to many immigrants not speaking English as their first language or at all. We wanted to make sure that our site was easy to use for anyone, no matter their prior opportunities.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of our
                    <strong>
                        live chat feature
                    </strong>
                    that allows the user to easily and immediately get in contact with a mentor, and our
                    <strong>
                        translation feature
                    </strong>
                    that ensures the website is accessible for everyone.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about web development when it comes to the problem solving aspect, as we had to use critical thinking skills to come up with a solution to the prompt and create a functional solution in a very limited time.
