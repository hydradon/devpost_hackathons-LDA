                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MIT made an online site called "MIT Scratch" that aimed to teach children how coding works. From here, we wanted to expand on the idea and make an interface that could support more complicated concepts that frustrate fresh enrolls into Computer Science departments at colleges, such as object-oriented programming and parallel processing concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "OO Deploy" is a web interface GUI which allows users to visualize and create classes in C++. Once a user is done with their code, they are able to download their header and implementation files to use in their projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was built from the AngularJS paradigm, interweaving Bootstrap with basic HTML, CSS3, and jQuery to get the experience we wanted to present to potential users.  The two of us communicated heavily throughout the project, always ensuring we were on the same page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sam: I have never done any front-end development before in my life; I've always focused on the back-end and algorithm development. I was super excited to try something brand new, and my first exposure with web dev was watching some AngularJS tutorials online on the drive up from Tennessee. Most of the challenges I ran into were syntax and architecture-based. There was a decent learning curve going from no knowledge at all to being able to finish out a project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sam: Completing this project with half of the team being completely new to the entire tech stack is definitely something I'm proud of. Being able to see the site function and do its purpose is incredibly fulfilling. The end result actually ended up better than I expected, and I can see myself using this tool to help me finish projects faster in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sam: I learned a lot about web development; actually, everything I know about web development I learned this weekend. I feel accomplished regarding both the structure of a webpage's code and the overall UX design of the site. I became familiar with design strategies for the web and look forward to developing my skills further with time. I also got experience working in a small team -- in the past I've worked with teams as large as 12 people. The agility of a small team is surprising.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OO Deploy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to incorporate even better features to aid users visualize computer science concepts. After allowing users to work on their driver files, we hope to implement more complicated concepts such as parallel processing.
