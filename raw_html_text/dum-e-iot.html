                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We watched the iron man movie and decided that while Jarvis may still be years off, robotic arm swarms are here today. Or rather, they weren't yesterday, but are now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build a series of 3 (although could be more) robotic arms that can be controlled from anywhere in the world simultaneously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the arms using a series of laser cut and 3D printed parts. The coding for the arms was done using a NodeMCU Wi-Fi enabled arduino chip. The server coding was done in HTML/CSS/JavaScript with a backend written in Node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, the queue for the laser cutter.
Beyond that we had trouble ensuring the arms would be strong enough to move by themselves and react appropriately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pretty much the whole thing :)
We are particularly proud of the mechanical design of the arms, and the way with which the servos are incorporated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about CAD modeling and how to cut interlocking gears on a laser cutter. We also learned how to interface a micro-controller with a web server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dum-E IOT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally world domination. In the long term. Short term we will settle for polishing our design and ideally using it as a kit to help teach robotics to people new to the field who wish to learn a bit of design, a bit of fabrication, a bit of wiring, and a bit of coding.
