                    We tried to create this project in hopes of providing a better and more tailored learning environment for students. We have never personally seen any applications or websites that provide a place for students to interact with not only students of the same education level but with their lecturers/tutors too, as well as having the option to participate in quizzes and tasks set by their professors/teachers and gain a cumulative score to be featured in leaderboards or redeem certain prizes with their scores (as an incentive). We feel that this makes learning more fun and interactive, especially for younger students. However, we were not able to successfully get the project working as we faced many errors while using Django as we were new to this aspect of web dev using Python. We had issues in the command line with version incompatibility, server issues, and the creation of the chatroom using Twilio. Though we were not able to produce a working project at the end of this event, we are still happy that we were able to expose ourselves to a new way of web dev.
