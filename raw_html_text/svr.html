                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a consumer, you have access to all the different online shops, but it can be hard to compare prices across websites. With SVR the consumer has a fast and transparent way to find the cheapest products across the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It makes it easy for the consumer to find the cheapest product across all websites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this application to make sense, it has to be simple for the consumer. So we put a lot of energy into creating a simple frontend webdesign. We then fetched the data we needed from the best API's on the market including google shopping for a fast and reliable search across all webshops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was to prioritise which features to include. In the beginning we had planned to include TomToms 
api, and create an application that could find the cheapest products close to the consumer. But this turned out the be quite difficult, because we could not find the right API on the product side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our ability to create a truly useful product for the consumer in only 24 hours, it really puts in perspective on how much you can produce in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned the importance of focus and teamwork. It is the first time the three of us have tried to work on a project together, so it has been fun to learn from each other and create a truly epic product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also we have realized the power of API's. It is amazing the applications you can build with them relatively easy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Saver
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step is to include used products as well. We are really passioned about the climate change, and the consumerism is a big part of that problem. So by finding the cheapest used products the consumer can both be saving more money, and help the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Afterwords, we are going to create the location-based search. So the consumer can choose to find the cheapest store in the area.
