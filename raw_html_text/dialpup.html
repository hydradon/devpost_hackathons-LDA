                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Canada has the most expensive data plans in the
                    <strong>
                        entire world!
                    </strong>
                    All our phone plans come with unlimited calling anyways, so why not harnass that for _ free _ dial-up-like internet?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DialPup turns your internet traffic into audio and sends it over a regular phone call, giving you a slow but usable Internet connection anywhere you have cell service - no data plan needed!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a huge amalgamation of languages and frameworks, DialPup connects your phone call to a VoIP client through Twilio and SIP to turn your internet traffic into audio - just like a dial-up modem. This project uses Node.js, Python, C, and at some points even used Java! DialPup also incorporates a tiny piece of custom hardware made out of electrical tape, cables and developer's tears.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I scrapped the project halfway through! Switching libraries sucked, but it had to be done to make things work. Phone audio is also
                    <em>
                        really
                    </em>
                    low quality, so you can't get very high bandwidth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a SIP VoIP client and getting some data transferred over audio!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about frequency-shift encoding - turning bytes into sound is really cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DialPup
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A full internet proxy, rather than simple data transfer - use apps, interactive websites, and even play some games over the connection on your computer!
