                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The advances in computer vision and the smart home security systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses a camera to save faces, which it can later detect. If it finds an unknown face, it sends an email plays a sound and sends a notification to the Google Home device. It also has a webpage in which a use can register and login in order to see the camera feed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the webpage using HTML,CSS,PHP and Bootstrap. We used 2 libraries in order to recognize faces and send notifications to google home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Providing a fast way to display the image feed on the webpage. The python script which is in the scripts folder saves the image in that folder, which is later accessed by php and only displayed if the user is logged in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud for implementing our home security system using face recognition and integrating a consumer product like Google home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned better how to use OpenCV and how face recognition algorithms work.
                </p>

                    What's next for Security System / Smart Doorbell
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The layout of the webpage can be improved and a proper email solution can be implemented.
