                    Non-profits and activist organizations struggle with finding and affording creative people to work on media design and promotion for their campaigns, and approaching people to work for free can be disrespectful because it diminishes the value of creative work. As media students entering the professional world, we see a need for opportunities to hone our skills and build our portfolios. At the same time, media students and professionals want to be socially engaged and contribute their skills, be a part of a cause they care about. Our project,
                    <strong>
                        Creativist
                    </strong>
                    , matches Campaigners with content creators to foster rewarding and impactful collaborative relationships.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our platform will make design activism more accessible by helping campaigners and creators connect on small and large scales. Non-profit Campaigners can share their cause and the media content they seek, while Creativist volunteers who are looking for meaningful portfolio building opportunities can step up to help them. Campaigners will have access to a network of enthusiastic and talented people who understand the value of volunteering for their cause. Meanwhile, Creativists will be able to actively contribute to causes they care about instead of just clicking a button in support.
