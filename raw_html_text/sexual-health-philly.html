                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team that is passionate about both sexual health and public services, so Health Philly was a natural thing to produce. In a world where resources are often more available than information about those resources, we hope to fill that gap, since we noticed that many scattered resources exist but no one-size-fits-all option.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Health Philly is a mobile-friendly web app that displays data &amp; resources related to sexual health, healthcare, abuse, and more in the Philadelphia area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Health Philly was built on top of a Django back-end, integrating leaflet.js for map display and Python for data parsing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting leaflet.js to work properly (and update on changes in search) was a huge struggle, but ultimately worth it for the extra utility of location-based service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we were most proud of our ability to finish our first Hackathon, while producing something that could make an actionable difference in the Philly region!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several of our team members were unfamiliar with Django before this project, so they certainly learned (in a trial-by-fire situation!) a new skill. We were also able to build rapport with some new members and integrate them into the team that already knew each other well.
