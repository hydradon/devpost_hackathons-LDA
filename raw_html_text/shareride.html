                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired by the posts on the facebook that there are always some friends who don&rsquo;t have cars, and they need a ride to somewhere else.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application can match a person who is driving to somewhere and another person who is seeking for a ride.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Esri ARCGIS Routing API in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the most difficult part is to understand how each part of the API works and to leverage the API to build the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The matching is very accurate. The user will have a list of candidates to choose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to read a whole new API document and its sample code.
                </p>

                    What's next for ShareRide
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Return the list of matching to the user. Recognize different user. Implement a mobile client.
