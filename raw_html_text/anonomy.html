                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As new high school coders, we wanted to make something that was meaningful, especially for kids our age. As of right now, teens are highly susceptible to mental illnesses, and it's no surprise why. High school and post secondary students are under lots of stress to meet responsibilities, deadlines, and figure out what they want to do with their careers. However, during our research of this topic, we found a Lifeline article that stated 75% of people suffering from mental illness do not even actively seek help due to the negative stigma surrounding their condition. This is when we came up with the idea to create an anonymous method for these people to receive help in order to bypass this insecurity, and allow them to talk to trained professionals that can truly turn their life around.

                    Anomony is a web application which allows people with mental health problems to have anonymous, direct contact with qualified therapists. Through a text chat system and a non-identifying registration process, users can seek help in pure anonymity, since they do not have to physically attend therapy, and they have no need to disclose their private information to anyone on the web app. When users register, they will be prompted with an option to get matched with a therapist, or be a therapist. The users will then go through a filtration system. If they chose to seek help, they will check off different symptoms of their situation, and our algorithm will match the user with a therapist who is skilled in those particular fields. Similarly, if they chose to be a therapist, they will choose different fields that they are skilled in, and they will be matched with individuals who have those symptoms. This web app gives the 75% of individuals who are shunned by mental health stigma a platform to help themselves, and for therapists to help people in need.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We built our website using Firebase and React. To display our webpage, we used HTML and CSS within React components. We also used Firebase for our database and user authentication.
