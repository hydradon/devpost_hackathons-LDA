                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Faced with today's debates over topics such as fossil fuels, electric cars, and global warming, we wanted to make a program to help the user choose what the best environmentally friendly solution might be when considering buying a new car.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can input the efficiency, and state that you reside in to determine how long it will take to offset the increased carbon output of manufacturing an electric car. Depending on which state you live in, the time it takes to offset the extra carbon will vary. You can also see how much carbon each vehicle will emit in a year based on the number of miles driven in a year you specified. One last thing you can see is how much money you save on fuel driving the electric car over the gasoline car based on the fuel prices you entered.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program was built in Java with Java Swing as the GUI Handler.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we had planned on writing this in Python, assuming that writing GUI's in Python would be relatively easy. However, most had little to no experience writing GUI's, so the learning curve ended up being quite steep. We had to decide whether to put in time to learn the GUI or to just translate to Java and take advantage of one our member's knowledge of Java Swing. In the end, we ended up converting to Java.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The GUI ended up looking pretty nice, and we gathered a bunch of data to be able to perform calculations based on state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may have spent too much time trying to make it look nice instead of implementing more features. Time management is a big one that we always struggle with during Hackathons, as each decision has its trade-offs, but we are learning how to manage our time in order to better meet the requirements of the project in the specified amount of time.
