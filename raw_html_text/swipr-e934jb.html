                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help hungry students with the extra meal swipes rather than wasting them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it functions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is used by two types of people: students who would like to use their meal swipe on another student "Generous" and students that needs food "Hungry". The app connects the generous to the hungry and then notifies the users as soon as they have been matched.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google's firebase to connect the "Generous" students to the "Hungry" students by storing this data in a hash table. We used Nexmo's sms messaging API to notify a hungry student that they have been matched with a generous student. The generous student then gets the hungry student's name on the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a difficult time implementing Google's firebase platform, but we were able to overcome this problem by seeking help from the mentors here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we made a finished working mobile application and is the solution to a very common problem at Rutgers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned from this project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Google's firebase, Nexon's messaging API, and the importance of collaboration in a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Future Plans
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to scale Swipr to have the app available in other colleges as well. We would also like to donate the food from extra meal swipes to homeless people as well.
