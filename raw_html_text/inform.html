                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've heard a lot about fake news floating around so we wanted to create a website to tackle this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has the most current news from all over the world and provides multiple perspectives on everything to ensure that it is unbiased. We also include an unbiased background to educate people about the issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML and CSS and we used a text editor called Atom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us did not know anything about HTML so we had to teach ourselves a whole new language. It was also difficult to write the background section without being biased.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We taught ourselves a new language and managed to make a fully functional website using our new skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our entire team learned something new. We taught ourselves HTML and we also learned more about current events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Inform
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add a section where people can send in stories about events that benefit them and they can be posted on our page. We'd also like to expand and cover more events, as our current website only has information about one event. This will hopefully make the app even more user friendly.
