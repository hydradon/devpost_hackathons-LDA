                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Applying a modern approach to an age-old device. Additionally, we wanted to enhance the concept of the original magic mirror by integrating a contact free interface approach, to further streamline the user experience.

                <p>
                    Fuse is a smart home device that acts as a personal assistant in the form of a mirror. With Fuse you can get ready for your day which taking in important info about your own schedule and the world around you.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardware portion consists of a barebones monitor attached behind a two-way glass pane. With this setup, we can display text and other images through a reflective material.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The software consists of almost 100% Javascript. We used various frameworks/libraries including AngularJS, JQuery, Foundation, and LeapJS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cutting proper dimensions of wood for the frame.
Gestures not functioning in LeapJS so we had to write an algorithm to detect them ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
