                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Syneract is aimed towards hospital patients who may not be physically able to visit their friends, but still want to be able to play games with them. It provides a fun way for patients who may not be able to leave the hospital to still interact with their friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Syneract is a hub for interactive games which you can play with your friends. It uses the Leap Motion as the controller for the games, and it allows you to communicate and play with your friends at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Syneract's frontend and the game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the backend in Node.js. The game uses the Leap Motion as its primary input method. The communication over the network is done using Socket.io. The website itself is hosted on Amazon Web Services using a domain name purchased from Domain.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into was the synchronization of the game over the network. We were able to have a version of this working where we can see the other player's gun sight on your screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of having built a game that uses the Leap Motion as a controller that actually works pretty well. Also, the landing page looks boss.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with Leap Motion, how Amazon Web Services works, and how much of a pain network communication is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Syneract
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we plan to add more games to Syneract so that it becomes a veritable hub for interactive games. Also, we plan to add video chatting capabilities so that you are able to video chat with your friends as you play games with them.
