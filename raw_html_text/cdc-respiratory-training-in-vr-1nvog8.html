                    What it does

                <p>
                    For this current build, users can learn more about different type of respiratory masks and proper way to use them by interacting with objects in Virtual Reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was built using Unity 3D, with a mix of free and custom-built assets. All audio files were custom made as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project sounded simple at first until we started looking more into it, and realize the scope was much larger than available time. Our team also comprised of only 5 people, with only 2 people familiar with Unity, and majority of the members were first-time hackathon attendee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A working prototype! Especially since we didn't get our VR system to work until 5 pm on Saturday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we researched and designed our project, we learned more about different type of respiratory masks, how to put them and take them off properly, different tests that needed to be performed for certification, and many more. We also learned the hard way that PC VR system such as Oculus Rift will not run on a PC that has no main monitor.
                </p>
