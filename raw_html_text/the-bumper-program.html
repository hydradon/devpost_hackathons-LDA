                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NYC, Philly and Baltimore are cities that suffer from aggressive potholes. While visiting their hackathons, we learned about some challenges they face, and were inspired to build a solution.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to deputize citizens to volunteer their time and drive through the city with the app on, recording critical data on where potholes are.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bump It Up! uses an iOS App to record y-axis Accelerometer Data which signifies the iOS device encountering "bumps" or potholes in the road. Once the drive is done, it sends it to a backend database where a script runs to identify the potholes. Finally, there are two outputs - a Google Maps interface and a public facing RESTful API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determining what the algorithm should be to that indicates a "bump" was challenging. Further, pushing the data from the iOS device to the server in a proper dictionary was strangely a challenge.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found two use cases for this project - both a Google Maps Visualizations and a public-facing RESTful API - which can be used to benefit the community.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Specifically, our teammate Ashton Welles - a beginner to the hacking world - learned a significant amount about web development and impressed us all with his progress. Huge shoutout to him!
