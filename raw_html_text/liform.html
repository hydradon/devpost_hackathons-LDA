                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Liform was designed to address the rising cost of healthcare by empowering patients to make informed decisions about care options. We want to make it easy for patients to analyze cost differences across healthcare providers.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many hospitals have publicly available data from that details the estimated cost a patient will incur for a certain procedure or diagnosis. However, this data is often unreadable by humans or otherwise useless for patients. Liform provides the ability for users to search for a DRG (Diagnostic Related Group) code to find the price typically paid by patients with that DRG code at different hospitals. It also provides an interface for importing new hospital data to the Liform database. Additionally, Liform allows patients to report the amount they paid at a certain hospital, allowing users to compare the prices that other patients paid for certain DRG code.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Publicly available hospital data comes in a variety of formats and structures. In order to get this data into our database, we needed a way to get it into a standard format. To support the most common formats, XLSX and CSV, Aditya wrote a script to standardize the data.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us became more experienced with React while working on the front-end, while others received more experience on the back-end. Most importantly, we learned
                    <em>
                        how to hackathon
                    </em>
                    . This was our first hackathon, and we grew as a team and as developers.
