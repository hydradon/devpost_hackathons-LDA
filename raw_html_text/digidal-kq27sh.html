                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The lack of convenience of carrying around a student ID card to get dorm and room access
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user can enter their ID card and be able to use NFC to scan a RFID access point with their phone instead of their card
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to create an android app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NFC is difficult to implement
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had great teamwork and sharing of ideas
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to plan first and implement after
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DigIDal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to allow users(students) to be able to login to their .edu account and automatically have their ID card registered and ready to scan.
