                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People need more help when they go shopping, so this app is particularly useful for them. It aims to help them to increase the efficiency of buying products, and also improve time management and organisation skills.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We were trying to design the app that will take the customer's preferences of various products. Then, we were creating a list where the choices can be added to, changed, or extracted from. We also designed it in a way that the information was kept regardless whether the app is open or not.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be implemented: our app was supposed to also search on google the products and update the map, notifying when the customer is nearby the store where the item is sold. Also, there were supposed to be pictures from the internet for each product.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to create this.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were completely new to Android Studio, therefore half of the time we spent on learning how to use it. Also, the hardest part was the the implementation of google search. We were able to download the images from theirs URLs using picasso library, but didn't succeed in getting the actual URL. The problem was that we were not able to get free Google APIs, so we had to implement them from scratch, and ran out of time.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That was the first experience for Thomas and me in app development, and I think we did well taking into account that we were completely unfamiliar with Android Studio. 
Also, it was only 2 of us in the team, so it was really hard t finish such a project on time.
