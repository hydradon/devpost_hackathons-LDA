                    Whether you're a student or a project manager, everyone runs into the problem of scheduling groups of people to meet for a period of time.

                    This service takes in everyone's available times and runs an algorithm to figure out the best available time where the most/all people can partake in a certain event.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We focused on the model-view-controller design pattern; using the framework web2py. The languages we developed in are Python, SQLite, HTML/CSS, Javascript/Jquery/JSON. We kept our version control using Git and communicated through Slack.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Not everyone could be present at all times during development, which slowed down progress. As a team, we were not familiar with many of the tools and technologies

                        (Firechat, Full Calendar API, etc.)

                    At the very least: it ran, shows our idea, and demonstrated our overall development skills. We can actually make something!

                        Time.
                    </em>
                    We learned how to really manage our time properly and really crank something out when it came down to it.

                        Research skills.
                    </em>
                    Google was our best friend and we learned how to utilize it to it's maximum potential.

                    <em>
                        Communication.
                    </em>
                    Overall, through different levels of experience, we were able to learn how to communicate with one another and create something pretty cool.

                    We want to be able to scale up our project by changing web platforms to a more stable environment. We also want to expand our services not only to web but also to mobile.
