                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got to talking with one of the participants at the pre-hackathon mixer and became intrigued about playing with commoditizing and regulating social reform. Twitter and Facebook have, unfortunately, commoditized social interaction in a sense, the Steam gaming community has commoditized gaming with its hugely expansive and current library, etc. I figured it's time to allow individuals to plot and strategize for themselves in a world where political leaders are irresponsibly pinning them between the walls!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It enters data based on three metrics, time, in years spent on your agenda, progress, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being complete, and expense, negative being in a revenue deficit from your campaign or journey or positive if you are generating profit, in tens of dollars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I loved the topological computation available through Wolfram Mathematica and Wolfram|One software, which really enabled me to see how an individual could relate their visual progress to the ideal progress of humanity, represented as a sphere whose surface area is in "progress-years-dollars per average generation globally".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with the iOS SDK. There were all sorts of little nuances that kept me out of loop in terms of fast-forwarding my code, such as the selections in Xcode and the ever-changing integration of source files with iOS storyboards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I ran my simulator to the point that the flow was smooth and desirable, I was pleased. Feeling in control of the simulator gave me a sense of direction in SDK development for iOS in the Swift Programming Language, something I was entirely new to prior to the hackathon. I possess the ability to learn things quickly, almost instantaneously. I hoped I put it to good use in enabling the average person with an iPhone to strategize effectively based on their self-appraised socio-economic ranking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To another person who was about to join me, my idea sounded like, in his words, an "acid trip". Individuals can have a lack of awareness of what works and what doesn't work in a team setting, myself included. Perhaps I was just nervous in pitching my idea! :)
                </p>

                <p>
                    It will remain a hobbyist project of mine for sometime and I hope individuals may benefit.
