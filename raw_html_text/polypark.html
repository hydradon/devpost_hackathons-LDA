                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some people in my group were unable to find parking today due to the event, and we wanted to figure out a way to make finding parking information easier than just navigating to the website and scrolling to look for announcements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides an easy way for users to find out parking information based on enforcement hours, time, and if they have a special permit.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UX: We started with no clear direction on how we wanted to structure the interface. Through iteration, user interviews, and talking with our dev team, we managed to limit our interactions to feature the most important information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DEV: We started with no prior experiences with Android development nor database and did not have a clear direction of how our project would be structured. We spent a lot of our time looking at tutorials on how to develop for Android and how to fetch from our database (written in json because we decided that Firebase or SQL would take to long to set up and run). We were going to use the Google Maps API to have an interactive map but did not have time either.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DEV: We learnt a lot about working with databases and Android development even though we might not be able to implement those very well yet. We also got to cooperate with new friends to brainstorm and implement a new idea.
UX: We really enjoyed learning about how to incorporate our user research into how to improve the function of this app.
