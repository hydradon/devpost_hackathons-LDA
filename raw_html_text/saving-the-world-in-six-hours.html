                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal today is to Save The World by connecting you and your loved ones around you. Here at STWISH, we allow a user to maintain a small, minimal-effort journal about their health, habits, and happiness. What really makes STWISH special is not only the ability of your approved loved ones to see your personal updates, but also to be notified when your journal entries imply a difficult time for you. They'll be there, ready to help you before you even have to ask.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    STWISH allows users who battle with substance abuse and mental illness to create accounts committing to keeping a daily journal. These accounts store an emergency contact. When the user doesn't update every day, the emergency contact is contacted via SMS with a message informing the contact to reach out to the user and check-in on them. It also sends a message if we noticed a change in their normal behavior for 3 days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python2 and mongodb, we built the frontend and the backend. We also used the Twilio API to send messages via SMS.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed this in 6 hours and lots of debugging errors.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Made the whole thing in 6 hours.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Six Hours are just enough but more is better. As we worked, we realized how useful this could be to people struggling with substance abuse or mental health.
