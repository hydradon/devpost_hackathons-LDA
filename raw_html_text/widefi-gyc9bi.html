                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people including some of our group members do not have data on our moblie devices. So in order to solve this issue, we decided to bring WiFi and internet to this without data, promoting equality for technology and providing data for the less fortunate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project is to provide many internet based functions such as google searches, map directions,  weather updates and uber calls to individuals without data. The user will activate these functions be sending a text to a certain number. Through that number  it will use a server to prompt the function and generate an answer for the user. The answer will then be texted back for the user, thus no data or WiFi will be needed fro the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this with the combination of Java, Twilio, and StdLib (A simple, collaborative programming model for the web). We were able to set up the server to receive the text with twilio and the code was written in java to allow twilio to communicate with the stdlib functions. The stdlib function is used to returned an answer to the user. We used spark and ngrok to host the twilio server and get responses live.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of  the major challenges we ran into was inplementing the Uber API. The Uber API was very complicated for us to inplement because we had no experience working with the API and the API itself was extremely complex for our group. Unfortunately, we were not able to implement this function as it was too difficult for us to do, however we would definitely like to implement once we are more experienced with this API and how it can be implemented. Another challenge we ran into was to implement Amazon Alexa because our original idea included  a function where we can communicate with alexa through a distance phone call and have Alexa accomplish inputs for us such as turning down the house heater, but this was not possible as Alexa cannot be reached through a phone call. Other challenges including being able to receive all the data and make use of it effectively. This was done very effectively through the use of spark and hosted with ngrok. We were then able to connect it to the Twilio API.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of this idea that we came up with because we believe that this can be useful for many people across the globe as data is very expensive and many places do not have WiFi. Furthermore, we are proud that we were able to create a server host with Twilio, Java and StdLib because we spent over 3 hours of research on the topics relating to servers.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many things such as how to implement different APIs into a Java project as we were able incorporate a weather and texting API and the stdlib API into our java project. Furthermore, we learned valuable teamwork skills and how to work in a timeconstriant as we started at 5:00pm on Saturday due to school assignments that were due.

                    What's next for WideFy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Future Plan for WideFy consists of adding additional functionalities as were have set it up so it easily expandable. Additional functions include having users being able to interact with a larger variety of apps such as uber and many social platforms simply through text commands without the use of data.
