                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    We come from Mexico, things there are a lot harder, partially because the lack of help, shelter and food. 
Organizations, like St.Patrick and All Others are our daily inspiration, in our mission to hack for the greater good.

                <p>
                    What we found is that this so called "Vanguard" is unarmed against some of the threats, homeless people face. What we really looked for, is to make a software to unite, all the organizations, and tools into a web platform, that connects,

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We were worried of the system alienating the most veteran of helpers.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The simple fact of knowing all those wonderful people, and the possibility to help is something beyond our wildest dreams.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Things are different, in a good way no, because we have gained a bigger perspective of how people in need live and fight against their situation, and how this support capabilities and structure really make a difference.
We think that if, in anyway, this project can strengthen this network of support and make it more accessible, we are, slowly, but surely in the right path for a better world, a world where human systems, and technological ones help each other, not erase each other.

                    See how the organizations would fare with the tool, find a way to make the app an _ organic _ implementation for their lives, not just a tool, also, the whole community may be involved if properly implemented, we have lots of crowd-driven projects, why not community-driven
