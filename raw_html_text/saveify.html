                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our daily struggles as University students to spend appropriately. When you get busy with school and homework, it's easy to forget how much you're spending but now with Saveify, we have created an effective solution.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saveify asks a series of questions based on a variety of expenses an average University student would experience and provides a recommendation on how they can save money, by comparing their expenses to the average Ontario University student.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Majority of the team members were not familiar with JavaScript so we struggled in implementing it into our code and connecting it to our HTML and CSS files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of JavaScript and how to execute a javascript function when clicking a button in our HTML page.
