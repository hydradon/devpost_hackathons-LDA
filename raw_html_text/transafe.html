                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something that could have a profound, direct impact on the Detroit community. Since we now know that the public transit system isn't exactly ideal, we wanted to make it better, safer, and more efficient to get around Detroit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app allows you to input your beginning and final destination and finds the quickest route by avoiding high crime areas. On the map, these areas of town are shaded and color coded by crime rate so that the user knows exactly where these areas are and how to avoid them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using bootstrap and react for the front-end and node.js for the back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, coming up with an idea was extremely tough because there was a lot that we wanted our app to be able to do to provide the user with the best possible experience. We realized, however, that this wasn't scalable within 36 hours especially due to limits with retrieving all of the data that we'd need. Other issues include problems with certain technology that we originally intended to use.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that we were able to successfully build our project with plenty of time left to spare for testing and to make changes and improvements. Everybody went super hard the first night to ensure that a good amount of the project was done so I'm proud of my teammates for grinding through this hackathon.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a bit of technology but even more this weekend, I learned about how to work with a team. We bounced ideas off of each other, talked through everything, and did what we needed to implement. I got a better idea of tech in the "real world" and as always at hackathons, learned so much more this weekend than I ever would have sitting in a lecture.

                    What's next for TranSafe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As briefly mentioned above, there are quite a few additional features we'd like to add given more time to work on it. These include finding and being able to filter routes based on wait times, whether the bus has cameras or not, weather updates that may affect routes, and a more detailed schedule with an accurate ETA. Given more time to get all of this data and implement it, there could be some major improvements made with people's experience with public transportation in Detroit.
