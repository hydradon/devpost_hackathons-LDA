                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Defendants are always forgetting about their court dates and payment dates.  Now they don't have to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a simple voice request Alexa can tell defendants when their next court date is, when their next payment is due, what their case balance is, and how much their next payment is for.  Additionally, the public can learn more about the court like hours of operation, address, and phone numbers.

                    How I built it

                <p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    This is only my second Alexa app so I still had a lot of learning to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app has a lot of functionality especially when you consider I wrote it in two months by myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
