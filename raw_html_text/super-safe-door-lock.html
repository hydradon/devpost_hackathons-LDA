                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed a project idea, and had an Arduino kit. so going though the kit we brainstormed while searching though the parts, and we came up with the idea to create a door security system senses we had the parts we needed in the kit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This system uses an RFIO read to read a key fob that can open a door as well it has a numbered keypad. so the user has the choice to use the fob or the key code. Also there is a two step verification with a mobile phone app that has a dynamic key to open the door.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using an Arduino mega,python code, aws database, a mobile phone app.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    hosting the database and connecting to it what challenging at first.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The working Arduino with pushing that data into an aws database.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned a lot about the aws services.

                    What's next for Super Safe Door Lock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future would be to support more than one device. for example multiple doors.
