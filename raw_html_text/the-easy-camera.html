                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friend has a hard time using her new camera she got and shes left handed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It makes it easier for the person to take pictures and may appeal to younger audience, also will come for both right and left handed people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a program called Sketchup 2016 which was a great help on how my design will look
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge I ran into was the placement of the button, I wanted it make it easy for the user to turn it on and off and also take pictures
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made it also for left handed people, I noticed that most of the supplies that I use as a right handed person may be hard to use for a left handed person. I did some research and found out that many left handed people die using right handed tools
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the most of the things we use are meant for right handed people, I also learned that there is no camera meant for left handed and right handed people
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Easy Camera
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to make it a real thing and test it so I can see some of my mistakes and make it easier and better for the user to have a better experience
                </p>
                <p>
                    I sit in Table 19, first table; I may have the 3-D version printed by then
                </p>
