                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My mom runs a small business. She often stresses out about how much time is required to keep up a social media presence. For DerbyHacks 2, I automated the news with Markov chains. This year, GPT2 produces much more convincing output, so I decided that I'd do the world another service and automate social media as well. This time, I managed to drag some other people down with me.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project has two parts. First, it scrapes the Twitter account of a given user and trains a machine learning model based on those Tweets. Second, it generates new Tweets with that model and posts them on a user-determined schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The poorly-documented but very powerful python-twitter wrapper allowed me to get Tweets pretty easily. It can also post them without too much of a challenge. The real unexplored territory was setting up GPT2 with TensorFlow and fine-tuning the model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Windows doesn't use standard UTF-8 character encoding. It also doesn't have a package manager.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    We can successfully impersonate the President of the United States.
