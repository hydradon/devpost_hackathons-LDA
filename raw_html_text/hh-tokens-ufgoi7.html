                    The problem: With deteriorating health, seniors have many medical service needs but many other needs as well like social, personal services, financial etc. Medical services are provided by very well organized and regulated agencies. In addition, numerous charitable and volunteer organizations, families and individuals serve seniors requirements. These volunteer efforts are not fully organized. Volunteer efforts availability should be recorded, connected with patients who need them, incentivised to encourage increased participation, recognized and rewarded appropriately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution: An application, which will be accessed by various stakeholders of HOPE system, will provide an online repository of volunteer services, marketplace for consumption of these services by patients or service providers, account for the efforts rendered, provide schemes of incentives, calculate and reward the volunteers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solution Architecture: The solution will consist of a mobile app in HopeHealth app store integrated with HH cryptographic tokens and other platforms like ReliablyME.
