                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by my favorite video game of all time, Mother 3. A Japanese-only release, it included a brilliant mechanic where people can score extra points if they tap the "A" button in time with the background music. The name "Zombeat" is a play-on-words between "Zombie" and "Beat", which also was the name of one of the songs in the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zombeat aims to mimic this "interactive metronome" system and also adds new features that turn the program into a full-fledged music education tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote the program from scratch in Java using NetBeans and Eclipse. I used paint.NET for a handful of graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By the end of the project, some of my code became corrupt because I was switching between NetBeans and Eclipse. The game logic is in the code, however, it no longer plays when you start the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I designed and created the UI for this game in under 24 hours. As previously stated, the game logic is in the code. Even though the game is not playable, pretty much the core of the program is done and all it needs is to be linked together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I should have started with the game working before working on the UI.
                </p>
