                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thought it would be cool to use a single camera to plot an object in 3D using pixel based data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracks a ball in 2D to generate a 3D graph of it's position and history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using OpenCV for python and matplotlib for plotting the graphs in 3D.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing the task with threading in the time limit was difficult due to having only around 4 hours to complete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! Nice to have the visual response of seeing the position of the ball change in real time on a 3D image.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If this was to be done in a more performance oriented scenario it would be beneficial to complete in C++, allowing for direct access to memory locations and more advanced techniques.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Making it perform faster.
