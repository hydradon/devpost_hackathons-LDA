                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired after trying Google Cardboard for the first time to create an experience that played with how we see the world around us.  Our team is very musical and decided that sound plays a key role in our perception of the world; we decided to use that as the central motif for our game.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trapped note is a game where the player navigates a maze or puzzle using different lighting configurations matching different styles of music.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built on Unity for Google Cardboard as well as Oculus Rift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Porting the Unity application to Google Cardboard and Oculus Rift proved to be the most time consuming and difficult task so far.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the way our music integrates with our lighting system and the smooth game feel it delivers
