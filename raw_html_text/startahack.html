                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After having no idea what I wanted to work on because I never come with ideas to a hackathon I had an idea from a fellow. Why not make an idea generator? I went online to search for some but they are generally terrible to me. It's just arrays mixed to make some type of word-apocalypse. Rather than play with arrays until some idea makes sense I decided to break down in extreme detail what makes a person generate an idea. Then I just grabbed my laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a pure HTML/CSS that allows people to decide what they want to do in a hackathon. Using Maslow's hierarchy of needs, I based where people start first by 4 cores, then break it down to what they want, what they need, and where to start.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used glitch which I found on the Cruzhacks website. It pretty much is a CSS/HTML compiler
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest problem I ran into was design, I am mostly working on the front-end of the code. With that, I have no designer which is more work for me. Also, the idea of how detailed it needs to be is harder though.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doing most of the project all by myself with the help of a few people. Generally learning a lot at the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, the internship workshop is beautiful. Also, I learned a few things or two about CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Startahack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will continue working on it or export it to a C++ project so that it is easier for me to code. I will continue until I can't think of any more ideas on how to improve.
