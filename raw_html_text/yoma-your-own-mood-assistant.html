                    Depression is a state of mind where a person is not able to work at his full potential. Unnecessary thoughts start to pop up. Most of us have a relative would have experienced depression. And all that the person needs is someone to talk to. Obviously they can talk to their friends and family but they might not be available to talk all the time and also will not be able to provide professional help. And professional help is quite expensive to afford for some people. That is where YOMA comes into the picture. YOMA can be something to depend upon when you do not have people around to help.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an android app that has integrated Instagram API. This API lets you log on to Instagram helping YOMA get access to your Instagram photos to help you cherish memories when you need them. We also used the Google Vision API that reads those images and finds the expression associated with the image.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried implementing this app using Facebook API but Facebook API was not supportive in proving permissions to access the photos of the user.
Difficulty inserting data into MongoDB.
Since Node.js is asynchronous, the variable values were not being fetched.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create an app that can converse with the users to provide them moral support in the form of a conversation.
We could fetch photos from Instagram API and analyze them based on sentiments.

                    We learned to process the Language used by the user and respond accordingly using Aylien API for Natural Language Processing and sentiment analysis.
We also learned to use Google Vision to get the expressions of people in a picture.

                <p>
                    We are working on improving the Natural Language Processing to offer professional help. The instagram app can also be used to get locations from the places visited and offer suggestions to those places when you visit that area again.
