                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Platformers are a fun and simple yet challenging genre of game to make, so this was a good way to try out game concept and level design while learning C# and Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Goes through platforming levels of a tower climb, starting simple and getting progressively more challenging through progression with a grappling hook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Free graphic assets were found online, and scenes were created in Unity. Scripts for more complex actions like the grappling hook and teleporting the player character were coded in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a grappling hook with proper movement and visuals took a fair bit of effort to work correctly to pull the character toward the target.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a fully working game that is packaged and can be downloaded to play on any computer. This project was the first hackathon for the three of us and the first time for two of us using Unity, so it was great to have created a working platformer with minimal errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Unity and C# to make games and program scripts, adding 2D character animations, adding audio for the game, using scripts to add complex features.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more levels, building up on the concept and adding more complex levels and features.
