                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone wants the music at their party to make people get up a dance. We're here to make it happen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an compilation of Spotify and Echonest API's we search playlists and analyze their average danceability and  energy values. Then return whether or not your playlist is fit for your party.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the API and working with Android Studio took time and tested the patience levels of our group. Our group was also new to web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have implemented the API and have an actual phone app! We also had plenty of fun!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned html, and basic web development. We also learned how to implement API's with GET requests. Lastly, we learned to work with Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Can I Party?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to implement more statistics concerning playlists and make more apps for other platforms such as Apple and Windows. We would also like to look into creating an Android Wear app.
