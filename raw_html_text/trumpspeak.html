                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Trumps presidential campaign, we thought people would like to know a lot more about his policies, spoken from the man himself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ask Donald Trump questions about his life, and political views. Ask him questions about how he would solve issues like immigration reform, health care, the middle east and ISIS, economic reform and the middle class, and hear him respond (with the real life voice of Donald Trump) intelligently to your questions through quotes he has said in the past!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the Houndify API to efficiently analyze speech and convert it to text. Donald Trump audio clips were then taken off the internet and assigned topic tags of which to look for in speech. Once speech was cross-referenced with audio clips and their tags, a random response was taken of those which met the requirements of the topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Houndify API was built in Objective-C, which none of us had ever worked in before, so we ran into issues mixing the two languages in one project and quickly gaining a knowledge of the language and its syntax to be able to use the SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we overcame the issue of working in a new language and analyzing the user's speech for topics that they may have been referring to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to mix both Objective-C and Swift in one iOS project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TrumpSpeak
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TrumpSpeak will be expanded to include more topics and to more accurately zero-in on what the user is implying and the make-up of their sentence so that a better response can be formed.
