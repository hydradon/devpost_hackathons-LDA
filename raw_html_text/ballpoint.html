                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed ballpoint to fill a need for more structured productivity and concentration on text-editing apps like Google Docs.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enables users to set goals and create checklists that match the type of composition they hope to write.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ballpoint is deployed as a Chrome extension, and was built by interfacing with the Chrome API. We also isolated front-end from back-end for increased efficiency.
