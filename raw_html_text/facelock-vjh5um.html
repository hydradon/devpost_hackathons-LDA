                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was an idea we thought of because it was something that appealed to our ideas combine
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program can recognize a face to unlock passwords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used OpenCV and then modified it to record our images and unlock into a GUI so we can figure out our passwords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it work in general and we where able to compile everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combining python and c++ as well as configuring permissions so it works properly
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to combined Python and C++, as well combined different ideas for our final project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Face2Password
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we continue Face2Password we hope to clean it up and make it faster, as well as making the face recognition much more accurate.
