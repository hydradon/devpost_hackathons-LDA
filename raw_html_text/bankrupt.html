                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People go bankrupt all the time and we want to prevent that happening.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Predict if the users goes bankrupt or not by looking at the historical user data, using Gaussian distribution and calculating the standard deviations. If the user right now deviates too much from this Gaussian distribution the chance will be high that he/she will go bankrupt.

                <p>
                    Using react-native framework for front-end and using python combined with sci kit, numpy to predict these models.
