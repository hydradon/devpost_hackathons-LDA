                <p>
                    College Ride Sharing was inspired by the student-run Facebook group

                    To build the College Ride Sharing App, we used [node.js] and [Express] to create the backend. For the frontend of the app we used [HTML], [CSS], and [jQuery]. To create the database for all of the rides, we used [mongoDB].

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When first starting this web application, we were required to do extensive research on web development as the majority of our group members were new to this concept. During our web app development, we had difficulties sharing files with each other using [Github].
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After developing our web application, we are proud of learning how to use the different APIs to make our application run more smoothly as well as having one of our group members learn how backend works in the span of a day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From developing our web application, we learned how important collaboration and working as a team is in any design project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ride Sharing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope that we can implement more features to our web application such as pickup/dropoff locations, a mobile app, Facebook integration, profiles, better sorting methods, filtering old posts, adding seats to each ride post to see how many spots are available, and much more!
