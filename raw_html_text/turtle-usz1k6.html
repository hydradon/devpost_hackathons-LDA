                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    University is a stressful time in life. Many students struggle to form friendships between lectures, tutorials, and assignments. Turtle brings these students together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Turtle combats depression and loneliness by taking free time that users input and using user preferences and availability to automatically schedule events for users to meet up, make friends, and form lasting connections. Currently, Turtle is focusing on servicing university students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Turtle is written in the Swift programming language, using Xcode. The app is currently in an early prototype stage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most significant challenge we experienced was the difficulty of learning how to use Xcode to create a functional and beautiful interface using Swift, a language that none of the team has used before. While this was a significant struggle, this only amplified the satisfaction of completing the submission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that Turtle is a completely viable product in today's market. If this project is carried to completion, we believe that it can be profitable while continuing to have a strong positive impact on the mental health culture on university campuses.
