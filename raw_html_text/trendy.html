                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We met at the event - on the spot. We are a diverse team, from different parts of the world and different ages, with up to 7 years of difference! We believe that there is an important evolution towards using data technology to make investment decisions &amp; data applications to move to designing new financial products and services we have not even considered yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trendy analyzes over 300,000+ projects from Indiegogo, a crowd-funding website, for the last year. Trendy monitors and evaluates on average 20+ data points per company. Hence, we focus on 6 main variables and illustrate the use case based on statistical models. In order to keep the most user-friendly interface where we could still get as many info as possible, we have decided to create a chatbot on which the investor interacts with our platform.
The user may see graphs, trends analysis, and adjust his preferabilities accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have had a lot of trouble setting up the cloud to host everything. We also have had a lot of struggles in order to build a bot, due to many restrictions Facebook has set. The challenges kept us apart from innovating more on our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud to have a very acute data analysis and a great interface. Our results are logical and we seem to have one of the best interfaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about cloud hosting, data management, and chatbot setup. More concretely, we have built ourselves a great platform to facilitate our financial wealth plan!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trendy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We foresee adding a couple of predictive analytics concepts to our trend hacking platform, like random forests, Kelly criterion, and a couple of others. Moreover, we envisage empowering our database and analysis' accuracy by implementing some Machine Learning models.
