                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that the T-Mobile app and website, while offering a great user experience doesn't take advantage of the latest technology found in devices like Amazon Alexa. We find that Alexa can offer both functionality and a positive customer experience while staying true to T-Mobile's Un-Carrier campaign
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can view and pay your bill, check downtime services in your area, upgrade your services, and chat with your Team of Experts member.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Alexa sdk for Node.js and ran the services on AWS Lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we didn't have customer data available to us we had to load mock data to our program.
Also, we had to define every possible invocation when dealing with speech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have made it easy to access info about your T-Mobile plan. What would take minutes we have reduced down to seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the application of speech recognition in the production environment.
We also learned how to use AWS Lambda.

                <p>
                    We plan on adding more features to support t-mobile customers
