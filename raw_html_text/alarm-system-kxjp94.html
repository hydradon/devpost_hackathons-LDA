                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to incorporate the various sensors that were available within the hardware lab and thought that this was a practical and interesting way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It trips a buzzer and LEDs when the various sensors are activated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an FGPA board with Verilog and other various other sensors found in the hardware lab.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The software that works with the boards is often faulty, some of the wires were frayed, there is very little documentation on both verilog and the sensors that we were trying to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get the sensors to work individually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Various technicalities regarding verilog and interfacing with hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alarm System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll use it to protect a 3D printer in our school for our robotics club.
