                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last week our entire group was fighting over what movie we wanted to watch that weekend, and we only had the constraints of an hour and a half. The idea sprouted from necessity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project uses our advanced comparison algorithm to poll the user on their movie preferences. Preferences such as rating (G, PG, etc), genre(s), run-time, and era. It then looks through a database of movies from the IMDB top 250 movies of all time to compile a list of movies that the system believes are fit for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio and a Nexus emulator, we built the mainframe for a multi-page application and then created two separate java classes that calculated lists of movies and comparisons for each movie against another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted the database to be in a .txt file originally, but in the allotted time we were unable to figure out how Android Studios locates it's files and makes them open to read. Another challenge we had was accounting for if users input genres out of order, or left certain fields blank, the program became prone to crashing. We were able that out however after a long-winded flow chart of logic statements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prior to this hackathon, no member had any prior experience with making any form of mobile application. We were able to get an application working with a splash screen, multiple types of buttons/text fields, and a RecyclerView to display a list of movies with our custom format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned the basics of using Android Studio and how XML and Java can work together to create a powerful program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Movie Reco
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding a personalized watchlist for each user when they run the program and pinging data from an online database as opposed to a hard-copy text file list.
