                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On a fine fruitful Friday with ideas brewing in our brains, we got the idea for betyouwont from a co-worker. We thought people would enjoy gamifying and crowd sourcing daring things for people to do with the ultimate incentive of gaining a little cash.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People can fund ideas for people to do and people can claim challenges with dollar values on them. Once they claim the task, they perform it and get the cash. We would get validation from the users and we have moderators viewing videos of whether the event actually happened or whether it was bogus and cash out the user who claimed it accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using Ruby on Rails and ReactJS as our front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never done ReactJS before this weekend and it took SO INCREDIBLE long to figure out how to use it. Our team members had primarily back end experience with knowledge in only certain frameworks, ReactJS not being one of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're happy to see we figured out several use cases and design practices for ReactJS and we're embracing its new philosophy when creating web apps. We're still messing around with it but it was a big hurdle to jump over.
                </p>
