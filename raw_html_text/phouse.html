                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3Dconnexion SpaceMouse Pro Wireless - 3D mouse, but who wants to pay 300 dollars for such a mouse? Phouse (Phone mouse) is a lightweight alternative that gives users a unique mousing experience for free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The phouse connects to a computer over Wi-Fi as a mouse. What separates this from many of the other Android mouses currently out there is the usage of the accelerometer integrated into Android devices as a form of mouse movement. This offers advantages over normal mouses and track pads by allowing for intuitive movement, not requiring a cable or adapter, and not requiring table space. It also provides clicking functionality and has potential to include keyboard inputs in the future. This hack also includes a 3D printed mount for the phone to give the user the same usability as expensive options such as the SpaceMouse.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Programmed in Android Studio, Eclipse, and a smartphone.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the sockets/server/client caused a couple issues, especially since I ended up making it mostly a one-way connection. Furthermore, the use of a 3D printer made it difficult to allow the mount's ball joint to have free, accurate movement.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a pretty cool idea and really the first time I have used Android applications for anything beyond a really basic app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For me, it was an exploration into the realm of User Experience and Human-Computer Interaction. I definitely had a lot of fun implementing it and picked up some practical Android/Java knowledge at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Phouse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Phouse could benefit from more features such as keyboard macros/mappings and additional screens. Also, the implementation of secondary sensors, mouse acceleration, and a high-pass filter could allow for smoother and more accurate movement.
