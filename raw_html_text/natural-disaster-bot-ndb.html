                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the recent recurring events of natural disasters such as the Manghut Typhoon and wildfires in california, we decided to contribute to the rescue missions with machine learning.

                    <li>
                        By using chatbot as an interface, it collects critical informations from the users and assist them with suggestions.

                    <li>
                        We use Kmean Clustering algorithm to find multiple optimized coordinates to send mass transportation vehicles and visualizes it on an admin dashboard.

                    <li>
                        The users can also query for the recent weather to check if there is going to be an alerts.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a chat bot using reactjs and google cloud platform - natural language and used accuweather APIs to get weather data and alarms. We store the data on sqlite3 with a backend server running ruby on rails and nodejs. Machine learning model, Kmean Clustering algorithm, is built with sklearn in python.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some issues integrating the various systems. Making the UI simple on the frontend with complex data analysis, processing and communicating with various platforms on the backend was very challenging.
                </p>
