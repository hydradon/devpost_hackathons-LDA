                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired by Fortnite and all the epic battle royal games. We are also inspired by former jagex CEO Mark Gerhard's tank... And Batman.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This epic 24 hour masterpiece is a culmination of everything amazing in the gaming industry such as violence, tanks and explosive destruction. 
This project includes a registration and login system and incorporates user accounts to store highscores. It also has an online multiplayer mode in which you can battle eachother. Please note you will need to have 2 people on the multiplayer page for it to begin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end of this project using HTML and CSS. The game itself is coded entirely in javascript with the server for multiplayer being made in node.js. There is then a backend system for user accounts and highscores which is coded in php.
                </p>
