                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Amazon Sumerian, I created most of the assets and used various state machines to create the feeling of a blimp experience.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While Amazon Sumerian has very simple VR integrations, there were many problems with using rigidbody and collider based objects. As a result, I had to scrap two other projects prior to this. There were certain limitations I had to work with too, such as size limitations, incompatible file types for 3D models, and constant lag spikes. I contacted support, but because of timezones I was not able to communicate with them well, and it didn't prove to be helpful to me in the long run. But alas, I was able to make things work after lots of testing and trying things out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the ideas had to be compromised to something simpler; instead of moving the blimp, I moved the sky instead. Instead of making the player grab the controls and tilt them (it was a limitation in the software), I made it use buttons instead. They are not the most elegant of solutions, but I am happy they worked out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon Sumerian can be potentially powerful; but it just hasn't reached that stage yet for more technical uses. (Here's to hoping that in due time, it becomes far better.) But in learning that, I taught myself about achieving what I perceived using certain techniques and cheats.
