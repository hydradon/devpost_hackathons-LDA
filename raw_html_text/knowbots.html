                <p>
                    Knowledge can come from anywhere - classrooms, books and articles. But most times, when we are in a rhythm at work, wouldn't it be super useful to just ping an expert?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plus, not all knowledge-work is equal - there're apps for buying things, or finding tickets to places. Google is great at feeding curiosity, but goal-driven knowledge is a different game. Situations like interview-prep, sales meetings, project introductions, launching startups, professional development and research can be time sensitive. You almost need a friend to help out with wiping out the noise.

                    When you're done, KnowBot intelligently creates a personalized "Springboard Kit", just for you.
                    <em>
                        Today, this kit is available as an easy-to-read packet of relevant articles and expert advice from Mya's design corpus, curated in a pretty-to-see and print-ready magazine.
                    </em>
                    Scan all relevant knowledge on your phone, or print it and take it to-go!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three big, but super fun, steps:
1.) Relevance - this is where using Mya's capabilities to find relevant knowledge really helped us boost the basic premise.
2.) Contextual training the bot - KnowBot is powered by a large pool of real-life training data - a highly curated map of knowledge intents from over 150,000 real-person situations in Mya (
                    <a href="http://myalearning.com" rel="nofollow">
                        http://myalearning.com
                    </a>
                    ). So what? The bot can distinguish nuances in intent and context like "I'm moving to Pittsburgh" v/s "I'm meeting with people from Pittsburgh".
3.) "Lego" the cognitive - We've chained a sleuth of in-house AI modules (thinkCOCO prediction and machine learning models) and a number of IBM Watson APIs (Dialog, NLC, Speech-to-Text, AlchemyLanguage, AlchemyData, Document Conversion).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    IBM Watson APIs used

                    Dialog: for basic conversation routing (training mode)
NLC: for training intents from Mya's 150K+ real-life situations.

                        Simplicity is key: conversational UX has an inherent challenge to simplify without losing the human element. It was fun and also great learning to make the Bot smart enough to bridge around like a person.

                    <li>
                        Think Platform: KnowBot is fetching public domain knowledge, as well as allows experts to 'plug-in' their expertise. The vision is now near where I could follow my dad, my mentor and key brand-experts - and let KnowBot figure out what's relevant, when and in what capacity.

                        Chaining Watson APIs: chaining APIs from a cognitive ecosystem was key to a 'wow' reaction.
