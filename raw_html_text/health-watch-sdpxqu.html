                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Eric's home country of El Salvador, his family has to keep close track of their medical records because the clinics they go to have different versions of their records. This is especially important for his grandmother, who has a heart condition. Eric's family are not the only ones who have inconsistent medical records, but also the millions who live in rural areas.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Health Watch is just a cheap, durable watch, but with accessible storage that can store a user's health records and care reports.  Health professionals can access the user's health records and add care reports using the mobile app or computer software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This most difficult part for us was the hardware design aspect of this project.  Because we lacked the resources and expertise to conceptualize a polished prototype, we decided to create a CAD model of what we envision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're especially proud of how much we've learned about CAD.  But we've made progress with our idea and the CAD model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CAD and hardware design, in general, were our greatest learning strides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Health Watch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After polishing the prototype, we plan on presenting it to potential investors. If we gain enough capital, we will manufacture and distribute the first-generation line of Health Watch watches to specific populations.
