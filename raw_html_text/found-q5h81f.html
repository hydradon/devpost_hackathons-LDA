                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all saddened when learning how many dogs are left strayed on the roads, we wanted to find a way to change this and in turn  make our world a better place.

                <p>
                    I&rsquo;ve lost a pet:
Import photo of pet
answer questionnaire on physical characteristics
Provide contact info (email, phone number)
Scroll through &ldquo;found&rdquo; pets or &ldquo;last seen&rdquo; pets that match (or loosely match) your answers
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;ve found a pet:
Identify if stray is in danger, or dangerous to people (foaming [rabies], leg hurt)
Take picture of pet through app
Submit approx. height and length of stray
App sends photo and information to three nearest animal shelters through text, if urgent provides phone numbers to call (and shelters to pick up wounded or dangerous animal)
Complete que\stionnaire on physical characteristics
Make &ldquo;profile&rdquo; for stray, last seen, etc. and can see owners that have lost similar dogs and contact info if they see a match
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m an animal shelter employee
Include Photo of new pet received
Answered questionnaire about physical characteristics
Provide location 
Scroll through &ldquo;found pets&rdquo; or &ldquo;last seen&rdquo; pets that match (or loosely match) your answers
