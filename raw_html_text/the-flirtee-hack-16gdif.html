                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to incorporate the hardware aspect instead of merely focusing on the software aspect of a project. After getting inspiration from an article speaking of an Arduino based vending machine, we decided to try to incorporate the same logic. However, instead of just merely dropping out candy, we wanted the box to have its own personal flare as it accompanies each candy bar with a cute pickup line that can definitely make some people smile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives out candy but also prints out a cute and funny message on the LCD screen with the intention to entertain and be funny.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using two stepper motors, an Arduino mega, an LCD screen and a keypad, we programmed it to fulfill its purpose. We built the box itself from scratch using recycled cardboard boxes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The physics involved with how we were to allow the candy bar to drop without exerting too much pressure on our relatively weak motors was more complicated to implement since having to create the whole box from a few pieces of cardboard. We had a malfunctioning motor driver which ended up being defective from the very beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we are able to actually finish the project in the first place given the short period of time. As well as how quick it took us to learn about the components used since we have never used these components before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To plan ahead when it comes to projects like these no matter how easy it may seem at first. We learned how to implement and LCD screen using an arduino as well as understand how stepper motors work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for the flirtEE hack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to implement more features that involve a more complex motor system as well as create a more complicated yet interactive setup in which the keypad is utilized more.
