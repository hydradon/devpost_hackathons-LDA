                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having to register over and over for many events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows bookings for lodgings and events to be made online, and checks the users face against their profile photo when they arrive at the destination to check in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Node.js and AWS Rekognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The learning curve for the AWS services was likely the most difficult portion of this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming together as a team to tackle different aspects of this challenge. Several of us used unfamiliar technologies for their assigned portions of the system, and learned a lot through this experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement Amazon Web Services, web front-end using the Bootstrap framework, and some basic Kotlin.
                </p>

                    What's next for TravelCon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding features such as registration timeout (checkout times), so that access is revoked after the event.
