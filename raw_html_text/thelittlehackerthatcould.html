                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the strong, leading women that are helping to run the Pearl Hacks event today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program runs on the console and will display important dialogue that reveals the little girl's character depending on the choices you make for her. You play as her conscience and are in charge of making sure that the little girl stays determined throughout her day. There are currently two endings depending on your choices and how they affect her encouragement meter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used netbeans to build this program in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to being beginner programmers, we were limited by our knowledge. After reading a ton of documentations and APIs, we settled for a simplistic file that can run. If we had more time, we would have made a point system so that the little girl could get at least 3 different endings based on number of points, which increases and decreases throughout the story depending on your choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote many, many lines of code to make this short story happen. We also figured out how to delay text. Most of all, we are proud of the story that we have crafted. We think it relates to a lot of girls, including ourselves. We hope that we can use this story as a hopeful example of ourselves as we also navigate our way into the tech industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we can make games, and express ourselves even if we do not know much code. As long as there is a will, there's a way, right? In addition, we found out that we can bring awareness to issues even on a basic level. A little, brute determination to finish a project is better than nothing at all. Furthermore, we learned that writing a story and creating a relatable character is a lot harder than we though. On the more technical side, we learned how to use GitHub!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TheLittleHackerThatCould
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we can create more meaningful stories and turn them into visual novels or text-based adventures. Next time, we will develop a more efficient way to create the code, so we can concentrate more on plot instead of limiting the depth in our story rather than on how much work we have to do on the code. We admit, if you look at our code, it is rather inefficient and redundant. We believe, however, that what really matters is that people are able to take-away something from our story, and we will always improve as long as we don't give- quite like the little girl in our story. We want to implement an actual UX Import to iOS to implement the push notification style of gameplay, music, more choices, and more endings. The possibilities are endless
