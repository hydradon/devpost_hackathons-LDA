                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting robbed and losing our wallets on the way to this Hackathon has been very frustrating. We had to cancel and replace numerous credit cards and pay agencies to replace lost identification cards, and we still carry the risk of identification theft and other security risks. With NoCard, this no longer is the case.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NoCard stores all your credit card and identification card information on a blockchain and ties it to your finger print and password so that only you have access to it. Now when you want to make a payment or unlock a door, you can open the app and authorize the payment. Permissions can be granted to allow people access to buildings or infrastructure even while the owner is not present.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a blockchain by using Python libraries such as bcrypt and hashlib to store all the sensitive information that is given by the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are constantly learning new things about blockchain technology and how to implement features. Blockchain technology is very complex and still relatively new, so finding resources to get a complete grasp on the concept and implementing an actual blockchain proved difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to understand certain parts of blockchain technology and begin to map out how the decentralized application will take form. The concept of the application that we are working on is an active area of research; we wanted to work on an application that had not been completely and successfully implemented in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blockchain technology is incredibly powerful and has the potential to reshape the technology landscape as we know it. We are already seeing this take shape with the growing trust in Cryptocurrencies like BitCoin, Ethereum, and LiteCoin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NoCard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NoCard lays the foundation for complete identity management and protection, having the potential to reduce or do away with the need for identification cards. We hope that the core feature of identity protection is kept and furthered.
                </p>
