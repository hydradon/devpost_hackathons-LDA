                    We wanted to create a project that was both useful and creative. This resulted in some experimentation and we ended up with Markov Twitter!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project has you select from 14 different people (all famous) and let you create your own tweets based on their speech patterns and a Markov chain. You can also view the timeline of all tweets that have been made and see your own saved tweets!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose this project as it seemed like a good learning experience as well as a good project to show off to the people!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What was the hardest part?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding the Markov Chain was the hardest part as it was really buggy at first and sorta just broke everything, but thankfully we were able to make it work and be presentable.
                </p>

                    Thank you for checking out Markov Twitter!
