                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every day people spend hours crossing the border from Mexico to the United States, San Ysidro being one of the busiest border crossing in the world, people depend on planning ahead their route so that they can to work on time. 
The  Problem is that most of the platforms that offer the estimated time for border crossing also depend on ads placements and in the case of Facebook or Whatsapp groups there is a lot of unrelated content going around that it takes a lot of time to find the information you are looking for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a bot that gives you the border crossing time right inside messenger, that way we eliminate the barrier for users of having to download an app, saving them time and memory space, besides its easier for adoption as the user already is interacting with the platform most of his time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our algorithm automatically search on the internet the different cross-border information  and also parse data from 
 Facebook groups twitter and related border source. Also, we implemented some dialog features to make it more user-friendly

                    The curation of content that we extracted from the other platforms in order to show only the related with waiting times, the ideation of conversational features in order to make it more human like

                    Helping people from Mexico and the United States get their border crossing information quickly so that they can organize their time better.

                <p>
                    We are going to implement the same algorithm to fetch the crossing border time and the lines in all Canada, US and Mexico border.
