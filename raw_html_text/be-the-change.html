                    "Be the change that you wish to see in the world" is a quote often attributed to Mahatma Gandhi that embodies our personal responsiblity to try to make the world a better place to live.  This skill makes it easier for people to improve their communities by giving ideas on ways to give back.  This could be as simple as volunteering for a local charity or as time consuming as raising a service dog.
