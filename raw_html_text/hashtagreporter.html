                    I've been preoccupied with local news reporting and have tried creating projects that haven't worked before. 
Last year I created a hashtag system that would make it easy for reporters to tag their tweets and for others to find them. I called it #hashtagreporter and... I have about 10 followers on twitter. I'm thinking that with video this might work better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is how it works:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sign up for an account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at existing trending hashtags or add new ones. Record and upload a question, a comment or live footage from the scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at other reporter's reports and leave video comments to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You give the site permission to show the material. There is also an option for broadcasters to contact you and acquire the footage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can create a channel that people can subscribe to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several possibilities. One is to invite experts to video chats to reply to some of the questions posted. Another idea would be to cooperate with a news network and create a weekly citizen journalist news show based on hashtag reporter's submissions.

                    Challenges I ran into:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time and brainpower. I can do basic websites and I usually copy and paste when I do stuff. That worked well with Ziggeo to a point but to move further I will need some time to tackle it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I learned:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well I'm learning to use Ziggeo. I'd like to learn some of the other API's too but being how slow I am I didn't feel that I would be able to do it today. Instead I focused on tackling basics with Ziggeo.

                    What's next for #HashtagReporter:
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'll develop it as far as I can and then I'll ask someone else if they want it. I just want a project like this to exist. I'm the news junkie user.
