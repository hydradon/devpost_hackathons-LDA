                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over 60% of Americans have less than $1000 in their savings account and thought of making a project that could allow people to understand that investing can be easy, powerful, and convenient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code is meant to take in banking information of an individual using the Capital One API and calculate the opportunity cost for different types of investment strategies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The algorithm was solely built on PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very difficult to develop the algorithm along with integrating the API to work with PHP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very happy that it was able to work at all considering the complexity of the code and our lack of experience with API use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to integrate the Capital One API with PHP as well as develop a cost model for compounding interest with reinvested gains.
                </p>
