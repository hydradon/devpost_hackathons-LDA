                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I never felt safe using digital or online password managers like last pass because something about having your entire digital life stored in some server didn't feel right. A simple executable or malware could give an attacker access to all of your accounts. Rather than attempting to stop attacks with extreme encryption and multi factor authentication, I decided to stop it at its source by storing accounts completely offline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Hardware Password Manager works by having an Arduino Pro Micro attached to a display, SD card adapter, buttons, and a NodeMCU ESP82666. It will read the credentials from the SD card, put them in a menu, then let the user choose what they are trying to login to. The NodeMCU is powered by the Arduino and is connected via serial ports. It hosts a web interface in its own wireless network. The user can use a mobile phone to interact with the hardware password manager wirelessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used previous knowledge from Arduino with lots of trial and error to get the result I have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the Arduino is programmed in c, I had a really hard time doing things like converting data types, splitting strings, and other operations. I spent several hours writing my own functions and bug testing them to make sure they wouldn't fail.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I gained much more experience with Arduinos so I could better plan and manage any future hardware projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hardware Password Manager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will be releasing the source code to my GitHub once I clean it up a bit.
Some things that may or may not happen in the future:
-Encryption (only thing stopping me as of now is finding a good library)
-OLED display
-Better web interface
-PCBs being ordered making it much more practical.
