                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The JBL Pulse two is an amazing device, great sound. But the lights on the Pulse are pretty much unrelated to the type of music that's getting played. This makes little sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we want to make visualizations on the PULSE which will be related to the audio that's being played.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    However incomplete, our app reads the type of audio which is being played and based on analyzing the loudness, frequency spectrum and relevant parameters of the audio it fills up the screen with amazing visualizations. Our aim is also to relate color with sound, so lets say there's some soft music playing, the color would be different for it compared to some other genre.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We immersed ourselves into the harman kardon sdk PULSE sdk, imported it into Android Studio. The first thing we did was we went through the documentation of the SDK and got ourselves started. The demo app is not very simple and understandable so found some trouble, but the SDK documentation is good. Now that we learned the SDK we started playing around with individual LEDs on the Pulse and also make some patterns. Then we tried changing the ColorBitmaps over a period of time so that we have something of a visualization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also looked how to capture the output audio stream in an android device and how to analyze the audio for the parameters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are right now making functions that can be used by us and other developers to make better art on the PULSE.

                    Based on the weather outside we will have similar visualizations on the PULSE.
