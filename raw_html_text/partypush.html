                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At our weekly Friday night hangout, we continued to pass around a single phone to queue up songs, and the idea of people pushing song requests from their individual phones emerged. This quickly expanded to food and drink requests in a party context and we realized an app would benefit both guests and hosts of a party.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows guests to send immediate feedback on food/drink levels and song requests to hosts. This helps guests enjoy the party more freely and makes it easier for hosts to do their job while still joining the party themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Firebase for the back end to create an API and wrote helper functions to pull data from there. We then merged this with our front end to display this data, which was created with Angular 8. Our website is scalable for all devices which enhances the experience for mobile users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly bugs in the back end - many YouTube tutorials were needed to get it right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All but one of us had zero experience with Firebase, so learning as we went was imperative. We also learned that building a web app was much more difficult than initially thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PartyPush
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transportation - we want to include a feature to match people wanting to split an Uber/Lyft or simply walk home together and who are going to nearby locations. This will reduce transportation costs and advocate for safety in numbers.
