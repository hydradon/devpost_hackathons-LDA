                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technology has an odd way of becoming a novelty.  Nasa's pens for use in zero gravity can be bought in souvenir shops by people who will never feel zero gravity.  The military developed an advanced form of real-time tracking via satellites, and that can now be used to hide treasures for others to find.  The greatest revolution in mobile computing is often used as a fashion accessory.  So we decided to take modern advancements in image and language processing and noveltize it as well.  Introducing: Verbosify!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a phrase and correlated image, and parses the phrase into more sophisticated language, while at the same time reducing the quality of the image in accordance.  The end result can be saved for historical reference

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used PHP for presentation and image processing and Google Cloud for language parsing.
