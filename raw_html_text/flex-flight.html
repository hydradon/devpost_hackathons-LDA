                    A Virtual Reality game in which you fly through space battling Tie Fighters. We will attach flex sensors to a glove, four in total with one on each index finger and one on each middle finger. Connecting this to the Arduino, we can then grab data that lets us know when you are bending your finger. Based on this information, your left hand controls the movement of your ship, while your right hand allows you to shoot.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To start, we attached the flex sensors to our gloves' middle and index fingers. Those flex sensors were then attached to a breadboard, which was attached to our arduino. The arduino was then attached to our laptop, which then took in the data from the arduino as a voltage emitted by each of the flex sensors. Using this data and putting on certain ranges, we could determine whether the sensor was bent or not. From here, that data was then imported into our C# code from Unity. As this was happening, we also developed a basic outline for the Virtual Reality game.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is a very software experienced group. The three of us have all done some web development, but none of us were really familiar with any form of hardware, especially not the arduino. This presented a lot of problems as we spent most of the hackathon trying to figure out exactly how everything worked and what we could do. Our original idea had to be scrapped due to getting the wrong hardware. In addition, after setting up the arduino we had a a lot of trouble figuring out how to get it to work with Unity and just barely managed to figure that out.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're pretty proud that we managed to get the arduino to work at all, even though it didn't all go quite as planned. We also learned a tremendous amount.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If nothing else this hackathon was definitely a learning experience. Not only did we all learn how to work with breadboards, circuits, and the arduino, but we even learned a lot about the capabilities of the various pieces of hardware that we didn't manage to get. After this hackathon, working with hardware doesn't seem quite as scary, and we're all excited to keep going.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Flex Flight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is not currently working as we hoped it would, but we do know how to get both the arduino and virtual reality working as two separate entities. We definitely want to keep working at some point to figure out how to get it all as one working project.
