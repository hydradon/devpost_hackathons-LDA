                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our members have musical backgrounds, so we decided to do something related to instruments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Play drums, piano, and other sound effects. It can also record musical sequences, change the tempo, and replay the recorded sequence in a loop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the visual for our program on PhotoShop and then programmed everything using Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out how to use Array Lists and it was also difficult to find out how to make tempo changes and looping for recordings (using elapsed time to keep the same rhythm).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the playback option in our program and the visual component.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used github, for example we learned how to pull and push information from a server. Also we learned more about Java and PhotoShop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VIRTuoso
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add a feature where you can switch the keyboard to different sounds, like a violin, clarinet or other instruments. It would also be cool to layer different recordings to create harmonies.
