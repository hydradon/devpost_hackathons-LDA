                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to spend some time learning iOS. We all had a little bit of knowledge from just playing with xcode but we never fully developed a project on it. However the main inspiration came from the idea of growing up in the technological revolution. We can all agree that technology, especially smartphones, has hindered many individuals abilities to interact in person. We attempted to implement this application with basic social media application functionality. Our hopes is that with our application, it will be enough of an incentive to get people to have more in person interaction in this modern day of technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is like any other social media app. You meet people and you become friends with them, just like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, etc. However, our condition for being able to friend someone is to take a selfie together with them. Ideally, this would be useful for big events, such as musical festivals, conferences, or HackTech 2017. Anyone else with the app will show up as a dot on the map and you can look for these individuals at this event and interact with them.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the backend using google app engine using python scripts. We built the front end on Xcode using swift 3.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was learning how to code in swift and developing a working application in the time frame given.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to learn as much swift as we can in the allotted time. It was a great learning experience, but there is still much more to learn in terms of mobile application development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a better sense of coding in swift. We also learned how to use google app engine as the backend.
