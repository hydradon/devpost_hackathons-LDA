                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the American Humane Association around 10 million dogs and cats are lost and stolen each year. Only around 22 percent of these dogs, who are found and taken to the shelter, are reunited with their families while only 2 percent of cats are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you have lost your pet it can feel hopeless and navigating the many places to report them can be overwhelming. The idea behind this project was to create a one stop way to report a lost or found pet that would search local areas and post to social media and other sites for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the moment it allows users to access our webpage to report a lost or found pet at the following location:
                    <a href="http://www.squeakcode.com/pawsandfound/" rel="nofollow">
                        http://www.squeakcode.com/pawsandfound/
                    </a>
                    . Depending on their selection, they are directed to the next page (lost pet page or found pet page) where they can fill out a form and submit their information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and bootstrap to design the webpage. To host the webpage, we used AWS. Additionally, we used Google Cloud database to store the information provided by the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted this to be an App, but due to the internet not working, we were not able to download the required Android packages and resources. Additionally, we had had not worked with with Google Cloud so, we spent some time learning how to use Google Cloud services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create something after all the technical initial issues that we faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the members learned how to create a database, while others explored the various tools of webpage development. And while the project did not become an app, we explored Android Studio, which can be used in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Paws and Found
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our project to be fully functional, we need to complete the following tasks:
-Take user input and store it in the Google Cloud database.
-Allow users to upload photos and store them in the database.
-Use Cloud Vision API to compare newly uploaded images to those stored in the database.
-Create a gallery page that allow the users to view pictures of all the pictures stored in the database.
-If a match is found in the database, generate a message to contact the person who posted the picture. 
-Once the pet has found and claimed by the rightful owner, remove the picture from the database and remove the post.
