                <p>
                    Ethical security researchers are vital for keeping the Internet safe, so companies often incentivize them with rewards if they report security issues responsibly, instead of exploiting them for malicious purposes. However, bug bounty programs are difficult to run, so many companies outsource to third parties such as HackerOne. This increases the number of people who are exposed to unpatched bugs and hacking tools, and can increase the chances that they will be stolen and used for nefarious purposes. Furthermore, security researchers have
                    <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/dji-left-private-keys-for-ssl-cloud-storage-in-public-view-and-exposed-customers/" rel="nofollow">
                        received legal threats
                    </a>
                    for "hacking" a company even when following the company's bug bounty rules, resulting in a loss of trust in bug bounty programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, there's a need for a bug bounty system that:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Is easy to run for companies

                    <li>
                        Is trustworthy for researchers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And is secure (and optionally anonymous) for both parties
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to apply the Ethereum blockchain's smart contracts to this problem: it automates financial transactions, which saves time for companies, and can encode a bug bounty's rules in unambigious code that everyone can inspect, which allows reseachers to be certain that they would be rewarded instead of punished for their heroic work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our current smart contract allows a company to specify an URL of a website and a given output that would only appear if the site is vulnerable. (For example, an error message that should never be shown in normal operation, or a successful login message for a nonexistent user). Then, researchers can submit data to the contract, which will observe the site's response to this data. If the output matches the vulnerable output, then the researcher has demonstrated that the software is vulnerable, and the contract will automatically award the researcher with the bounty in Ethereum.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>

                    We used the
                    <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow">
                        Solidity
                    </a>
                    language to develop the contract. We used the
                    <a href="http://docs.oraclize.it/#diams--ethereum" rel="nofollow">
                        Oraclize
                    </a>
                    API to provide a cryptographically secure and distributed method to submit and receive data from the software being tested. We used the
                    <a href="http://truffleframework.com/" rel="nofollow">
                        Truffle
                    </a>
                    framework to compile and deploy our contract, the
                    <a href="https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc" rel="nofollow">
                        TestRPC
                    </a>
                    simulator to create a local Ethereum blockchain for testing, and finally we used
                    <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API" rel="nofollow">
                        Web3.js
                    </a>
                    to create a web-based user interface for researchers to submit their data for the bounty program. Throughout the project, we followed rules for secure development by examining best practices for smart contracts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we decided to test the feasibility of automated bug bounties by intentionally building a simple vulnerable application using Python, Flask, and SQLite to demonstrate that a bounty for a SQL injection vulnerability can be awarded automatically. Even here, we considered security by isolating this program on a Heroku account with no access to other resources.

                    <li>
                        Setting up a private Ethereum blockchain for local testing proved to be difficult, with jargon-filled guides that aren't targeted at blockchain newbies

                    <li>
                        Smart Contracts are still not very mature: we had to carefully avoid edge cases in Solidity that would introduce vulnerabilities
