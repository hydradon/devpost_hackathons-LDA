                    Social content sharing platform where users will be able to view the other users post in our gallery area. There is scratch pad where the user could edit their content and interact with emoji's. I made it as user-friendly as possible.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had 1 week to build this app from scratch. Though some functionality are not achieved due to time constraints. I used java , servlets  3.0 , jsp , jstl , maven, jquery , javascript , external jquery plugins to show contents and used stackoverflow for code guide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating okta to the application was a challenge. I had very limited time but the documentation was good but would need more time for perfect end to end integration of the user sessions. 
The scratch pad design was challenging.

                <p>
                    the app functionality works as expected. Would be able to deliver more if given more timeframe though i started very late had just 1 week to complete.
