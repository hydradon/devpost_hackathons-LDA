                <p>
                    Honey I'm Home combines facial recognition technologies, with home automation software to introduce the next generation of the smart household. It allows a homeowner to set trusted users into their "household". Once a user is inside a family unit, and has uploaded sufficient amount of images to build their facial scan, a camera scans their face every time they walk inside their house. Whether playing a favorite song or protecting a family from intruders - Honey I'm Home uses state of the art technology to combine security and convenience.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used node/express/mongoDB for the backend, along with jade/materialize on the frontend. We utilized Python &amp;&amp; openCV for the image processing client, and google text to speech for the greetings.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some issues at first with Jade, openCV in nodejs, and sending images over http.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully were able to get facial recognition for a home security and convenience system in less than 24 hours.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to combine node with openCV in order to complete a face recognition algorithm. We also experimented successfully with Jade.

                <p>
                    Honey I'm Home will combine other internet of things features, such as adjusting a thermostat, heating a cup of coffee, building a TV schedule, and narrating other important alerts such as appointments.
