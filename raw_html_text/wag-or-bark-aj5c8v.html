Basic Functionality
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wag or Bark is a web based application that will also be a future mobile app.
It finds the perfect dog for you based on your search parameters and location.
Uses user created content of video clips, pictures, and bios into the dog&rsquo;s history and specs about your new best friends personality.
A database integration that uses analytics to cater to the user&rsquo;s preferences.

                    Mission Statement
Every year 8 million dogs and cats enter shelters across the U.S in which nearly 50% don&rsquo;t make it out alive. Our Mission Statement at Wag or Bark is to help users find their perfect four legged friends so that no dog goes unadopted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our application is simple
                </p>
                <p>
                    By putting the needs of our users first we have streamlined a process to make searching for the next addition to their family to benefit both the dogs and the adoption centers.

                <p>
                    Aesthetics
                </p>
                <p>
                    The application has an inviting background of a park. The center of the site and where the user will use most of our functionality is with our paw print. The very left print is used to iterate through the choices our users will have with the dogs available for adoption. The top two paws are there for only aesthetic reasons currently but may be used in the future for other features. The right paw is used to match our users with their possible new family member. The bottom paw is used to display the images of the dogs available.
