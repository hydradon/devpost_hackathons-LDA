                    <em>
                        Often times, when we shower, the deepest thought-provoking questions come to our mind.
                    </em>
                    Why wait until shower time to be deeply fascinated by eye-opening thoughts? We decided to create an Alexa skill that tells you a
                    <strong>
                        shower thought
                    </strong>
                    upon command.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Alexa skill allows the user to ask Alexa for a shower thought. For example, a user may activate the skill by saying, "Alexa, open Shower Thoughts" and then saying, "tell me a shower thought". Alexa then responds with a shower thought that is randomly chosen from a Reddit "Shower Thought" forum.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa skill was built with node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we wanted to create an Amazon Alexa Priority Task Skill that would ask Alexa to remind the user of their daily tasks. The Alexa would more frequently remind the user of a task depending on its priority level (low, medium and high). The reason we were not able to finish that particular skill was due to having trouble on finding out how to store information from the user.

                <p>
                    Learning how to navigate the AWS and how to create a Lambda function for the back-end development. Completing the skills and getting it to function properly.

                <p>
                    Adding a feature where a user can add their own shower thought to the list which will then be automatically posted to the Reddit "Shower Thoughts" forum.
