                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind this project was to be able to see what other people thought about an event that happened or is happening in order to see what is worth seeing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It utilizes Twitter data from the date of an event and runs it through IBM Watson to see what people's unbiased thoughts were of a particular event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ticketmaster's API in order to find events in certain cities. We then accessed Twitter's API to gather data on what people thought of an event. After gathering that data, we send it through IBM Watson to analyze their emotions of the event. That is then displayed along with tweets of the event as well as info on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into include trying to get all of the APIs to work together in order to create a functioning web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are incredibly happy that we were able to create a functioning prototype of this web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work as a team in order to reach certain goals. We also learned to let go of goals that were out of our reach.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CrowdVibe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to utilize a graph in order to show the emotions of people more clearly. Also, we would like to access festival data so we can create a heat map of the best shows going on at any particular time. This would help people discover new bands and give more incentives for the artists to put on their best possible show.
