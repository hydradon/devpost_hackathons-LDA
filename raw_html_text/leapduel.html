                    Most of us didn't sleep.

                    That's ok though. We built an awesome throw-back to Yugioh using the LeapMotion Controller, a modern twist on a retro piece of nostalgia we all remembered from our childhoods.

                        The game controls are simple:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        'Tap' as if on a keyboard to add a card from the deck to the hand.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        'Swipe up' on a card to add it to the Playing Field.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        'Jab at the screen' to change a monsters battle position, or flip a spell or trap card.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        'Tap' on cards in the field to send them to the Graveyard.

                    We hacked through the night, at first expecting to incorporate Oculus Rift into an Immersive 3D real-time Card Game using the Leap Motion controller and it's advanced bone tracking. After hours of playing with both Leap Motion and Oculus' Libraries, we decided against hacking together a 3D application in the time we had, and instead spent our time creating the card game using just Leap Motion's Libraries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hacked together the graphics using OpenGL, SDL2, and SDL2_image. We interpret Gestures captured by Leap Motion in order to direct the game according to the Players hand-motions, almost like a real card game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to add networking using SDL2_net for a true Two-Player experience, add soundtracks, notifications for other player moves. Finally, going along with the original plan, incorporate the Oculus rift with a card-table, avatars, and different environmental settings for a truly immersive out-of-the-world awesome experience.
