                    Speech and language delays and disorders affect 1 in 12 children in the United States [3] and are considered the &ldquo;most common disability of childhood, least diagnosed by primary care physicians.&rdquo; [4] Furthermore, delays in early identification of these conditions can result in delays in treatment, which is crucial for children to develop communication and literacy skills for school readiness as well as behavioral and mental health.
                </p>

                    It is estimated that smart speakers (e.g., Amazon Echo and Google Home) are already in 30 million American homes, and they are used regularly by children and are designed with features specifically for younger users [2]. However, none of the existing voice-enable interaction on these smart speakers is capable of detecting and assessing children's early speech development, despite its ubiquitous computing power for automatic speech recognition.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Super Word" is an Alexa quiz game for children age 4+ (as well as adults who are non-native English speakers) to play in a quiet environment independently. This game provides a sound effect, a question, and or a brief description for the child/adult to guess words that cover most phonemes in English [1] across multiple categories (e.g., nouns, actions, and adjectives). By using the Amazon automatic speech recognition to process the child's pronunciation during the gameplay experience, "Super Word" provides a preliminary screening of an individual&rsquo;s speech production in order to determine whether the child&rsquo;s speech development is on track or whether a non-native speaker's speech is intelligible. This information can be extremely crucial for both parents and healthcare providers (e.g., pediatricians) as well as educators.

                <p>
