                    Hi my name is Albert Wang. I&rsquo;m the technical lead at Soothe, a well-funded startup based in Los Angeles that does on-demand massages to people&rsquo;s homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soothe is spread across the world, in over 50 different cities, including Seattle, the home to Amazon. With a smart phone, a customer can book a massage with us via iOS or Android, or if a customer has already booked with us, he may already use our Amazon Lex chatbot to rebook a massage, which I&rsquo;ll later demo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a 24/7 call center for our massage therapists and clients to contact us. Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t always respond to texts and calls as quickly as we would like, so we worked with our call center manager to determine some of the biggest drivers for call and text volume. We tackled a few of these issues, including massage therapists who are texting to check-in and check-out of appointments. They&rsquo;re also calling to get prioritized offers for upcoming appointments. Additionally, clients are frequently making bookings not through our mobile app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amazon Lex allows us to handle the increasing call and text volume, and it allows us to quickly deploy new changes and features for everyone with less code and resources needed to support multiple mobile operating system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re really happy to demonstrate solutions for our massage therapists and clients, and the following are demonstrations of the Lex API integrating with our Ruby on Rails backend API.
                </p>
