                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I used Ionic to build for all the platforms. Firebase was used for  authentication with the Facebook Login Product, realtime cloud database, cloud messaging and many more.
I also used a couple of Google API's such as Maps, Places for location geo-coding, maps, location tracker and search for nearby Places
