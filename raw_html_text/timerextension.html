                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our underclassmen had to do online practice for AP exams and needed a timer, so we did this so he wouldn't cheat by gong to other tabs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implements a timer that can be incremented by the buttons provided, and in the end it rings and cannot be exited unless gone to another tab.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used the google get started tutorial for chrome extensions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't really know javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually finished a functional extension, considering this is my first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to actually make a project (my own project for once).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TimerExtension
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reusability and stacking timers and breaks.
