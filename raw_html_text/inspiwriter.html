                    <li>
                        Sarah came up with this idea during a hackathon idea generation activity the two of us did
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are mental health apps. There are also journal apps. But no combos...
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        InspiWriter aims to make good writers and good people with journal prompts. Choose one of many prompts from our three current categories and fill them out whenever you feel like doing so!
                    </li>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We decided to use  a client-server side with prompt storage (because what if there's n topics and each has 100 prompts??)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our server storage is in a lovely Firebase Database, here we store all the prompts to declutter the app, and the topic idea helps with that. The demo video above is a scenic tour of our server.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the app, we developed this for a Pixel running Oreo in Android Studio.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And of course, we built it with love.

                            <em>
                                Answer in a language that isn't English, Pig Latin counts.

                            daily prompt notifications were something we wanted to accomplish in time for this but because they're hard to configure we'll see them later when we don't have ~36h to make an update

                            possibly more features as we delve into cool stuff you can do with Firebase and Android, we've only touched the surface here and we both intend to develop this deeper.
                        </p>
