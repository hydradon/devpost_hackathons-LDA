                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an executive of the Black Students Association (one of Western's many student run clubs) I've found that one issue which me an my team has faced is having a way to maintain constant engagement with the members as well as management of so many things going on simultaneously. In addition, I've found that a difficulty many of our members have faced is having easy access to information about club events and registration. Unless they know someone on the executive team it's hard to keep up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sure. There's facebook. But does anyone really like having to scroll
                    <em>
                        all the way down
                    </em>
                    to find that post someone made about an upcoming event? And let's be real. It's kind of hard to reach new people when the only people you can invite to your events are people on your friends list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to build Club House. A place where clubs can easily put information for their members to find. As students there's not much time to make a website for our student clubs, so this alleviates the stress. In addition it's a one stop place for student's to keep up with all school clubs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clubhouse is a platform that allows student club to manage and create events to keep their members updated. Each club has a "club house" which is essentially a web page were all their members can find information regarding the club. We know that student leaders don't have the time to develop a whole web page so we've taken that step for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can additionally keep track of the clubs their in, see what clubs are available to join, see what club events are nearby.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                    HTML, Java script and CSS.

                    We hope to make the website fully implemented and add features that allows a club to fully customize their webpage
