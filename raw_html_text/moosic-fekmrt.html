                    I am really tired right now because I've had about 3 hours of sleep in 2.5 days. You may have seen other people running to go get cookies or food as soon as it was presented, but I felt as if I was solving real world problems so I was constantly engaged in Moosic.

                    Music is obviously a huge part of everyone's life and what better way to enjoy each other's taste in music than to argue about who gets the AUX chord or to fight about who's the better DJ at a party. Well, Moosic will solve your problem because now you can make a playlist together. It doesn't matter if you are in the passenger seat of the car, the backseat of the car, or even the trunk! You now have the power to do whatever you want and express yourself through music with my Android app Moosic.

                    I plan to add in up votes and down votes, and along with that, a ranking system with badges, reputation, etc. Hopefully expand this app to many different backseats around the world. Had a really great time developing the app and especially enjoyed every bit of the MEAN stack(Mongodb, ExpressJs, AndroidSDK, Node.js). :) Thank you BitCamp!
