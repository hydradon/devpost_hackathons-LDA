                    The story is about a man in a room, he is trying to come to grips with his surroundings and figure out what happened. It is a multiple choice, text based game.
My teammate was: Luis (Couldn't find his email)
I had help from Aaron.
I have posted a Youtube video, going through the program. Here's the code (It may have bugs due to Devpost changing the configuration.)
