                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to promote healthy living by encouraging people to spend their days doing useful activities and rewarding their attempts at improving their health.

                <p>
                    Sometimes, getting started on an activity is the hardest part, and you don't know what to do. Go app suggests activities for you based on your physical fitness and your current mood. Activities are suggested with a click of a button and it's up to you to decide whether or not you want to make the first move.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using the MEAN stack written in Javascript source code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Decoding the framework to find the parts we needed to modify and make it our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overtime, more popular activities are suggested as they are weighted by how many people choose to do the activity. We hope that over time, we can integrate a social aspect to this project and integrate better machine learning algorithms so that users can join up and meet each other.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about routing endpoints and services and better familiarized myself with JavaScript.
