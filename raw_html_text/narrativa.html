                    We should be able to experience the talks the way the author imagined, whether we were present and watched it live or are online just seeing the talk slides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But not every meeting, meetup or conference has the logistics and infrastructure to record the presentations. And in the end, there is a loss of context when you see the shared slides. We are only able to see the visual aids the speakers used, but none of their spoken words. Imagine seeing a foreign film without knowing the actors language or with the sound turned off. How much would be lost in that experience?

                    With Narrativa you can easily create slides for a presentation. You can place the complete transcript of any slide, and Narrativa will automatically split it so it displays gracefully as subtitles.

                <p>
                    Talks are one of the most important tools when sharing knowledge inside our communities and this app tries to close that gap between the offline and online experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Complete list of featured:
-Automatic subtitles. Just write or paste the entire transcript of a slide and it'll get split evenly so it shows gracefully in short amounts.
-Automatic saves on the browser local storage. Your entire presentation is saved on your machine even if you are offline.
-Shareable urls for the slides. You can publish the presentation and share it with people who can see it online.
-Fullscreen mode.
-Easy navigation to specific slides via thumbnails.
-Simple and easy to use UI to add, edit and view the slides.

                    How I built it

                    Used React for the UI and interactions and Python for the back end.
