                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found data privacy to be an interesting theme but we added a twist. We examined data privacy on a spectrum, from private to public. Data privacy is necessary in some cases, but we wanted to see what happens when people are able to air it all out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Venmo is a currency exchange app that allows other users to see what people are spending their money on and who they are giving it to and receiving it from. Like venmo, we wanted to see what would happen if people's text messages were viewable by everybody. OpenWeb allows users to come on to the site and view people's messages as their being put out. Essentially, it's one giant group chat so you can see what all other users are saying. Perfect for the nosey individual that always wants to know who and what people are saying on their phones.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the recommended major league hacking website and loosely followed the instruction to create our own messaging web app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was both of our first attempts at coding so we struggled to come up with ways to apply our ideas. Using the mentors and resources available we were able to come up with a simple yet effective way to show the consequences of actions when using technology that ignores safe cyber security.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that through OpenWeb we are able to raise awareness for Data Privacy. Through the extensive use that OpenWeb has experienced in the past 24 hours, many of our users have been able to see how important private messaging is and how they would not like if their private messages were put on blast for all to see. Therefore, OpenWeb has had great value in allowing users to learn about the importance of Data Privacy and the consequences of improper data storage.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code and the importance of cyber security or lack of.

                <p>
                    We plan to use it as a effective method to show the consequences of insufficient privacy online.
