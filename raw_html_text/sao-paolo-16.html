                    The Problem:
There are so many people, many need to go in similar directions.
There are traffic jam and no one knows how long the wait is (there is very little and inaccurate information from the radio regarding traffic).
                </p>
                <p>
                    All these people have Internet and location enabled smartphones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that we can solve these problems by introducing a walkie-talkie like-app to connect people. With this app people can send and receive messages within a limited radius. People can reach other people nearby, and ask "Can anyone take me to xxx?" Or drivers can reach passengers by saying were they are going to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are in a traffic jam, you can broadcast to anyone within a mile to get a status, ... or if you lost something you can reach out to the community to help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe in the people and what they need is a tool to connect and to communicate with anyone nearby.

                    Sao Paolo 16 is a messenger app for the people of Sao Paolo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It implements a "Smart City" concept, to connect people and to give them a tool communicate and help eachother in real-time (Web 3.0).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Messengers (Text, Voice, images) are broadcasted to anyone nearby (within a certain distance). With this tool people of Sao Paolo can connect and discuss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drivers can look for co-drivers in their area, and passengers can look for drivers in their area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there is a traffic jam, you can talk to other people nearby through the app to find out why and how long the traffic jam is. It's an innovative concept that can make a huge difference how a city operates and how people help each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: 
The name comes from "real" walkie-talkies, where as the "Channel 16" is the emergency channel.
