                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I own a google glass, and my partner wanted to build his own since they are not easy to procure. We happened upon a pair of snowboarding goggles with HUD and talked through the problem of display. After that we realised that it could be easir to mainstream the project if the parts were cheaper and orderable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frugal Glass is meant to be customizable to the user. In this case, my team works in network security, so using it to monitor networks was a really cool use. Liam added the ability to recievce SMS since he wanted to see how close to Goolge Glass he could take the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leonardo pro micro, 64x48 OLED, HM-11 BLE, mirror, LI-PO charging curcit, and 280 mAh LI-PO battery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our BLE module was DOA, which was a frustrating 4 hours to discover. As well as there is no library for OLED displays to rotate. Unfotunatly we didn't have time to build a full library for the OLED. Our optics guy also dropped out at 2AM the day of, so I bought a mirror at CVS, shattered it, and made an AD-HOC optics system for the demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the OLED work and display some pretty cool data such as an octocat, SMS message demo, and a real nice boot animation so you know it is on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my personal first time working with Arduino, and anything associated. Last project we had, Liam did all the Arduino work and I made a webserver on an RPI. So I learned about SPI, how the TX and RX work. We built a charge curcit as well so I learned proper power distribution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Frugal Glass
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a BLE module that works, then finishing the library to rotate the display.
