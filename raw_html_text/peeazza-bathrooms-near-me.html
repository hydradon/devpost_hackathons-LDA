                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, one of us just had to pee and didn't know where to go!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It drops pins at the nearest bathrooms to you on a map, and if you select one, it will show you information, such as what amenities the bathroom has, and hopefully will someday show the user ratings for the bathrooms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the WRLD API, and built a Python backend. We then were shown how to use Flask to connect the two, and ran them locally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have ever built a web app, nor do we have any experience in HTML or Javascript! It was all really new, so it took a lot of googling to figure it all out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we actually figured out how to set up Flask! It was a huge struggle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SO much about web development! Mostly just learned about the basics and how to get started.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PeeAzza - Bathrooms Near Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to (after fixing all the bugs lol) add user ratings, so you can see which bathrooms are nice or gross! Then, we plan to build it in a phone app, so its easier for students to use. We also could maybe have comments, so you can see any recent live updates on conditions.
