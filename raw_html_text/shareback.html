                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever been asked at checkout to donate to a cause, and hesitate because you're not sure where your money is going?
With ShareBack, your donation stays a credit to the store you're at.
Our partners at local homeless shelters will provide vouchers to those in need.
These members of your community will then redeem the credit you donated for a free meal or item.
It's that simple.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our platform allows a small business to become a participating partner by accepting donation credits redeemable at their own location.  Money is money -- there's no difference between money spent at the company through traditional means or via ShareBack credit! More business = happier business!
We then look to partner with local homeless shelters to give out vouchers to those in need redeemable at these locations.  Let's get homeless individuals involved in the community at the same places the donors are.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app uses QR code tech to provide a proprietary page for each on boarding business.  The monetary allocation is handled securely on the backend.

                    Design problems don't exist in a vacuum: it's important to evaluate a whole system when developing a robust solution, which is what I aimed to do!

                    What's next for ShareBack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a highly scalable project with large potential for launch in the Baltimore area.  Would be interested in discussing partnerships with local foundations.
