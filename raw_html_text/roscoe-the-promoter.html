                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy going to see my favorite artist perform, and I wanted a easier way to get details about these performances.

                <p>
                    This Chat Bot uses the Bands In Town API to provide information about artist in the music industry. A user will ask for personal information, business information, or for upcoming concert details about an artist. In this case personal information is a link to the Facebook page of the artist, and business information is a link to the Bands In Town page of the artist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this Chat Bot using Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda. This Chat Bot uses two lambda functions which are both implemented in Java 8.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Just trying to figure out what all I could and couldn't do in Amazon Lex.

                <p>
                    This was my first time using both Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda, so that was cool. I'm glad I got the experience and definitely plan to keep using them.

                <p>
                    That Bands In Town had a public API, and how to use Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda.

                <p>
                    I want to provide users with the ability to order tickets when concerts are found. I also want to start including the city in the search.
