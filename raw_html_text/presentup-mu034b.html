                <p>
                    We thought it might be helpful to have a way to improve and practice presenting seminars or other public speaking tasks besides chanting in front of a bathroom mirror. We wanted to make an application that would provide a more curated form of feedback to the presenter which helps them improve more quickly.

                <p>
                    We used the Cognitive api from Microsoft's Project Oxford to recognize facial expressions of the speaker and to track the face as well. We used Express for the routing and used d3 to generate some visualizations for the
