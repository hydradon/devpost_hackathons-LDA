                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A couple of us are taking an integrated circuits course whose premise is to design a simple computer that runs simple operations such as addition and multiplication from scratch. The catch? The class has us design the computer using transistors. The process can be tedious, and this application hopes to speed up the process between coming up with logic and creating an electrically valid schematic that executes said logic in circuit simulation software (LTSpice in this implementation). It is worth noting thaxt the use case would exist primarily for education (EE courses) as the process for industry has already abstracted what we do here.

                    <li>
                        Interpreting the boolean algebra to be formed into CMOS logic was harder than we thought it would be. We imagined we'd just use a stack and in the same way a calculator performs operations (popping values, evaluating an expression, then pushing the evaluated expression onto the stack). However, certain logic needed to be preserved and the same boolean algebra expression needed to be interpreted differently between the pullup and pulldown network necessary for CMOS design.

                    <li>
                        Time was our enemy, we ran out of time before we could implement a lot of quality of life design features... Such as parenthesis
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Given a (very) simple boolean algebra equation, we are able to generate a netlist for the corresponding NMOS pull-down network and PMOS pull-up network.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We are then able to translate this netlist into the proper schematic syntax utilized by LTSpice (circuit simulation software).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Because the schematic is valid, it can thus be simulated in LTSpice.
