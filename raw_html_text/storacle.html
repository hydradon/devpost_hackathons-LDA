                    A box with a camera and weight sensor. Each registered user can take or leave anything they want, but each transaction is tracked and logged. An ultrasound sensor detects the box closing. The objects are recognized by their shape and size with opencv (e.g. a triangle of size 10) (this works), and uploaded to the cockroachdb database. The next time the box is closed, the objects would be downloaded and looked for in the new image. We also intended to use a load sensor (scrapped from a kitchen scale) to corroberate the camera's findings, however we could not amplify the output enough for it to be readable via our beaglebone's analog input.
