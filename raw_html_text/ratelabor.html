                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app is primarily for survivors of trafficking and people who are at risk, to help them in helping each other avoid the situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People who are looking for work in potentially sketchy situations can see the ratings/reviews of employers/recruiters and also rate/review employers and recruiters.  If someone is trying to deceive someone else into an undesirable situation, this app might give them a heads up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ruby-on-Rails. PostgreSQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app does not impact individuals without internet access.  This is a huge drawback, because many survivors and people at risk do not have internet access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If this helps one person avoid trafficking, I'll be stoked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creative solutions are a must for reaching out to people without internet access via the internet.  It's mission critical to contact individuals who have better insight into unfamiliar situations in order to make a difference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RateLabor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cleaning up the user experience and perhaps expanding the platform to also apply to other organizations, with better intentions, that could stand to improve.
