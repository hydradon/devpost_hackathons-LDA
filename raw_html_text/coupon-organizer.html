                    As students, we have been taught the importance of getting help as soon as possible when it is necessary. This is why we wanted to create a website for people to find the help they need, no matter what problems they may have.

                    We were not familiar with the languages needed to create this website, so we had to spend time learning.  We also had to manage our time properly so that we could fit in the many steps needed to create our website.

                    We are proud that even though we were not familiar with our coding language, we persevered and continued to learn in order to make a successful output.
