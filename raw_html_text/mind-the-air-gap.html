                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We read an article a while back about it being a possibility, but it didn't outline how we'd do it and if it were possible without specialized hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes data and then converts that data down to its bytes and sends those bytes out through Frequency Modulation to the recipient.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                    Reliably getting data from the sound waves.
