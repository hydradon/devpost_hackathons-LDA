                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the category &ldquo;Equity and Access.&rdquo; We wanted to focus our solution on the Georgetown Community, so we settled on a peer-to-peer book selling platform. The idea is that students can buy and sell books to each other, hopefully benefitting both sides more than third parties such as B&amp;N or Amazon. Also, we implemented our own &ldquo;currency&rdquo; through the website so that you buy and sell &ldquo;points.&rdquo; So, if you sell books first, then you have points accumulated that you can use, and you never even need to charge your credit card (which is stressful for many who have tight budgets.) You can always cash out your points for money as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It facilitates book sales from students to students. Our platform also integrates with B&amp;N so that we can list all classes for any given course. It is updated every semester to reflect the current specific requirements for each class section.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our site using Django. We used many different web scraping techniques to get data from B&amp;N as well as MyAccess.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A big challenge was accessing the B&amp;N website to get course info. Getting the info was hard because much of their data uses specific Id&rsquo;s that don&rsquo;t have rhyme or reason, so we had to do some hacky fixes.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud that we made a product that will benefit the Georgetown community. We played to our technical knowledge and also learned some new skills, trying to make the most of the 36 hours.

                <p>
                    We learned that we are really good at cup stacking -- go team 6!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have many plans:
*1 Implement a price compare from B&amp;N and Amazon. 
*2 Finish making the buy/sell feature more robust. 
*3 Integration with classy.thecorp.org, Georgetown&rsquo;s most popular registration tool. 
*4 Working with the school to buy students credits for textbooks.
