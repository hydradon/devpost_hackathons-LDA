                    We wanted to make something that was simple but allowed us to learn and live, laugh, love along the way. 
We were inspired by Yuval's dedication &amp; hard work.
We learned how to strong pair program and built our project. 
We used each other's strengths to finish on time. 
We avoided the challenge of merging conflicts. 
We learned how to class design.
