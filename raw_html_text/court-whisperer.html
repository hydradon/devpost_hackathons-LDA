                        We divided the project work into our areas of specialization. Walked through the customer's journey to understand the challenges and we divided the work so that each person could begin work. Dan, Judd, and Taylor developed the app architecture, Bob and Mathias studied the user flows and interface requirements, while Katherine provided the overall subject matter guidance and project inspiration.
