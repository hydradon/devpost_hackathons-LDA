                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to learn and create a hack since it was my first hackathon, and from the starter "Hello World!" program, I decided to make my own pop-up with a question and answer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It asks you your first and last name and how you are feeling, then giving a built-in response based on your answers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used javascript through the website repl.it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am new to coding and wasn't sure of some of the functions, so I needed to search for them online
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud I was able to learn and apply a sample of the javascript language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding is fun
                </p>

                    What's next for HappyHacking
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add it to websites, where it takes into accounts of different users and their satisfaction, finding problems so website developers can improve their websites to increase customer satisfaction.
