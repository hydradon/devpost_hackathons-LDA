                    Community is a place for people to connect, engage, and grow together as a family joined by the same interest. As we go online, the number grows bigger, and the challenge to keep the essence of a community it self is inevitable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Background
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are co-leads of a local developer community in Bandung, Indonesia. The community has 1300+ online members and 110+ of them attending our regular monthly meet-ups.
We always organize networking sessions during our monthly meet-ups, hoping that they are going to meet and start conversations with others who share similar interests. However, we found out that our community members were passive, not conversation starters, meaning they did not approach other people to find out whether they shared similar interests or not. We believe that they would miss many valuable chances, ideas, or opportunities because of this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We suspect that this issue is tightly related to eastern culture where people tend to be passive as opposed to the western culture where people tend to be open and sociable. During the
                    <code>
                        F8 Hackathon
                    </code>
                    we have the chance to talk with other developer community leaders about this problem, and it turns out that many circles face the similar problem:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Seoul, South Korea
                        </strong>
                        , they faced similar problem with us. They tried to create smaller sub-groups during the networking session and encourage the community member to connect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Bangkok, Thailand
                        </strong>
                        , the lead said that his community members are mostly shy and need to be encouraged to talk, otherwise they would not.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Malang, Indonesia
                        </strong>
                        , although there were networking sessions organized during the meet-ups, most of their community members went straight home.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    By and large, those and our community members need external push so that they could get the most out of it.
