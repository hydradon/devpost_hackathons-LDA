                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wouldn't want to read an about me from an author about themselves. I'd rather get a neutral and honest opinion on the person based on tested trials. This is applicable to schools for assignments, theses and for jobs to personality assessment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads through the text that is written and gives 3 outputs. One graph showing the characteristics in humans and how much of each is there in you. It also gives a list view based on percentage on each feature. Finally we have a paragraph on the person to understand the graphs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used the bluemix api and java. Followed the instructions and ran for samle data sets. I saved the data for 2 datasets and we posted it on a website for a user to look into.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While configuring blue mix with the dataset and getting the code working with this.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost gave up, but wanted to complete it and somehow managed to push it and make it work by the morning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot! Bluemix, all their api that I used.

                    What's next for Project Epiphany
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Try to make this for realtime and probably for social analytics where the data is discrete.
