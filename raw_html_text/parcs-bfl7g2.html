                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The usual process for reporting community issues related to government-owned recreational facilities involves trekking to public Town Hall meetings at your City Hall only to sometimes be left unheard. It is a tedious process that often results in no change. We strove to fix this by creating a mobile application that removes the "bureaucratic red tape" and gives
                    <em>
                        all
                    </em>
                    members of the community the chance to alert their local officials of hazards, criticisms,
                    <em>
                        and
                    </em>
                    raving reviews from newly implemented changes.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    PARCS gives community members the abilities to: submit a request for an issue, submit a review of a park, and be kept up to date of local community initiatives! Whether a user is a resident or just passing through, PARCS works all around the country and gives users a convenient way to maintain and uphold parks and recreational areas.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We prototyped the application with Figma and Icons8 and finally animated it with Principle to provide a live walkthrough of how users will interact with the mobile application.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally started with tackling the first prompt related to gender equality in the workforce. We wanted to target ne After running through several ideas, we found systemic flaws in each due to the inability to change internal logistics within a company. We realized that the revolutionary change we wanted to make is extremely challenging and requires more inside knowledge and reflection beyond this 10-hour period. Thus, we decided to tackle another issue that we all have had experience with. Our main challenge during this hackathon was finding a worthy problem to tackle that had an attainable solution. Our current topic allows us to start small, but still have a monumental impact on local communities!

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we spent longer than expected in finding a topic to work on, we are proud of being able to adapt to time constraints and finishing what we set out to do. We were able to apply our knowledge of prototyping and design skills to produce an application that effectively solves a problem we are passionate about in a creative and engaging way!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From this project, we learned that the brainstorming process is within itself an integral yet challenging part of tackling many of the large issues at stake today. We learned that although we may not entirely finish a project, we did create something that has the potential to be improved and expanded.

                <h2>
                    What's next for PARCS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that the data collected by our application can be useful beyond local governments easily finding what needs to be fixed next in the community. For example, activists can use requests or reviews made and local changes (or lack thereof) to drive their campaigns with real data. Thus, the next step for PARCS after implementing is to make our data publicly accessible through an API. After all, in this day and age, data often speaks louder than words.
