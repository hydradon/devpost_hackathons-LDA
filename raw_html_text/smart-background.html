                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by building a webpage for a smart mirror. As the project developed we realized we didn't have the skills or time so we settled with creating a page that tells time and weather in your local area!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tells time and weather in your local area
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented some API's into some HTML code and made a local website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Literally everything. We came into this with no experience with HTML, CSS, or many coding programs. Our biggest challenge by far was implementing API's into our code. It took us a long time to figure it out.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The images that dynamically change with the weather
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic website design using HTML, CSS, and experience with an API
                </p>

                    What's next for Smart Background

                <p>
                    Adding more APIs! (and implementing it into our smart mirror)
