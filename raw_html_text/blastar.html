                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Nintendo Switch Joycons are very interesting and versatile, and the fact that you can track position and rotation with them relatively well inspired us to make a game utilizing their motion capacities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This game uses two joycons to emulate flight sticks as two players fight off to the death in space while avoiding asteroids.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used blender for modeling and Unity/C# for programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the actual data from the joycons provided a struggle since they are not meant to work with pc's. Also, accurately getting the joycons to rotate around is difficult considering that there is only so much a gyroscope can do. Finally, it was our first time using Unity, so there was a steep learning curve we had to overcome.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create a game that looks relatively good and uses the joycons to fly around.
                </p>
