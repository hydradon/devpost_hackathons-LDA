                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, three eager freshmen and one weary senior felt that it was possible to code a free-world game in Unity in 36 hours. Inspired by Breath of the Wild, they set out to create a legendary realm in which dragons roamed, players explored limitlessly and landscapes were breathtakingly beautiful. 
Instead we present a simpler, arguably more usable alternative: a greeting that, without an exception, can be used at the opening ceremony of every ensuing HackPrinceton.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prints out the time-tested, fool-proof greeting.

                    A couple simple yet incredibly insightful lines of code in Dr. Java.

                    Compilation completed. 'Nuff said.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't be too ambitious and try to code an entire free-world 3D game in Unity without prior experience coding in Unity. 
But also we learned a shit ton about Unity and will complete our project in the future.
