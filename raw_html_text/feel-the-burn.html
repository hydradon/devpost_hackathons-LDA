                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States while nutrition related factors contribute to about 45% of deaths in children under the age of 5 years old. Both of these tragic causes of death can be avoidable. With further development of the website that we have created, we hope to decrease these deaths.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user inputs their gender, age, weight, and height. The site uses this information to inform the user of the amount of calories, proteins, fats, and carbs they need in one day. The user then continues to input the food they ate that day, including the nutrition information. The site then adds up the total calories, fats, carbs, and proteins you ate and compares it to the amount of those nutrients you actually need in a day. This allows the user to self evaluate their diet and tweak it to fit their needs. It holds the user accountable for the food that they ate that day and helps them to have a good portion size in order to not undereat or overeat.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built through the language Python through the text editor Python Anywhere.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this hackathon, we ran into many problems. A major one included scrapping away our original plan of making the website through JavaScript, HTML 5, and CSS. We had very minimal knowledge of JavaScript, making it difficult for us to code because although we understood the logic, we did not understand the syntax. Due to these reasons, we decided last minute to switch our project from JavaScript to Python, because we came to the conclusion that we would be able to create a better product using python.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite being first time hackers, our team properly communicated and contributed to making a comprehensive website that showcases our beginner coding skills to the best of our abilities.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a significant amount of syntax related to JavaScript, and while it was not enough to create a website, it still gave us more exposure to the computer science field making very valuable. Furthermore, by attending several workshops, we were able to learn about how to approach emerging into the STEM world as a woman, and how to deal with the problems that women face. The workshops also taught us more about the college admissions process allowing us to become better prepared for when the time comes. Lastly, we learned about the importance of teamwork, time management, and preparation ahead of time in order to create the best possible product.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given more time to work on this project and gain a more comprehensive education of javaScript, we would turn the website into an app that allows the user to take a picture of their food while the website identifies the food and ingredients in order to accurately analyze the amount of calories, protein, carbs, and fat that is in the dish. This would make the app more convenient as one would not need to know the exact nutritional facts of the food in order.
