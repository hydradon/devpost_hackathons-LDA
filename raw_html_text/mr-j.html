                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our struggles during our transition between CS1101s and CS2030 pained us. It was difficult transitioning from Source, an unknown language we have to learn, to Java, a popular, beautiful, and awesome language. Thus, to prevent future to-be computer science students from following our path and experiencing the same pain, we have created Mr J.!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr J. is a fun game that teaches java concepts at the same time! Suitable for all ages, kids will be able to have fun, and learn java at the same time! So that in the near future, when they finally come to NUS to study computer science,  they will not suffer in CS2030 like us, since they already know Java!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It teaches Java in a fun and entertaining way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity, and lots of hard work. All the art is hand-drawn by us, and animation self-animated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compile error. Learning Unity, unable to complete pre-planned features due to lack of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a playable and useful game. Learning Unity and C sharp in a day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity, patience and optimism.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mr J.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expand on features and concepts taught. Improve on the games available and increase the amount of games available. Release DLCs and microtransactions like any self respecting triple A game.
                </p>
