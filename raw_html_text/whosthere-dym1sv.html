                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our past failures in 120b projects. 
We had some hardware parts that we wanted to use for 120b project previously, but we could not in the past.
After the final project, unfortunately we did not have time to go back to the parts.
So we thought Rosehack2020 will be great opportunity to finish the unfinished work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    "Who's there?"
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, our front-door security system detects motion. 
Once it detects the motion, it takes a picture. 
The picture is then sent to be analyzed by Google Vision. 
The Google Vision will tell if it's a person or a package. 
Accordingly, the system will send an email to the roommates with the picture and the message saying whether there is a person or a package.
Also, if it's a person, then it will use face recognition api to tell if it's one of the roommates. If it's one of the roommates, then it plays welcoming music. Moreover, the door will automatically open; we have a servo motor to simulate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used raspberry pi and python. 
We started with the parts that we never got to use in the past projects, then jotting down the ideas that we could work with the parts. We have a blueprint of our system the we kept referring back while working on this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything went well, until we faced the speaker. 
We spent the longest time on the speaker just to get it connected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like we mentioned earlier, this project is made of the unfinished jobs in the past.
As Computer Science students, we are busy. We want to go back to our projects, but time don't allow us. 
Now, we can say we used every hardware part that we paid for, and we expanded our knowledge to the fullest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first project using python for most of us. 
It was a great experience to see how python works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for whosthere
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our system simulates what we can actually build for actual uses. If we buy a bigger camera or a built in speaker, we can program it and start putting on our front door to see Who's out there at the door!
