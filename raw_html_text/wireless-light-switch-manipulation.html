                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So when I joined this hackathon, I looked at the parts I had with me. I knew that I wanted to do something with Hardware. I saw that I had these RF modules laying around so I decided to base my project with that. I have a deep passion for assistive technology and saw that some people can't reach their light switch and I went from there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project turns on and off lights from a light switch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using 2 Arduino Unos, a 433 Mhz transmit and recieve modules, a 3D printed enclosure and a servo motor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I first started out, I tested that the RF board could talk to each other by using the Serial Monitor in Arduino. Then I hooked up a button on the Arduino with the transmit, and a Servo on the Arduino with the recieve.  Once I verified that this was working I went onto the 3D modeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the 3D modeling, I used OpenSCAD to design the case for the servo, and printed it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So this is my first project where I programmed something that wireless. I didn't realize how often spurious signal occurs on the receive. This subsided when I changed the range the reciever module needed to change the value of the Servo
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm pretty proud of how well it actually manipulates the switch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a ton about incorporating wireless things into hardware. Prior to using the RF Modules I tried out a ESP8266. Although I didn't end up using it, I feel more comfortable using these types of things and plan to use them in future projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wireless Light Switch Manipulation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to get it to eventually work with a particle photon with an Alexa Dot as the interface the user uses to manipulate the switch.
