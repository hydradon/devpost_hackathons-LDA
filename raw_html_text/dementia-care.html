                </h2>
                <p>
                    To help people with dementia to live normal lives at home without 24/7 care, hence freeing up hospital beds and allowing people to keep their independence. Hospital bed cost per day: 360pounds. Smartphone: 80 pounds. Sensor: 10 pounds.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps monitor people with dementia. As a consequence, it helps caretakers become more efficient, by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        avoiding unnecessary checks on their patients, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        knowing which patients require attention, and with which priority
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    e.g. patients are assigned medicines, and are set intake times. A light sensor in the medicine drawer detects whether the patient has taken the medicine, and it gets reported to the server. It is detected if a patient doesn't take medicine. The patient is called to remind them to take the medicine, and ask why haven't they, if there's a reason. If the patient replies, If the patient seems in distress or doesn't reply the call, an incidence with high priority is generated for the caretakers. The caretakers have a incidences dashboard, and they act upon those incidences.
