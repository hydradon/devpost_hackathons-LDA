                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the video, there was mention of the amount of water lost through ways outside of those normally discussed (long showers, leaving faucet running, etc.) So I thought about what other ways water could be lost through the system and eventually thought of this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Detects a change of water flow from one (start) sensor to another (end) sensor and sends an alert if the difference is significant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using 2 water flow rate sensors and the resistors and wires provided in the kit. Also with a few sections of sprinkler pipes and some valves to simulate a pipe break.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use the ARTIK. Getting the sensors. Also the specific parts needed (Only one hardware store had the necessary parts for the pipes and valves.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making something. Also that the pipes did not leak when i tested them on the first try.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's is harder than it seems to make even simple things. No matter how much planning is involved something always manages to go wrong on the first attempt.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pipe Monitor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ultrasonic sensors and ARTIK 1 boards to allow for use with greater distance between the sensors
