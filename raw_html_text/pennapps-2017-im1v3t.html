                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be fun to try something we've never tried before, so we utilized tips we've already learned about ruby and made a program that does something fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program prompts the user to enter a string, and once the user has done so the program takes note of how many characters are in the string, then replaces them with any of the 255 ASCII characters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Ruby programming language, as we are most familiar with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, it was difficult to visualize what we needed to do in order for this to work, but after we did that we quickly got to work and completed and tested the project.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    As a group, we are proud that we did something we've never done before and had fun doing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned some new tips and features about the Ruby programming language that we may be able to make use of one day.
