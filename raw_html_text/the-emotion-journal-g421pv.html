                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Journaling has proven psychological, stress-reducing, goal-orienting benefits when done regularly. But for many people, writing is harder than talking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a voice journal. You talk to it about your day and it analyzes your emotions and stores the logs. If you do it once a day you can see a visual representation of your feelings and experiences over time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used IBM Watson to power real-time emotional analyses and speech-to-text/text-to-speech, and React/Node.JS/Express.JS to create a voice-powered interface for real-time feedback and journal analysis and storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accurate detection of emotions via text is a work in progress, but far more accessible to developers than it was even a few years ago.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely proud that The Emotion Journal actually works! You can record journal entries and receive real time emotional analysis! And we did it in one night :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the tools being developed to assist developers, there are going to be many opportunities to use AI to improve people's mental health, confidence, and productivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Emotion Journal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps an app? :P
