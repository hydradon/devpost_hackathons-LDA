                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team shared the common experience of needing to be more organized. However the solutions that were currently on the market were not fun or appealing so we decided to create our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application allows you to post a to-do and have the people in your circle verify your results. You compete against them via leader boards and achievements. Professors will also be able to make achievements for students to obtain and become more motivated with school work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using the meteor.js stack, SASS, CSS, and Bootstrap all while being hosting using AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally tried to used Dynamo-db however we soon figured out this was not possible given our time constraint.
                </p>

                    What's next for Git-it-Done
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Porting this web application to mobile developments and making it into a chrome plug in. Also allowing users to create their own achievements which friends can obtain!
