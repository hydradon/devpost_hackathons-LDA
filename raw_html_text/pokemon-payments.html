                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always had a love for pokemon and a fond distaste for paying the bills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you pay your bills with my app, you enter a pokemon fight with a random pokemon. You can use moves like "Payday", "Dig... out of the red zone", and "
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I first established a webpage with Flask, then I implemented a webpage from which I could run Nessie API commands, so that payments could be verified with an account and then transactions could be matched.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how much I could accomplish within the limited time provided. Especially when determining how much "pokemon" I wanted to integrate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the flask interface and have moved on to the python-api portion, hopefully, I can implement a working model with names soon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've learned a lot about Flask, which is awesome for general rapid prototyping. I also have learned a lot about Python modules and how to implement them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pokemon Payments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hope that pokemon payments can become a fully developed web application that brings young adults our age back to a nostalgic time, and takes the edge off paying the bills with exciting text and images.
