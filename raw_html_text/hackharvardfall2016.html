                    Our app facilitates lending and borrowing of things like books, tools, kitchenware, and games, especially for the college student sector of the population. People earn points for lending items and they spend points when they borrow.

                    The Future of our Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to include profile pages so that people can be rated on their returns.
We hope to include filtering by location and solidify out filter-by-category system.
We also love our fox theme, and would like to include some more animations. It is a particularly foxy theme, we think.
We also want to make it like Venmo, where if users run out of points, they can pay for more.

                    Things we Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained plenty of experience in troubleshooting the sqllite database. Furthermore, we gained valuable experience in front-end development and design. For example, we taught ourselves the basics of Bootstrap(!!)
