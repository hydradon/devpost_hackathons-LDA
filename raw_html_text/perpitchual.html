                    Inspiration - As average vocalists, one problem that we typically would run into is finding a starting note of a song after a key change. Adjusting to find the best key for a particular song is difficult after hearing the original key - the melody is hard to grasp.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - This program allows the user to input the original key and the desired key to transpose into. This process entails the starting note being uploaded in a wav file and then shifting x amount of steps needed to obtain the wanted note in the new key.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - Utilizing python's vast collection of libraries, we compiled a number of functions to successfully transpose the notes.
