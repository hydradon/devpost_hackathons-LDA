                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love to party (on occasion). Though, sometimes, the music sucks at a party. What happens? People spend most of the time fighting for the aux cord to play a song they like, or they bombard that one friend with unlimited data with song requests. How do we fix that? Crowdsourcing music recommendations!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an iPhone and web app that lets you vote and add a song. The song with the most votes gets played next.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Firebase as our backend, good 'ole vanilla Javascript on the web front-end, and of course Objective-C for the iOS app.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Firebase: The documentation was good, until we tried using it and found some use cases that weren't documented at all - we weren't really doing anything fancy!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Javascript: This is one is completely our fault; we decided to use Firebase as a backend and use vanilla Javascript on the web client side. This didn't work out too well since it made even the most trivial tasks troublesome!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We finished? The web app looks ugly since no design was done to it, but it works (for the most part)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I learned new stuff! Firebase, Javascript promises!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It's 2015. Don't use vanilla Javascript on the client side. Especially if you're a back-end developer who never uses Javascript. LEARN A FRAMEWORK!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Firebase. Small and awesome; it helped a lot and I can really see it speed up development if used correctly.
                    </li>
