                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The JIRA users often require aggregated view of efforts based on underlying subtasks from an Issue type. In order to summarize the efforts of the subtasks, users usually prefer scripted fields. Generally, the values would get aggregated based on the classification of field value or Status. Would it be feasible to create a large number of fields, each for this classification phenomenon? Here, it is possible to choose the classification factor of aggregation from Issue type directly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we choose the Project, Issue type and a field, it aggregate the values and displays in the JIRA issue. The field could be status, custom field or any other standard field. This aggregation could be accomplished on parent-subtask, Epic-Story-Subtask or Story-Subtask levels.
I will upload a live demo for the aggregator plugin very shortly.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    The add-on is built in java using JIRA API and the user experience is in progress.

                <p>
                    We believe it is a good idea, and we are pushing ourselves to complete and introduce the Aggregator into the market place.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This being our first add-on, this is boosting up our interest in the Atlassian community and products. We will further gather more ideas for aggregator for improvement and also in different platforms in JIRA
