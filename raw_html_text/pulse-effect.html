                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to give people a way to musically express themselves in a new way, through simple motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reacts to your movements (ex. raising arms) and generates sounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product has 2 devices: one connected to the camera and the other connected to the sound synthesizer. The camera sent the frame data to the computers, which process the data and send it through the network. The other computers receive the data and make change of the music based on these data through the sound synthesizer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult challenge we have faced is how to integrate the wrnchAI and the OSC library together and building the software. It is more because building a software is a very overlooked part of a software product and has not been taught thoroughly in the university.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Passing the challenge mentioned above. We feel extremely accomplished when the product is successfully built and released to an executable software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Intuitive ways to map gestures that sound natural, user experience that has a very low learning curve yet catches peoples attention and interest. Also teamwork and programming skills, how to work on a deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sound of Movement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More types of interactions and movement available and ability to support multiple people on screen.
