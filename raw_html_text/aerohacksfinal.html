                    We built a simple android application which can stream gyroscope and magnetometer data in order to give pilot's additional yaw, pitch and roll measurements.  Our app would stream data from the plane's sensor into the hands of the pilot, enabling him to simultaneously access map data.  This would particularly be useful in older planes where upgrading the cockpit panel is extremely costly.  This app provides an alternative to this upgrade by displaying relevant telemetry data to the pilot's phone instead.
