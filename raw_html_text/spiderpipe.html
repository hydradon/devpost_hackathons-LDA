                    The proposed idea mainly focuses on solving the water pipe cracks problems where there is a flow of water,
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    to solve this issue we developed a robot which can be used in search and rescue operations, using sensors like pressure sensors, cameras, and RADAR technology to use it to inspect water pipes, where it can scuttle about, checking pressure meters and searching for any leaks or wet spots.
