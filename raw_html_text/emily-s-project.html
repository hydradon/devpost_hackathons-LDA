                        My Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    Coming into this Hackathon, I was very excited to learn new things, but also nervous that I wouldn't be able to accomplish much because I still consider myself very much of a beginner. One of my friends introduced me to html and I was instantly hooked. He showed me how you can create web pages with it and I decided to create a project using html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a short and simple project containing 5 files containing links to each other, text, and images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I developed the source code using
                    <em>
                        Brackets
                    </em>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since I was completely new to html, I had to google some functions and ask my friend for the occasional tip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I built these pages primarily on my own and formatted them the way that I wanted. It was a very good introduction to web design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned, now, how to use and write in html, and I plan to expand on these skills in a near future web project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emily's Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will take what I learned in developing this source code and hopefully apply it to other web projects in the future. And I will definitely show off my little project to my family.
