                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are both competitive dancers. We aren't into fitness at all, we just love to dance and we want to be able to do so in a healthy way. There isn't a resource out there for people like us that tells us what we should be eating and how we should be taking care of injuries. Most teams have trainers that would help with this kind  of information but we are not professional or pre-professional athletes, so we don't. Therefore, we decided to use this hackathon to address this problem for ourselves and our peers in intramural sports leagues, club teams, and other competitive circuits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A website that provides various resources for self-care.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node js to organize all the content and wrote the content in HTML, using CSS to format it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are both beginning coders (engineering majors, CS minors) and this is our first hackathon, so basically we didn't know much when we walked in. Our biggest challenge was bridging this gap and trying to make something functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Again, because we didn't really know what we were getting ourselves into, we are just proud that we were able to be here and have the opportunity to learn so much. We are glad that we were able to get something together and that we are taking away so many new skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Node js and CSS, both software packages we had just heard of before. We also got a lot better at HTML coding. We also learned how to use tools such as Github and Sublime.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Everyday Athlete:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really like this idea. We will continue to improve our website programming skills (hopefully at other hackathons because we really had a good time!) and hopefully have this website running in the future.
