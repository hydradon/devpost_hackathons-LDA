                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love guitar and coding
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    treis to find a chord by searching for it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    using html and css and javascript, (i created the json file storing all the chord data) but I couldnt get the read function to work so nothing appeared after I searched things up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding how to integrate the API was the most difficult, I ve never dealt with anything similar to this before
                </p>

                <p>
                    Familiarized mysefl with html, css, havascript, etc.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gonna try to make it work with the API and hopefully integrate sound AI, to recognize chords.
