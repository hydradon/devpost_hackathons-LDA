                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our groups creativity, and wanted to share that creativity through a type of story telling game that would take the user into another world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user is able to choose various adventures from five different themes and will have different outcomes based on the decisions they make in the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our game by using cloud nine to code our javascript, HTML5, and CSS. To design the actual game we each chose a theme and programed an adventure path for that theme. At the end of our 24 hour work time, we combine all of our stories into one game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all beginners in computer science, so one of our greatest challenges was learned the languages enough to make our game in the given time. We were able to learn a lot through a workshop, various mentors, and online resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all very proud of the fact that we came here with little programming skills, especially in the languages we chose to code in, but were still able to make a fully functioning final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about javascript, HTML5, and css logistically, sense we had little knowledge of them before hand. We also learned quite a bit about teamwork and what it would be like to work in this field one day. Additionally, we all learned what a hackathon is, sense this is are entire teams first one!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Create Your Own Adventure
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will keep trying to improve it by adding to the graphics and plot of the game. We also were interested in adding riddles in between the different paths during the adventure.
