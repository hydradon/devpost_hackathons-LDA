                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every term begins with piles of deadlines set. How stressful. It's even more a headache to add all the dates to the calendar...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sillyabus is a GUI that populates your assignment deadlines and exam dates to your Google calendar with one click. It extracts the dates and events (assignments, midterms, quizzes etc.) from multiple course syllabi and outputs to your Google Calendar.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Python with PyQt5 using Google Cloud API  (Google Calendar API).

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half our team are not experienced in Python so we had to learn on the go. And neither of us have ever used the Google Cloud API so we had problems with the authentication. One of the most difficult challenges for us finding a way to extract the dates and important details needed from different course syllabi formats.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to use Google Cloud's API and being able to create an interface linked to the API in  Python. Most of all, we are proud of surviving our first hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use multiple Python packages and became more acquainted with Google Calendar API. We also learned how to create an interface in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sillyabus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To improve Sillyabus we could create our own API so that we can integrate it into any app. Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing we can better filter and extract the important dates and information. We could also make the program more customizable to create a more personalized experience for the user so they can choose what they want to put on their calendar.
