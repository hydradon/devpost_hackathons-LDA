                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle: ah the motto we've been hearing as far as we can remember. Yet only 1 percent of the 5 trillion plastic bags consumed each year are being recycled. This is detrimental for our environment as we waste much of our natural resources (such as oil), and nearly 10% of all plastic bags end up on Earth's oceans which have harmful consequences for our wildlife friends. It also takes nearly 10 centuries for plastic to decompose which is awfully long to get rid of human waste.

                <p>
                    What best solves this issue is the use of a tote bag!

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, when you take a picture of your tote bag of groceries and a dated receipt that supports that purchase, our app rewards you with cryptocurrency that you can use in our rewards store. You can claim coupons, discounts, and myriads of other cool rewards from local businesses that supports this movement.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we scraped a bunch of images of tote bags and grocery bags so that we could for image recognizance via tensorflow. Using Android Studio, we developed a user friendly and fun interface (similar to Snapchat and Instagram). We also made it cross-platform for web users as well.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was using tensorflow and android studio. The integration was difficult, but we were able to overcome it via help of our fellow hackers, mentors, and google :).
