                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were discussing some of our favorite passtimes as kids and realized that all of us had played trading card games at one point. We loved collecting cards and battlnig against our peers, and we wondered why trading card games are so unpopular now. There hasn't been a new popular physical trading card game in over a decade, because the infrastrucure and advertising cost to make such a game popular is infeasible. Hearthstone is new, but is run entirely from a centralized company, making the cards feel less intrinsically valuable because their stats could be changed at any moment. We wondered if there could be some way to mimic the feel of owning and trading cards digitally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a card game, supported by an Etherium contract. In this contract you can buy cards, trade cards, and sell cards. This contract is decentralized from our central server, so the cards exist outside of our company.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed an Etherium contract which allows for owning, trading, buying and selling trading cards. These cards have different stats, making some more valuable than others. We talked about our favorite aspects of card games, and came up with a fun card game that is easy to learn but hard to master. This game is played on a website we created which uses sockets to communicate between players.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The use of Node.js as a backend was new to us, as we had always used python and Flask to host our sites. Node, however, proved useful once we understood how to use its libraries. The use of sockets was new to us as well, which caused some challenging bugs that we conquered. Nobody on our team had written an Etherium contract before, but Alex created a fantastic system for making our idea a reality on the blockchain.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our teamwork and communication in this project. We split up into each person working feverishly on their own section: Nico on Node.js, Alex on Etherium, James on game design, and Max on FrontEnd. We communicated our goals interfacing and ideas very clearly to each other which was a fantastic help in each person's understanding of the project. We're also very proud of the game design that has gone into the game itself. We playtested and discussed our game tons of times.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how Etherium contracts work, how Node.js works, how Sockets work, how to design a card game and so much more.

                <p>
                    We plan on deploying and advertising our game at our school, because we enjoy playing the game and want more people to play.
