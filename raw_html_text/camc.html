                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> This is my first hackathon . In the beginning ,I was reluctant to approach another individual and talk with about team formation. There was this invisible barrier that stopped me from approaching others because I didn't know about them and they didn't know about me. So , to overcome this distance our app comes in handy.

                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Our app is functional only for hackathon events. It allows individuals have a small background information about name and which type and level of skill another person has with just a click. In a click, the app gets access to the in-built camera and takes a photo of another person in front of us. It then compares the picture taken with the picture in the hackathons database and displays the information on the screen.
