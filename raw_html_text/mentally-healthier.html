                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone at PixelHacks II, including our team, attend the highly competitive high schools of the technologically-focused Bay Area. As a result of high stress, many students suffer from mental health illnesses, but keep their emotions closeted as they believe they are alone and their feelings are not valid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Health Yourself is a website that provides resources for these students. One resource is a (prototyped) diagnostic test that would take user-inputted symptoms to provide a possible mental-illness the user suffers from. Along with descriptions of common mental-illnesses, the website suggests actions that the user can take to help themselves through their illness if they feel that they cannot tell someone else yet. However, it also provides ways that they can reach out to others through hotlines and medical professionals to seek aid in their journey to well-being. 
Another aspect of Health Yourself is a (prototyped) mobile application that has all the same resources as the website, but also implements a notification system that reminds the user to take care of themself, whether it be through taking a shower or drinking some water.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized html and JavaScript to create our website and linked it to a .tech domain for easier user-experience. For the prototype of the mobile application, we used NinjaMock to create the potential layout of the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was not knowing how to code html in depth. Two members of our team were familiar with html while the other two had no experience at all. Additionally, PixelHacks II was the first hackathon that any of us had attended.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of all that we have learned while creating this project. We created an accessible website with minimal coding experience in html and organized our thoughts to create a cohesive and useful idea at our first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most important things we learned were to take risks and to know that trying something new always pays off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Health Yourself
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the website portion of Health Yourself, the next steps would be to hire medical professionals (and to gain some more experience in html or possibly gupshup) to make the diagnostic test as accurate as possible. Another idea we did not have the chance to implement today was to create a chat box to talk to someone in real time through the website. 
After development of the Health Yourself application, the next step would be to sync it up with Apple Calendar or Reminders to allow the user to create a schedule of good mental health practices, such as sleep schedules, self-care,  and physical activity. Additionally, using the data from the survey, the app would create a mock schedule of suggested activities to do throughout the day to keep users healthy.
