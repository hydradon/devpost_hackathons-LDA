                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoyed making codes when I was younger so I had quite a few ideas laying around that I wanted to try.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It encodes and decodes text  for security reasons
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using windows forms in c#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with operations that weren't table based, table operations are the easiest to think of but the most tedious to implement, and trying to make the code cleaner because it wasn't until the later stages that I began adding features that were not originally going to be there because I had finished the base project before I intended to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That all the operations can work together in any number of times. Also the logo I made for it in MS paint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making use of approaching the same operation in different ways to make it easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Crypto
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If they're are no bugs I could add more operations, maybe an app to send these messages to others via text.
