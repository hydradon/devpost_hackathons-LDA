                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project was to do something with the Nest. Since there was a camera and a thermostat, and the camera was taken, I chose to use the thermostat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Modifies nest thermometers and their temperatures using the leap motion controller and and web platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used gestures from the leap motion to interact with angular.js's stored variables, and these communicate with Nest's api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Nest has a very limited development kit (still giving me problems)
2) Hacking alone for an entire project is difficult
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Hacked the entire thing alone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots to do with the leap motion and using some other company's apis.
                </p>
