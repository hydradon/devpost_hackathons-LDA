                    Although Augmented Reality is not new to the retail segment, we will like to further expand on the idea. CamShopAR as the name suggests, is an Augmented Reality shopping mobile app where user uses his phone's camera to scan on any object he or she is keen to purchase at anywhere, but unaware of the name and specifications of the product.

                    An Augmented Reality image of the product will pop out, along with the name and details of the product(such as size, brand etc) a hyperlink button will link to e-Commerce websites where the user can purchase the product online. In other words, CamShopAR aims to be an interactive aggregator where users can use to make online purchases of merchandise that captivates them conveniently without knowing the specifications of the product if they are unsure.
