                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired because in our own school &amp; community we see women judge themselves on a daily basis. We want everyone to be confident &amp; be able to look at themselves everyday without judgement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website will be able to serve as an informational web, there will be facts on the positives about being confident and such. This websites will also serve as a blog, where everyone can write the things they love about themselves. Only positive things will be allowed!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website through CodeAcademey, as first time coders we though this website would be helpful and we could not get to do much but this is as far as we got. We used HTML &amp; CSS through codeacademy!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into difficulties since the beginning. As first time hackers he did not really know what kind of software or coding language to use, so we just googled a bunch of websites that could help us out. We originally wanted to make an app, but we did not have Macs, to use the IOS development from MakeSchool as well!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how far we got. Although it may not seem like a lot, this is really impressive to us, seeing as we did not have much coding experience. We are proud of the topic we came up with since we know this is an issue everywhere in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that coding is really fun, there were different types of ways you could insert fonts and change the colors. The images and videos you can code are all so impressive. I never would have thought that coding would have worked like this.
