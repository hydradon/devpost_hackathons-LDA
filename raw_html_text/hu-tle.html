                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has worked on group projects, whether doing group homework in school, hacking at a hackathon, or co-founding a startup, but not all team members respond equally. Many of us have suffered through using group messaging apps and still having that one member that ignores group conversation and never responds. We believe that "time is money," so we made Hu$tle to help teams respond faster so they can save time and make sure no time goes to waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hu$tle works like any other messaging app, but makes group members that do not respond to important conversations pay for the time they have wasted. Groups set an amount of money to be fined per hour when something is said that needs a response from all members. If a member does not respond, they are losing money by the hour! But don't worry, that time is not wasted. Money a member is charged is donated to Hack Harassment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an iOS app using Xcode and Swift 3. The backend for the messaging was built with Firebase and the money transactions were implemented with Capital One's api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of errors building the chat feature that would fit our vision. We wanted a specific look and changeable chat bubble colors to convey importance. In addition, we needed to convert a substantial amount of older Swift code to the new Swift 3 code. This caused a lot of issues with debugging and using resources online, but we made it through the challenges with the great help of VTHacks mentors and sponsors!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With only a small amount of iOS experience, we tackled a very challenging project using a new programming language. We are also proud to have used our first api in a hackathon project!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to build a group messaging app, build a backend with Firebase, use the Capital One api, use Github, and do a whole lot of debugging in Swift 3!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hu$tle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to continue working on Hu$tle to make it more polished and include more features for different types of groups using it.
