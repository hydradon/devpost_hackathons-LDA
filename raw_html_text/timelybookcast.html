                    What is TimelyBookCast?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The TimelyBookCast app is a service that polls the PaperBackSwap (PBS) book trading site hourly. The latest book posted for trading is pushed to the Whencast as a new event. The book cover is used as the event image, and a call-to-action (CTA) button allows the user to visit the book page directly to order.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What the heck is PBS?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PBS is a service that allows users to mostly older, hard to find books by trading books they already own with fellow users. Each book sent out by a user (to another member) earns them a credit. That credit can then be used in turn to request another book. Users can also buy credits or earn credits through a paid membership. But more importantly to us, PBS also offers an API which allows developers to search, access user bookshelves, and other tasks.

                <h2>
                    How does it work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every hour, the following workflow kicks off:  The
                    <code>
                        getBook.js
                    </code>
                    file fires a GET request to the PBS API and retrieves a JSON package with the latest book posted for trading. The details are passed to
                    <code>
                        castBook.js
                    </code>
                    , which posts the book details to the Whenhub schedule as an event using the Whenhub API. A subsequent call using
                    <code>
                        castImage.js
                    </code>
                    sends the book cover image to the Whenhub API as a media attachment for the newly-created event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Where does it run?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app runs on AWS as a timed Lambda function. This is very time and cost-efficient means of running the app, as it consumes minimal computational time (being run every hour). Lambda avoids us having to pay for idle cycles on a standard AWS server.
