                    Following the explosive popularity of Pok&eacute;mon GO, Pok&eacute;mon trainers have been struggling with a lack of inventory space and the physical challenges of traveling across the land searching far and wide to catch'em all. PoGoRobo is a trainer's best companion. It loyally follows its trainer, carries items, and represents the trainer's team using LED lights, all while allowing the trainer to focus on catching Pok&eacute;mon. PoGoRobo was built wiith the help of Arduino, duck tape, cardboard, a small robot base, and the drive to be the very best like no one ever was. Our main challenges were training PoGoRobo to recognize its trainer with the Pixy camera and optimizing power usage. Despite these obstacles, PoGoRobo can autonomously follows its trainer and represent their Pok&eacute;mon GO team. We learned how to use Arduino to control the robot and to detect the color of the trainer's shirt.  As a result, we were able to get the PoGoRobo to follow us and accompany us on our journey.  Our next step for the PoGoRobo will be to mass produce a more polished version so that trainers all around the world can become the very best like no one ever was.
