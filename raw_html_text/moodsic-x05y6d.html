                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from algorithms on music streaming platforms. Spotify and Apple Music both utilize algorithms that recommend playlists that have a certain mood or emotion associated with the songs, and we wanted to mimic this algorithm without a person to individually tag all the songs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm uses a spectrogram to analyze the frequency and amplitude of audio input and output a categorization of the song as one of three moods: happy, sad, and calm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used spectrogram.py library to convert audio wave files to spectrogram images. Then, we passed in a dataset of 100 songs labeled as either happy, calm, or sad. Using Google Cloud AutoML, the trained model predicts the mood of new song input based on a comparison between its spectrogram image and the training dataset.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adapting to new technologies and tools such as the Google Cloud AutoML and Spectrogram conversion algorithm.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clear distinctions visible between spectrogram images per mood
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to learn and use new technologies in a short amount of time, working on a time crunch, developing both front and back end for an application.

                    What's next for moodsic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Functionality: moodsic is an avenue to feed in musical audio input and output a mood categorization for each song.
Usage: users feel noticeably different after listening to a song recommended by our application.
