                    So, it's based off the game Miitopia by Nintendo, a game I recently completed the main story of. For this project, I thought maybe I could implement a new system into it, an endurance test that's a basic summary of the game. A boss battle, of sorts, where you have to fight round after round of enemies (with a healing break in between).
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The only part I had actually coded is part of the first round, between three Rock Moths and the player.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I used it with Tynker's block system, since I don't really know any coding languages really well.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    One of the main challenges was trying to scroll in the Tynker system, but I figured out how to work decently with that via closing the drop-down menu. The one main issue that I could never get past, which is exactly why I only did part of the first round and turned into a garbage beta, was that the player character would always repeat their attack on end without stopping, and I couldn't figure out how to fix it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I'm glad that I was able to even be in this competition, and that it works well up until the player's first attack.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I shouldn't really think that such a big project could be completed in 24 hours, I should just do it over winter breaks or something.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Well, since I couldn't really work it out properly, I think I will keep my spreadsheet of the enemies, and try to do a live-action version of it instead. I feel like I could do better at a film than a code in 24 hours (as long as I can get a script, enough people to be actors, and models for the enemies [probably cyborg creatures.
