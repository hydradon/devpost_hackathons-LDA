                </h2>
                <p>
                    People are able to search location by name or address.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by implementing the existing google maps API through the andriod studio IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's was challenging to understand the google maps API and since we didn't have the API key. We also couldn't find any online resources to help us understand how to use the google maps API. We couldn't get the current location from the google maps API.
                </p>
