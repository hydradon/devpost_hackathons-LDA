                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding parking spots in Toronto and in other urban centres eats up a lot of time, and is not always feasible. Framing our hack around addressing this ubiquitous problem would also allow us to explore and develop our expertise in using various technologies - from hardware hacking with arduino, to developing a react frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An ultrasonic sensor positioned on the ground, by the entrance and exit of a parking lot detect 'cars' which pass over it, meaning a car has entered or left a parking lot. From this, a python script updates the properties of a parking lot (number of spots left), and with the help of Google Maps Geolocation API informs the user whether or not they can park in the parking lot nearest to them, and if not, where the nearest parking lot is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Arduino Uno microcontrollers along with Ultrasonic sensors to develop the physical component of detecting vehicles entering and leaving parking lots. Our web application linking collected data to a user interface had a front-end based on React and Javascript. Processing of data was done with Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack consists of three differing systems. Our primary challenge lied in connecting them to create a fluid solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we had our 'hardware hack' component involving Arduino, sensors for data collection and python for processing the collected data. Working with Arduino was something we were inexperienced with, so working with that component alone was a challenge in itself. Secondly, we developed a Javascript core handling the Google Geolocation API, and lastly a React frontend to give users of our application a nice experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interfacing the data form our arduino to the database, and using the Geo Location API to track distances from parking spots was the most difficult part. Individually each aspect was manageable but bringing the different components and displaying it in the front end was our biggest challenge.
