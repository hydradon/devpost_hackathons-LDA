                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After looking at crime data, we realized that some routes to and from campus were dramatically safer than others&ndash;even if it was only a diversion of one/two blocks. Unfortunately, crime heat-maps only spot-check areas and generally block out large districts as "unsafe." As a UW student, avoiding the entire U District is impossible, so we built SecureSteps to provide a safer commute for our community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SecureSteps uses crime data to optimize walking routes to your campus. Whether you're a local, or a new member to the community, you will be able to walk to campus knowing you are on the safest optimized route.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SecureSteps is a web application in js, css, and html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time optimizing the routes effectively and consistently. We went back and forth between Google Maps and Bing to find the best way to re-rout based on crime data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although the product was difficult to build, we ended up with a functional prototype and proof of concept. This was an accomplishment.
                </p>
