                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Timor and I wanted to create something that not only met the goals of this challenge, but was sustainable, cost effective, and honed in on our skill set. By creating a survey, we thought although it is a simple idea, it can be embellished to do much more than take answers. It is a practical and efficient solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Satisfaction survey can takes user input to survey one of two items: a Smart TV or a wireless speaker. The survey will ask a series of questions followed by the option to leave an open feedback. This allows for the customer to not be limited to preset questions. At the end, a satisfaction report is given. The report gives feedback according to the answers given from the customers as well as a score for overall satisfaction. This gives any data analyzer the ability to get a quick broad view of the customer experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The logic behind the survey was all in python. The script takes user input and forms if-else statements to create an output for the report. The web page was made in HTML. A web framework was also used, Lask. I did the logic, while Timor did the front end and we both struggled together learning how to use Lask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Timor and I were both new to Lask. Although it would have been better to write the logic and code in JavaScript and HTML, our experience in coding limited us quite a bit. We are both in our first coding class, CS112- Intro to Computer Programming, this semester. Our will was stronger than our limitations as coders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are both proud to have participated in such an impactful event geared toward STEM education all while learning and having fun. We are proud of our project, because hard work really is fulfilling when the product works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we have a long way to go, but we are at an amazing university where growth is possible. We are excited to delve into this journey of technology, development, and innovation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Satisfaction Survey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, this survey could cater to more than just customers who bought Smart TVs and wireless speakers. This style survey could be used for any service provided. More questions could also help with accuracy of the "Overall Satisfaction score". A more complex GUI could also be on the horizon.
