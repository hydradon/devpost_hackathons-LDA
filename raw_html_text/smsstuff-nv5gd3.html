                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When going through customer service, we had to call and go through a series of routes to get to our destination. So we wanted to have a shortcut that allows us to go straight to our destination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes inputs and you can write it all at the same time and it will take it in as a list. It also allows us to call people back with XML using one of Twilios API. There are also a couple of Easter Eggs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first were getting used to Twilio's API by learning how to send and receive messages and calls. We then added more functions like Clarifai and Giphy to access images. We used JSON  to make a library to access the routes that let us travel to the destination and let us shortcut to the destination
                </p>

                    1) from_
2) Also, we tried to implement a Python Interepreter, but it proved to be difficult.

                <p>
                    Making a robotic voice talk back and making a video game using texting.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about flask. We learned a lot of APIs from Twilio.

                <p>
                    We will probably parse information from actual database. With this, we can have users authenticate themselves as who they are and when they have been authenticated. Their phone is saved onto the database and whenever the database receive a text message from that number, they will know who it is and what information to send back.
