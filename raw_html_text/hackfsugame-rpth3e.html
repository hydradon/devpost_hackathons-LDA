                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team originally wanted to create a game for Oculus rift and 6 hours in we found out our computers wouldn't work with Oculus. Since I had already began learning Unity, I continued to mess with it as we brainstormed for our next project. This was my entire team's first hackathon so we were all pretty lost. We kinda decided to look around and do our own thing so I went back to Unity and made this game.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A ball is controlled by arrow keys and it goes around the plane collecting cubes. When all the cubes are collected the game is over and you win.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity created this game and had videos explaining the functions of their program by creating this game. I got to learn this new system as I went along. I did add the middle design after learning how to construct walls. I also added a start menu from a YouTube tutorial I found.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was my first time having to go out and find the programming rules it was tough. There were a lot of times I couldn't figure out why my code didn't work when it looked exactly like the tutorial, or when my screen didn't function the same way the tutorial did. I also had to start over a couple times, due to issues I couldn't fix and didn't know how to undo.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was so excited when I got the ball to move the very first time, and I felt so good when I finally figured out how to add text to my game; it took a couple of hours. I am also proud that I was able to find other functions to add to this game.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to learn how to find resources online to create games and apps. I learned how to make a game using Unity. I also learned how to make an iOS app Thursday night.

                <p>
                    I definitely plan to keep it since it is my first game I made. Not sure if I will be adding to it. Unity had several more complex game tutorials that looked interesting.
