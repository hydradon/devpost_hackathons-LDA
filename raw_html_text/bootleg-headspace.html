                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meditation is nice and cool, so I decided hey why not build my own meditation software(Well's it's actually an app), but you get the gist.

                <p>
                    You play how many minutes you want to meditate and what environment you want to meditate in.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Unity with some simple C# code.

                <p>
                    First was teaching my other two team members on how to use Unity. The second was how to implement what type of screen goes with each minute(i.e.: fifteen minutes in a beach area.)
