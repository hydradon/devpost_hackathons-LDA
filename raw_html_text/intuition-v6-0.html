                    Inspired by a friend of ours who has trouble waking unless despite the number of alarms and missed calls. Therefore we created an alarm clock that is able to send SMS to the friends of users who have slept through their alarm clock.

                    We learned how to use pygame and apply twilio API. We first split into 3 groups. One worked on the tracing game while another other two worked on the whack-and-mole game. The last member worked on how to send message to another friend through the API Twilio and incorporate that into our app.

                    Our biggest challenge was merging the different parts together and making the whole process run smoothly.
