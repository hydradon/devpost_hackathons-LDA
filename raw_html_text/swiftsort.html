                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Silicon Valley and setting up a sorting algorithm that hypothetically will be faster than Apple's included ones
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This will iterate from the middle of the array and fan out sorting all the entities in the array
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the basic Swift Language library and manipulated a created a custom sort class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UI of the Playground will lock up on load so I had to run a background function that would generate it's own array then sort it with the MiddleOut sort
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although the statements of the switch-case statements were similar to the now used if statements there would always be duplicated entities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some times if statements are better than case statements
                </p>
