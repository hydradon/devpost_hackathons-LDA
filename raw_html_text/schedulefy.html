                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team members worked for small organizations for many years. Organizations where the only way to keep track of who is working on which days is through a paper log that you can only see hanging in the office board. Also the only way we were able to pick up a shift, drop a shift, or see how a schedule looks like is by individually contacting your co-workers or manager.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows a small business owner to log in and add employees to his organization. After doing so the employees can log in and pick up/ drop shifts, or check how their schedule looks like. The manager also has access to remove employees if they no longer work for him, and check their work summary, and monthly schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using native iOS development. We did the user authentication using Firebase, and used SQLite to manage the database of employees and schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into include: configuring Firebase and trying to retrieve data from online database. It was also our first time working with SQLite so that also needed some getting used to. One of our team members never did iOS Development before so he also needed to get used to they syntax so he can utilize his backend skills and help develop the database tables we required.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel accomplished that we were able to generate an idea that affected us personally then work on a solution that works for us and could work for so many others. Another accomplishment is the fact we were able to take an idea and see what requirements are needed to bring it to life, learn them, then implement. All within such a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that its not easy to come up with an idea. However, even after having an idea does not mean its an easy sail from there. There are a lot of obstacles that will come your way because you cannot just tell your program what you had in mind. We also learned about importance of having a team with diverse skill sets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ScheduleFy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next thing for SheduleFy is to see how we can make the app more dynamic so we can allow different employees to access their respective employer's information. Then from there we can make the app available for all people that face the same issues we did with scheduling, so they can also SheduleFy.
