                <p>
                    We are three computer engineering students from the KU Leuven university in Belgium. This was our first hackaton and it was an awesome experience. We're also developers at Quivr(.be), a non profit student organisation in Belgium which let students check their schedule, what they can eat in the student restaurants, how much place there is left in the libraries and much more.
