                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the light of the recent events in Austria with the affair on vice chancellor Strache, it became more clear that politicians are a likely target of interest based donations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a graph which shows the relation between these donations and the voting behavior of German politicians.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We collected the data of politicians, their income and donations and the lobby groups where this money came from. We inserted this into a database and visualized the collected data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is only limited data of poll-data which already is categorized. Furthermore, German parties do not show any earnings or donations they are not obligated to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a graph where we can see the relation and even some correlation on voting behavior, lobby interest, and party earnings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A more organizational and creative approach on finding ideas.
                </p>

                    What's next for Price Of Politics

                <p>
                    Consider why there are correlations (it might be coincidence) and which behaviour is caused by what. Moreover, we want to expand the data we work with.
