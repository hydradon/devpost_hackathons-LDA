                    The process of creating lesson plans for a substitute teacher is so intensive and time-consuming that teachers who are ill will often choose to go to work sick instead of planning for a sub to manage the classroom in their absence. SubShell aims to simplify this planning process so that sick teachers can put their health first and stay home when they need to.

                <p>
                    From year to year, week to week, and even day to day, a teacher's schedule can change drastically and no two school days are ever identical. Most teachers who have to plan for a substitute are currently spending hours upon hours building substitute plans from scratch every single time they have to be out of the classroom. This process is so intensive and time-consuming that teachers who are ill will often choose to go to work sick instead of planning for a sub to manage the classroom in their absence.

                    SubShell alleviates this process by allowing teachers to quickly build an intuitive, easy-to-read lesson plan shell that already contains all of the basic need-to-know information for the day. With SubShell, a teacher can input their class schedule and management procedures, and SubShell will generate a daily outline containing all of the general day-to-day information about the classroom. This means that teachers who are planning for an absence will only have to focus on planning the specific procedures that are unique to the day they will be out of school, instead of spending the majority of their time rearranging old lesson plans to piece together a new sub plan from scratch.
