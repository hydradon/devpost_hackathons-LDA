                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the challenge put forward by mice and men to analyse the data on the network.
DDoS defence algorithm found in this article: M. A. Mohd Yusof, F. H. M. Ali, and M. Y. D., Detection and Defense Algorithms of Different Types of DDoS Attacks , International Journal of Engineering and Technology, Vol. 9, No. 5, October 2017

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have improved the DDoS defence algorithm illustrated in the article in "Inspiration", finding a method to determine a threshold for the amount of packet/s  that must be considered in order to drop them (see the figure 9 in the article in "Inspiration".  In that article, authors are not giving a method to determine their threshold (100 packet/s). Our method is based on a "smoothing procedure" of the plot DNS requests vs. time interval (See the figure in attachment). The trend of the resulting smoothed curve can be use as a threshold for the amount of packet/s  that must be considered in order to drop them in case of DDoS attack.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python programming language. We exported data from DNStap file  through  yaml module.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Data set was huge in comparison to the computing power that we had available in the given time.
