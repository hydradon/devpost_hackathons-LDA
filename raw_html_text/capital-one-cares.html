                    We still struggle to understand finance and about 44% of Americans do not even have a $400 cash to cover an emergency.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps the kids age 13 and above to be enrolled in this financial training. We have made it as a gamification platform where students can learn about finance and then answers questions on a quiz.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two aspects of this application:
Parents portal - Parent can register their kid and keep track of what the kid is learning and what reward he should get. The point of dollar conversion ration remains in their hand. Once the student/children reaches that level, the fund for example say $5 gets transferred from parents account to childs account
                </p>
                <p>
                    Student portal -
They go higher up in levels as they learn. They earn points for every quiz. They learn about investment on each and every quiz with practical scenarios. Some investment options that we thought to teach them were Certificate of Deposit, High-yield savings account in Credit union etc.
At the end of the 10 topics, they would earn reward from parents in real dollars and they can choose the best investment option based on what they learned in the course. However, the final approval of investment will to go to parents and they will approve it. 
We understand parents can also invest this money, but the whole concept is make children understand all this terms.

                    We will complete it and make it a full fledged app. We are also thinking of other ideas
-Using the points that students earn after quiz, would be used for a budget simulator module.
In this module, they have to make virtual purchases for basic necessities like utilities, rent home, food expense.
This will help them understand more about life expenses at such a young age.
