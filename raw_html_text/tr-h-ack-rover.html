                    Inspiration-We wanted to make learning experiences easier for coders that are inexperienced. Our team just started to code from September last year. We have learned the basics and now we want to teach it, show others that coding is not scary at all, and break it down for people.

                <h2>
                    What it does- Our application tracks down where the Rover is in our application. People can learn how to move it around and how it works as well as learning the boundaries of the controlled areas.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it-(Code) We used JOptionPanel to build the message boxes.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into-We couldn't get a visual(graphics) in time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of- As beginners, we are proud of making this code and how it works.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned- I learned to implement JOptionPanel and arrays and lists.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tr(h)ack Rover - As for code, we would like to create a visual such as importing graphics to see how the vehicle or rover is being tracked. We also would like to add more interactions with the people who is using this.
