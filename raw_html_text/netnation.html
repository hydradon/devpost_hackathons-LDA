                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now the
                    <strong>
                        logistics
                    </strong>
                    is a pretty inneficient business, every company has their own infraestructure in order to satisfy their own demands and most of the time they don't take advantage of that because if you take a look at a truck on the road, sometimes those trucks are empty; they're deadheading back. They've taken their cargo and then there's nothing on the trip back or they only have 20 or 30 percent of that truck filled. And that also happens looking at the warehouses and distribution centers. So why don&acute;t make use of the people that has the infraestructure in order to low down the cost and make use of the space in vehicule that either it&acute;s used or not, it will be transported.
