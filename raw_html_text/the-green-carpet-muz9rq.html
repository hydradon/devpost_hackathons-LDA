                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a large number of people who have died/severely injured because of delayed ambulance response. Specifically, the ambulances typically got caught waiting for red lights and for traffic to clear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program simulates what it would be like if the ambulance were attached with a functional device that would allow traffic lights to anticipate the arrival of the ambulance and clear the traffic ahead of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build a program that simulates traffic and an ambulance that is trying to get to its destination using the device.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1-Implementing the interaction between cars and traffic lights. 
2-Implementing the collision between car.
3-Implementing an algorithm that allows the traffic lights to change to green when the ambulance approaches.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1-learning how to use a new programming language (JavaScript) in order to build a webpage.
2-Coming up with an idea that has the potential to save many lives.

                    What's next for The Green Carpet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that the idea of The Green Carpet has the potential to be implemented in ambulances across the country.
However, there are some challenges need to be overcome. Being that technology required is relatively low-tech, we have to ensure that The Green Carpet would be implemented with the top security measures.
