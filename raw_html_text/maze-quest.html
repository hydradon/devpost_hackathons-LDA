                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As inexperienced coders, we decided we would create a simple project that could teach us a little more about html and javascript languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a simple maze, consisting of barriers players must navigate around, solely for entertainment purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first created a layout for the maze, a figure to travel around it, and then created the code for the movement and barrier functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As inexperienced coders, we struggled immensely with the barrier functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our movement commands were smooth and worked well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned much about html and java, including syntax and logic that is applicable for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Maze Quest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A next step for us would be a randomly generated maze to navigate through.
