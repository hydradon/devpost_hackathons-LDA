                    I'm a proud father and I

                        <strong>
                            love

                    </em>
                    to antagonize my kids with

                </p>
                <p>
                    I figured why not combine my love of building apps with my love of chasing my kids around, so
                    <strong>
                        BOOM

                        TICKLE MONSTER!!!

                <h2>
                    Why I love it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often times, technology pulls people away from real human connection. Tickle Monster turns that on its head and uses Alexa to help bring families together in the real world!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You start by listing who all is playing. Mom? Dad? Kiddo? Significant other? Grandma? Grandpa? The whole crew!
                </p>
                <p>
                    From there, you simply say "Ask Tickle Monster 'who's next?'", and the Tickle Monster will pick a name at random to use as the next tickle target, announcing it with varied phrasing designed to build suspense!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With heavy use of SSML tricks, including dramatic pauses, animated slide shows and different voices to make the Tickle Monster seem more like a separate personality within Alexa!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tickle Monster was my first ever published Alexa skill, and its original non-multimodal incarnation was mentioned in The New Yorker, Engadget, Venture Beat and the voice UX even popped up in a video with Mark Zuckerberg and Morgan Freeman!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tickle Monster!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going global with the help of my foreign language-speaking friends!
