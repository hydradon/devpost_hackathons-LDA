                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the incredible amount of effort that is being poured into advanced 3D-Motion Tracking by researchers and large scale companies today, developers rarely touch this paradigm because most people don't have access to the third party systems built around 3D-Motion Tracking. The thing is though, that people usually carry around the basic components for this form of interaction with them every day through their laptop and smartphone cameras! So we decided to build an api for web developers to begin to explore this new form of interaction where the client doesn't need to carry any extra weight.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Radar tracks motion in 3D through a WebRTC configuration between a standard smartphone camera and a laptop or computer webcam. The smartphone is horizontally placed parallel to the end of a laptop with the front-facing camera pointing upwards. X-Y movement is tracked by the laptop webcam, and Z movement (moving towards or away the laptop screen) is tracked by the phone camera. Together, any moving object can be tracked in 3 dimensions. All of this is done in browser, and can be used to interact with various web applications such as simulations, games, and navigation.
