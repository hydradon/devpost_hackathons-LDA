                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a learning experience for getting a datathon started, for using colab, and for importing json data with python calls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to import the data from the stock indices, which then allows you to easily perform analytics on this data. Should be professionalized more in the future

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of scraping
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two teammates quit. Python's syntax for dictionaries and lists is also weird and takes some trial and error to get used to. Finding other time-series to correlate this data with in a short amount of time is also a bit difficult.

                <p>
                    Dan ran into issues with scraping a limited number of sentiment analysis articles with Python, but he did get the initial scraping to work.

                    Getting all my team-members to use next-gen collab software like notion.so. Getting lots of help on slack.
