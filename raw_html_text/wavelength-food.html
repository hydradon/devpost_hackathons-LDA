                    Tons of food are being wasted on supermarkets, grocery stores shelves. All of this food is going to trash. Or in a better story it will be used as fertilizer to grow more food again. Which still a kind of waste. This waste is considered as a direct loss in food and money. No need for work arounds to solve this problem while it can be avoided from its roots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our system provides a smart way that helps food sellers avoid wastage and increase revenue!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Target: fruits and vegetables markets , fish markets, meat  markets. And all types of fresh food markets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's take a sweet apple as an example!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story begins on the first day of this apple leaving its home - the tree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first few days, this apple is so fresh and young! And everyone wants a fresh apple!
Next few days, it starts getting older. And demand on old apple is low. It's a bad end if it gets old and failed to reach our stomach! Because demand became less. Then the price should go less to help this little apple make its way successfully "to our stomachs"
We provide an innovative and accurate system to monitor and measure the freshness of food and change it's price dynamically.
Adding value to both sellers and customers and in the first place, our big mother "nature"
                </p>
                <p>
                    For sellers, we help them sell their food before they get rusty. Which assure them more money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For customers, we provide them an opportunity to buy food with lower prices and encourage them to buy older food to avoid let it rust on the shelves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For nature, we are avoiding the waste of the resources
                </p>
                <p>
                    To avoid human actions, an automated detection procedure will detect the life cycle of the food using NFC sticker which is sticked on each food package after preparing. (NFC tags has the advantage of being able to read it using mobile phones avoiding the need of extra hardware). Whenever the package is received the seller will scan it to add the new package to the system and the smart algorithm will start its job after that. It&rsquo;ll start increasing the prices depending on the freshness of the food. Customers can always search for food prices to help them reach the cheaper food before it&rsquo;s gone.
