                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Webster&rsquo;s Dictionary defines an &lsquo;oasis&rsquo; as &ldquo;a pleasant or peaceful area or period in the midst of a difficult, troubled, or hectic place or situation.&rdquo; Despite a drastic increase in women pursuing STEM-related fields, discrimination and bias still exist in the workplace, educational institutions, and online. Our team wanted to develop a digital space for individuals who identify as female to gain inspiration, knowledge and valuable personal connections from others who are passionate about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in order to fuel their drive to break barriers and find their own OASIS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OASIS is a collaborative social media platform specifically for women in STEM fields. It acts as a place to share content, learn about various STEM-related topics, make connections with other like-minded individuals, find mentors, and discover your next career path with your dream company.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a combination of the design software Adobe XD, Canva and Sketch to build the user interface and interactive components of OASIS. We used the website builder, WordPress, to develop our final submission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We first brainstormed ideas for what this platform&rsquo;s functions would include, then drew physical sketches on paper of what the interface would look like incorporating those functions. Along with the sketches, we developed three persona models that represent different user types.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first-time hackers, we were able to come together as a team and create a product we believe would help women pursuing or currently in positions in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. We successfully developed the prototype, the branding, the business plan, and also a website to display our project within 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn more about the scope of social media platforms and how they can be used as a source of community-building and inclusivity for underrepresented groups. Members of the team were also able to be exposed to different design tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OASIS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps include integrating APIs for third-party sharing to further expand the user&rsquo;s functional capabilities within OASIS, and develop partnerships with companies to generate revenue for OASIS and provide these partners with a platform for recruitment and global exposure.
