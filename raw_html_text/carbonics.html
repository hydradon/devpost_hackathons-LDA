                    </strong>
                    How to make the activity of being sustainable fun?

                        What it does
                    </strong>
                    It simulates a point-based and level-based game where you are awarded for each eco-friendly activity you perform. The user has the freedom to pick the tasks for the next day, earn points, and go higher on the global scoreboard. Green, enough?

                    <strong>
                        How we built it
                    </strong>
                    The app development was done in C# using Xamarin forms. The database gets updated with the latest user data online using Google cloud-powered SQL service "firebase" system. The database is displayed to the user using a website built with the traditional trifecta of javascript, CSS, and HTML.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Challenges we ran into
                    </strong>
                    Tonnes of them. Starting from integrating front-end app UI with back-end objects, and ranging to updating the database online (4 HOURS TO IMPLEMENT THIS!) and displaying it to a user, it was a challenging expedition we had.

                        Accomplishments that we're proud of
                    </strong>
                    Our product. With no experience in mobile app development or building a cloud-based database management system, it was a blast learning the ropes in these fields of software engineering.

                        Skills learned
                    </strong>
                    We each gained skills in software and languages ranging from Javascript, firebase, android-studio, to team-work in a sleep-deprived state. The night got cold.

                        Our Vision
                    </strong>
                    Just like Sweatcoin, we plan on making our scoreboard into the global leaderboard. In our opinion, we have contributed to making sustainability a fun activity!
