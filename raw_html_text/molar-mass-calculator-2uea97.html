                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't like calculating molar mass, so I developed a program to make the process easy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the user to input an element name and returns the molar mass of that element. Users can also add molar masses of different elements together and multiply the same molar mass by some number.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prior to the start of this Hackathon, I had no comprehension of Python at all. I'm proud of myself from completely starting from scratch to building this simple program that has useful application (especially as a student taking a chemistry class right now).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned of the existence of terminals, Atom, CSVs and simple ways to utilize them. I learned simple Python commands, conditionals, iterations, loops, the importance of debugging, and that hackathons are really fun and educational places to be!
