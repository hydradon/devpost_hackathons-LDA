                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We commonly use the split wise app to share our daily expenses among friends. An average purchase contains at least 5-10 products. However, entering the details of these manually on our smartphone is very tedious.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thus, we came up with "QuickBill", a smart solution to automate data entry in shared expense platform. Each merchant would append a QR code at the point of sales end of each purchase. Customers can scan this QR code that automatically sets the data into the app, making it very convenient to share expenses with friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built 3 modules for this project: An Android app for Point of Sales (PoS) that enables merchants to rapidly scan bar codes of listed products. This data is committed into a MySQL database over Apache and PHP, which forms the 2nd module. The 3rd module, an iOS app, enables customers to point QR codes that are generated by the PoS app on the bill, and generate the split bill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Main challenges were designing a great data solution, learning new language and understanding network communication to access data from the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app enables quick entry of shared expenses using intuitive point-and-shoot of smart phones over the QR code. This saves the customer's time manifold.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the challenges of developing mobile solutions in Android and iOS. Since we had 3 components, we got to learn lot of technologies and how they communicate with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for QuickBill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the near future, we wish to make the solution service-oriented, so that it can be integrated with mainstream products such as Split wise and Quick book.
