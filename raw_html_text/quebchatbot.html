                    queb (Queen's University Event Bot) is a Facebook Messenger chat bot allowing users to learn about local events in their area. It is aimed at Queen's students and residents of Kingston, but anyone can converse with the bot to learn about events in their area.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time either of us had seriously tried to build a bot, and the first time either of us truly delved into natural language processing. At first we didn't know the nuances and even core functionality, training our bot was more like teaching it bad habits than making a credible chat bot. We aren't big node users either, so we forgoed trying to structure the project in an elagant way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the facebook-events-core-by-location-core library, we were able to find local events and display them in a way that Messenger was made for. The bot is able to compare location and time desires from the user, and is able to filter events appropriately to meet their demands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Manual bot training is tedious yet initially important. In the future, I'd look more into automating bot training the bot to make more time for features creation.

                <p>
                    We need to solidify it's vocabulary and get it to consistently respond to commands correctly. We would like to integrate with Queen's Events, a group on campus that looks to help students organize, market, and contribute to events around Queens and the Kingston area.
