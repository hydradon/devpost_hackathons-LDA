                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For patients with Alzheimer's, recognizing things at the moment is difficult. A robot with eyes would help watch out for danger, as well as remembering the important things and people in their lives when they see them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses a camera to detect objects. Based on user submissions, a sticky note will appear next to the detected objects with a user-defined string, such as reminders, definitions, and positive quotes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AlwaysAI API for the object detection algorithm. We used OpenCV to insert stickynotes and text to the images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of trouble setting up our Dragonboard. Multiple problems include internet connection, Operating System update, Docker installation and AlwaysAI API installation to the Dragonboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained further understanding with the Debian system when troubleshooting the setup process on the DragonBoard. We also got the sticky notes to appear next to the detected objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned valuable debugging skills and the ability to persevere in the face of adversity.

                    <li>
                        "Forget me not": Implement facial recognition that determines if a person is recognized by the user. The product would remind the user of the identity of the person, as well as the relevant, preset information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Make new memories": Implement a video-storage system that saves important moments, as indicated by the user. The videos saved would be labelled; when something relevant is seen in the future, certain moments would be replayed for the user.
