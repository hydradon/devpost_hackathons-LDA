                <p>
                    Vertical farming is the practice of producing food in vertically stacked layers, typically in old industrial buildings in urban centers.  For a number of reasons, some listed below, we see vertical farming as the future of agriculture.  We're taking the first steps in creating GE's next big software offering - the GE Digital Farm.

                <p>
                    For a production build, this will require many more sensors (type &amp; quantity) - we used the provided Intel Edison board and Predix Machine to simulate some of the sensor data that will be used in production, light and temperature.  We pulled this into the Predix Time Series service from which we used custom algorithms to feed it into Predix UI in insightful ways.  Using existing Predix components, we were able to create charts to provide visualizations to help vertical farm owners gain quick insights.
