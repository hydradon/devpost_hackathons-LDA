                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both love gardening and wanted this community to have to the tools to reach more people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Northfield Garden Club's current website is unengaging, especially for young people trying to get involved in the community. This new website allows them to reach the rapidly changing college population of the town.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first big dive into web development. Using open source materials in html and css, we constructed this more dynamic and user friendly interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Constructing a project on this scale in only 18 hours is not an easy task. We had lots of trouble merging our various design ideas into one fluid product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very excited to have written an entire website ourselves!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interactions between various components of web development were new to us, but, excitedly, we read lots of tutorials and learned a whole bunch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for New Website for the Northfield Garden Club
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, we would work with the organization themselves to fully implement their content and hopes for their own community.
