                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes your temperature through a thermistor in Arduino and your age in Python. The resting and max heart rates are then calculated. Your heart rate is calculated in real time based on your temperature, and if it gets too high an alarm will play.
                </p>

                <p>
                    -The Python program did not connect correctly to the Arduino at first because it was our first time
-One of our team members had to leave due to an urgent emergency
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Using Python to read data from an Arduino and build upon it
-Our first time competing in a hackathon and we worked well together
-Functional Result
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -How to set up the Arduino components and power the LCD and Thermistor
-How to write out the core program in Python

                    We can start a business from this product once we improve it. We can extend this and use it to keep computers cool for a lower price than a more expensive central a/c!
