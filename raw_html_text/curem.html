                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After speaking with clinicians at Johns Hopkins Hospital, we found that the current standard of care for monitoring coumadin (an anticoagulant) at home is outdated. Even now, the main method of reporting is with fax. For such an important task (failure to monitor and report can increase the risk of toxicity/bleeding and even lead to death), we found it ridiculous that such an inefficient method with limited functionality was the standard of care.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Curem consists of two components: a mobile app designed for patients to record and report their data and a web  their latest INR levels. These are instantly plotted on a live graph that records that patients data over time so the user can understand if he/she is fluctuated significantly in INR levels. Daily reminders remind patients to test and record their data. The data is automatically sent to clinicians who can view the time series graph of INR. All data is secure and HIPPA compliant. Additionally, clinicians can manage multiple patients, quickly viewing and switching between different users. Most importantly, clinicians can give timely feedback to users on their data, quickly adjusting dosages and minimizing the risk of bleeding.
