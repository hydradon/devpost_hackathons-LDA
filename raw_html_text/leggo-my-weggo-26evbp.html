                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Weggo is also short for wegmans which we all &lt;3. I would like you to leggo of my weggo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows a screenshot of the Wegmans waffle store page (poor weggos got poor reviews). If you try to click on the page it gives you an alert box saying "leggo my weggo!!"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used nginx on a Google Cloud App Engine instance of debian and bought the domain off of _ domain.com _
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I also tried to host weggomyleggo.com on the same server but it didn't seem to work properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be difficult to tell the difference between lego and leggo
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Leggo My Weggo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If i can get weggomyleggo.com to work I might forward traffic between leggomyweggo.com and weggomyleggo.com in a beautiful loop much like the snake that eats its own tail Ouroboros.
