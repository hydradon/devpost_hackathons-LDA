                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personal experiences with obtaining a job in the industry. The societal pressure to succeed is felt by everyone in our generation.This leads to what we categorize as "Internal Harassment" (ex: blaming yourself, self-abuse, self-doubt). An overlooked area when compared to "External" harassments, but nonetheless an important issue to discuss.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a safe space with a small group of peers and a "counselor" . Lipht also takes a photo of you when you're feeling positive and is a reminder when you're feeling good for a later time when you're feeling under the weather.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporated Google's speech-to-text API, Google's Firebase backend, and Android's hardware camera API.
Programmed in Java, in the Android Studio environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Idea actually didn't come to us until 11am on sunday. 2 hours before the competition deadline.We scrapped what we were working on and started this. Not much hope, but yep, we did it.
All API'S used was a first to the members, getting the code to compile was an issue but with dedication and motivation we came out on top.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating foreign API's are more native to us.
                </p>

                    What's next for Lipht

                <p>
                    Anonymity in the group chat. More filters for the positive camera.
