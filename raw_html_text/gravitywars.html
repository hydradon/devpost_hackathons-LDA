                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A 2D space dogfighter with a fun little twist, we were going to try and implement some effects of general relativity by scaling up the players view as they approach a planet. Thus keeping the local speed for the player the same while slowing down the player relative other players. Plus some other affects of gravityh such as bullet curving etc.
                </p>

                    Nothing much at the moment, a placeholder png of the master sword flies around the screen shooting lasers. Which we guess is kinda cool.

                    How we built it

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us knew unity, which was a fairly big hurdle as we ended up having to find tutorials to learn off of that were concise enough to complete in an hour.
