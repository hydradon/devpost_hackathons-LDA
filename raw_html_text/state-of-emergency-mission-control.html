                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've volunteered during 2014 floods in Serbia. All of the social media organized events where either overcrowded or understaffed. The core issue was in the informational deprecation, as people tend to flock to the most visible event. 
 This ultimately leads to a decrease in motivation of volunteers.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Helps alleviate the informational deprecation in times of crises and takes pressure off of government controlled relief systems.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we're a team of different skill levels and stack preferences, we've decided not to go for the flashiest tool available, and went for a framework that allows us to develop applications rapidly. In this case we've decided to use Django.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution needs to be resilient, robust and accessible to people who are on the go, as well as possibly in an environment that makes lengthy engagements on social media inconvenient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's always a good idea to sync tools beforehand when working with a disparate team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for State of Emergency Mission Control
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There would be two failover levels to this that could do a lot more to improve the robustness by decentralizing the system itself by not relying on an internet connection.
