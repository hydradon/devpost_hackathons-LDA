                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Try to take a selfie with the rear camera... NOT EASY!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Point your back camera to your face and when it detects your face the app starts making a sound and when the face is completely centered it makes a different noise indicating the face is centered.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time difference of exactly 12 hours, Singapore to New York was a major factor.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app in less than 12 hours and some of it was done in a car on I-95 and the other was half drunk.

                <p>
                    Enable aut0matic photocapture seamlessly easing back selfie. Also make sure the size of the face isn't too large.
