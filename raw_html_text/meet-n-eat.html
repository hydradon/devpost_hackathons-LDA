                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day we wanted to eat in a restaurant but we weren&rsquo;t able to find any which suited all of our criteria. We realised that these problems manifest on a monthly/annual basis. We wanted to develop an app so that all of us could travel for equal amounts of time hence everyone put in the same &ldquo;effort&rdquo;. Our idea would maximise efficiency and utilise functionality in this century where everyone travels at a breakneck pace.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The iOS Application gives a platform for people to chat and to discuss their cuisine preferences. After they have done so, the Application then automatically suggests 3 of the best restaurants based on time to travel to that restaurant. Then it gives directions to each person to that restaurant.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google&rsquo;s Firebase to store all of the data for all of the groups. We used swift to make the iOS app. We split up the work each member did according to the tools they had available and the skills they possessed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were making an iOS app but only two of our members had a Mac. The others had a windows and iPad so splitting tasks was not very easy.
Only one of our team members was proficient in swift and even he wasn&rsquo;t very good.
Getting the data for all of our restaurants was not very easy and took many hours to supply.
After getting the data we had to transfer it over to the Firebase server and because the two members with macs were busy, one of our team member&rsquo;s had to do it by hand and that took another few hours.
Time management was an issue and splittting of tasks could have been done better.
