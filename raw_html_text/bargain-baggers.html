                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To good to go is already a popular and successful app. But it does leave features to be desired. The two main driving points for this project is;
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        As a consumer, you don't know what you are paying for. Those mystery bags ain't always that great.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a prosumer, you cannot predict how much extra food you will have to sell at a discount. It is selling the bears skin before it has been shot.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app will make it possible for stores to sell items or services at a discount in a very fast and effecient manner. It allows users to look through nearby offers, favorite stores and filters, and reserve interesting deals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reserving isn't permanent. As a consumer, you can promise to get the bargain before a specific time, and the app will let you know if you are too far away to make it within closing time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Android Studio, in java. We used firebase for the backend. The design and feel of the app was also designed by Lidia, the UX and UI designer, using Adobes products.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since most of the group haven't made an app before, we started with xamarin. It took about a day for us to realize how badly integrated firebase is with xamarin, and we switched to java. Most of us didn't know java, or the structure of and Android app, so this has been the biggest obstacle.
