                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I do a lot of event organizing and team leading. I learned over the years that slack can be one of the greatest bonding tools if used right. If the slack team has access to slack emoji's of team members, it allows for a lot more fun and playing around. The lightheartedness that comes with these simple emoji's can make a huge difference in the moral of a team. The issue, they're time consuming to make and I'm wayyy too busy to sit down and make them.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to take/choose photos from your phone and links you right to slack to upload them. Great for snapping silly shots of the team in action or making faces.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with a completely different idea, scrapped it and restarted with the expo demo source code near the beginning of the hackathon. Eventually I realized that my longtime dream of slack emoji's could be accomplished and rolled with the punches until I got there.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the punches came from integrating Expo with all the other technologies. I'm notoriously bad at APIs and thank the organizers there were so many genie-us mentors to grant me wishes to the Princess.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot with my monkey and carpet, but I'm most proud of the fact that I didn't give up after my first idea flopped, and kept pushing to get things done even when approaching mentors was unhelpful.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I may have finally learned express node servers. They were always a little challenging to me but Tanmaig and I did it real quick. Great hackathon to start the year!!
