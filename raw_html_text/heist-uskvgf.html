                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we wanted to do a simple type of game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    allows for user choices which affect overall outcome and choice probability
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    wrote dialogue and based conditional statements around the possible options
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting all the formatting correct was out biggest challenge, and it still is not perfect
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we made a code that did not crash and burn
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned that the more lines there are, the harder it is to follow. and that it is very useful to have a fallback patch if nothing works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Heist++
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to look into reformatting and making sure all options carry weight from choices
                </p>
