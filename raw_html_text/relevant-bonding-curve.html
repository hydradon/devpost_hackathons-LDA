                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bonded Curve Tokens have all sorts of applications but the details of building them are tricky. Relevant is a reputation based social news reader that plans on launching bonded tokens for different communities and rewarding participants via inflation built into those tokens. This is an especially tricky application of a bonding curve token so we wanted to make an easy to understand interface to help illuminate the use of this dynamic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product is a react component that can be included on a website or in an app. It allows you to test parameters of any bonded curve token as well as buy and sell from an already deployed bonded token contract.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The component was built with react and it was integrated into Relevant, also using react.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it was difficult building in an inflation model that had a fair balance between network participants and network investors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finally being able to easily buy and sell bonded tokens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web3 can often be fixed by turning your computer off and turning it back on again
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Educating current Relevant users on how to interact with the Bonded Curve Tokens, and extending the component for deploy from browser.
