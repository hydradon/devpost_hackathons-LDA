                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've walked into one too many coffee shops playing the same bad music over and over, and we want to introduce some real change into the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spkr allows you to optionally sign into a coffee shop WiFi via Spotify, and your music tastes will be taken into consideration to produce a curated playlist for the shop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it mostly using Python with Flask, and postgresql. The frontend was written with bootstrap and HTML/JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way Spotify handles authentication and playing of music was pretty challenging to deal with, as we've never written an application like this before, but we managed to beat the odds and deliver a working product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    (Sean) This was my first time working with postgresql, so getting that working was quite rewarding. In addition, having a finished product worthy of demo is also very rewarding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Sammy) Getting Spotify's API working smoothly with Python was difficult, but in the end, it worked out well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about OAuth and the Spotify API, using SQL in Python using SQlAlchemy, administrating a postgres instance, and using bootstrap for the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Spkr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is easily scalable, so we want to set up a public facing website to allow for anyone to sign up for the service.
                </p>
