                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Increased natural disasters are tearing communities down and the public needs to be informed and ready for relief efforts
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Show graphic datasets and infographics to inform about important but less covered topics on disasters
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Research open data and read published research papers, Javascript, React, C3.js, Venngage, InDesign
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deciding on a narrow enough topic that everyone on the team was happy with, making a well-formed plan for the project while trying to learn new technologies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having something that runs!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some React, different approaches to visualizing data and information, and we learned what sort of data sets are available on disaster relief and the state of that data quality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Disaster Guides
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The open data on this topic will take longer to transform and visualize but we want our website to eventually be more data-driven, although we already have good information from other's research. Also improving the functionality and UI of the website.
