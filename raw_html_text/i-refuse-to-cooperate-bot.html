                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even trivial task might pose a significant challenge when you are a robot. That is why it is important to learn to think like robots to make them learn think like humans (far-fetched but still kind-of true).

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simple line-follower - a robot that follows a track with the help of five infrared sensors that let him see the dark path before him.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using ArduC I implemented a simple PID controller (with only PD active) to make robot stay on track. In order to make as much sense from sensor readings I implemented auto-calibration method.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tuning PID is not as simple as it seems. Writing proper error and steering functions might be insanely helpful, but it is also tricky.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the robot actually cooperate with me and obey my will (to a limited extend).

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Controlling robots requires deep understanding of what it knows and what it needs to achieve.
