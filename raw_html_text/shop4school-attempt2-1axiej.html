                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teachers don't have enough time. Any tools to make their administrative duties less of a burden means more time for their students. Organizing, printing, and distributing back-to-school materials lists is a burden on teacher time and often results in sub-par allocation of resources. Additionally, we'd love to utilize this platform to enable crowd-sourced funding for students who would otherwise not be able to afford the class materials. With every checkout, the user will be prompted to donate an additional 10% toward school supplies for students of low-income families.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The shop4school app is designed to interface with Target.com to make it easy to create a back-to-school shopping list and then distribute the link to parents. In its eventual form, the site will allow teachers to build a supply list similar to how brides can build their registry. Once created, they can share their personalized link with their students and families, who can then checkout online or have their supplies shipped to store in a matter of clicks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html/css for the front-end. We used AJAX and javascript to make API requests to Target.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us have worked in javascript before or done anything with APIs. The entire exercise was a challenge because we had to learn everything on the fly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to pull data from the API and display it in a page that looks nice and has important functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned we have a lot more to learn, but also that with focus you can make significant strides in a short amount of time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It depends on whether the Target team likes the idea.
