                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While studying for the physics GRE this past fall, I noticed that there weren't many resources available to students aside from these four former tests. I wanted to see if it would be possible to make these tests more helpful to the students studying witht hem.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Acts as an aide (along with the downloadable/printable tests) to students who are currently studying using the four released practice exams for the PGRE. It can serve as a diagnostic for students who are just starting to study, or a quick way to check answers and see what areas need improvement. It tracks how long a student takes on a given question as well as helping the student determine their weak points and strengths.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using python.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first the goal was to include the entire questions from the exams in the program itself, however this quickly caused trouble as often diagrams are needed that are difficult to explain through words only.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to find  a work-around for several challenges, most notably difficulty defining what type of question each problem was on the exam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot more about the nuances of python, and about arrays in particular.

                <p>
                    Look out for future releases of practice exams, as well as improving diagnostic outputs.
