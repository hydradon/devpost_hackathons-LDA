                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to learn OpenCV for robot vision processing and use the Jetson TX1 from NVIDIA for our 2017 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) robot.
We came up with projects for the Jetson, one of which was facial recognition for scanning in and out of our robotics lab. We thought this hackathon would be a good opportunity to finish most of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Does facial detection and recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C++, OpenCV, and QT.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting path of XML files, linking OpenCV libraries with QT widget, understanding facial recognition algorithms, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trained a LBPH facial recognition classifier and got the GUI to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use OpenCV and QT. Also, we learned how machine learning works for facial recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Facial Recognition
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to finish the widget and get our algorithm connected with the GUI. We also wish to train the classifier better and run it with all 85 members of our robotics team.
