                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I was in high school, my gym teacher read out a phone number for the class and said &ldquo;This is the direct number of our local emergency dispatcher. This will save 1-2 minutes vs dialing 911, put this in speed dial on your cell phone.&rdquo; Nobody put it in their phones. If there&rsquo;s a faster way to get medical help than calling 911, why don&rsquo;t we use that instead?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on your location (automatically loaded from your phone) the app searches for your nearest emergency dispatcher to save precious minutes while a 911 call would route your emergency to the right place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote a mobile app in React Native and connected it to Google Maps&rsquo; API to find the phone&rsquo;s location and to automatically search for your nearest emergency dispatcher. A Python backend with a Flask proxy communicates with the React Native frontend to provide the number of the emergency dispatcher and call it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the front-end and the back-end was a difficult and unexpected challenge, but very rewarding once we cracked it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First full-stack application for all of the team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The members of the team working on front end were also learning JavaScript and React for the first time, and they learned a very useful language and skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emergency Fastrack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to integrate text-to-voice in case the user is not in a situation where they can speak to the dispatcher as well as automatically sending their GPS location for faster reaction time
