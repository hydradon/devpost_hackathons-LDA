                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As hackathon goers, we want to capture the Hackathon awesomeness with our hack and, this time, we decided to do so by making a language for it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It converts your code to M.JS.IO, which can be run later, as well as converts the BlackRock API to our language and utilizes Twilio to send a SMS message with the M.JS.IO code that sent it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Converting the six characters in JSF*** to "M", "HACK", ...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half our team ditched us during MHacks so this is what we had come up with during the last day
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually completing a hackathon project to the point of being able to say "I've done something appreciable"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Replacing characters with words makes things so much cooler
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for M.JS.IO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make appearances at future hackathons but with the theme of those hackathons instead (Penn.JS.IO, etc.)
                </p>
