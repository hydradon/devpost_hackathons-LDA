                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always wanted a way to teach my niece and nephew coding. While there are many options out there that do this, most of them rely on just a PC. From my experience, my niece and nephew seem more interested in seeing physical objects being controlled rather than just some images or text on a screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application explains the basics of coding while also allowing the student to enter code to control the LED ring. The application with take them through it step by step. The student will be able to enter commands and watch the effects it has on the LED ring.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote an Arduino script that controls the LED ring and also receives commands from a Python script on the PC. In addition I also wrote two more Python scripts, one that interprets the commands the user enters and one that presents the GUI and feeds data to the interpreter. The interpreter takes the users commands and uses the Arduino script to execute them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never tried to control the Arduino using an external application so that was something new for me. I was researching options using Java but was told by someone else to look into Python. After some research I found a good library. This worked perfectly after some struggle learning to use it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the fact that I was able to get the application to control the Arduino. And I am also proud that I was able to finish this project in manner that is close to how I envisioned it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I was able to come up with an idea, learn what I needed to implement it, and then code it. I also learned a new skill, controlling an Arduino with an external application, that I can use in future projects.
                </p>

                    I plan to try to develop a it little further and try it out with m niece and nephew.
