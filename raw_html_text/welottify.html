                    Blockchain needs a Killer App to attract the average soccer mom. We need a Teaching Moment. Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, adoption has been slow. Recently, much of it has been driven by greed and FOMO. Money and gambling have been the core motivation. In fact, gambling accounts for more than 50% of bitcoin transactions.
                    <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-gamblers-wagered-4-5-billion-btc-2014/" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    This has spawned countless casinos and lottery services on the blockchain. However, they have struggled with issues regarding how the winning numbers are generated and payouts structure.

                <p>
                    There's a better way or at least an alternative. How about the Powerball Jackpot? Here's some interesting numbers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        70% players have income &gt;$75k while 30% have income $45k-$75k

                        In fact, AutoLotto's group lottery (centralized) service has just raised $17 million to move forward.
                        <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170710005455/en/AutoLotto-Raises-17-Million-Series-Funding-Lottery" rel="nofollow">

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WeLottify wants to help anyone manage Powerball group lottery on the blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, small groups play lottery together without much of a legal framework. There are plenty of sample paper contracts online that can help groups operate better. However, once someone wins the jackpot, lawsuits are not uncommon. There is a better way to do this using Smart Contracts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here&rsquo;s how it works:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        User creates a Pool by entering details like Name, Lottery (Powerball for now), Drawing Date, Number of Players, Service Fees, and select Public/Private
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User becomes the Leader to buy the lottery tickets
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Smart Contracts set a few timed conditions like group closed and upload Proofs time limit
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each player can join by committing the Ticket + Fee amount via Bitcoin to be held in escrow
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the number of players is reached before the closed time, the Fund is released to the Leader
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Leader has 24 hrs to buy tickets and upload photos of Proofs to the blockchain like receipts, signed ticket front / back, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the drawing date, the Leader has the responsibility to claim the prize money and distribute equally to the group via bitcoin
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    How it's different than existing blockchain lottery:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        by using existing lotteries, more people will understand it and more players will join because of the size of the jackpot from day one
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        by empowering existing groups to operate on their own, the risk is greatly lower as more consumers learn about the blockchain
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Initially, we envision that WeLottify will be used in small local circles among family, friends, and co-workers where there&rsquo;s already a high level of trust. As identity becomes better with more ways to validate them via verifiable claims etc, WeLottify can become a global phenomenon. Anyone in the world can play with peace of mind.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created solidity smart contracts to manage the parameters of a group lottery.
Used Web3 to interact with the contract and make transactions.
Used MetaMask as identity.
IPFS is used for storing the Proof - tickets
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lottery is time sensitive. It's tricky to calculate the right time to close the pool, time for leader to upload the proof, and payouts. Another issue is the validation of the proof to release escrow to the leader. This will have to be done manually initially by WeLottify to ensure smooth operations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Identity and Reputation are important in the blockchain world. There will be a lot of efforts to help validate identity and work with partners like Civic and uPort to build federated identity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeLottify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Why this is great for blockchain:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        This is a great teaching moment for blockchain as more people will share among their networks and educate each other on identity and bitcoin
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This can increase the market cap of Bitcoin as large winnings are distributed. Imagine a Jackpot of $375 million being converted into BTC.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is an opportunity for wealth redistribution to help those in poverty as anyone can reap the monetary benefits of a first-world lottery. WeLottify wants to shake the world with the first-ever Powerball jackpot won using blockchain.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, there are many ways to make this better. On one hand, WeLottify will continue to improve trust by building user reputation with better identity and proof validations. On the other hand, WeLottify can make the game more fun and persuasive. Here are some ideas:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        expand to more lottery like MegaMillion, EuroMillion, etc
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        in addition to Leader, allow Buyer where user / group can hire them to buy tickets and mail it. Powerball allows anyone to play. They just have to have possession of the real ticket.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        create ways for players to pick numbers
                    </li>
                </ul>
