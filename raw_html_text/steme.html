                    The United States has an increasing demand for STEM majors. Unfortunately, many Americans do not have the opportunity to be introduced to STEM in high school or college. Women, African-Americans, and latinos are extremely underrepresented in those majors.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced many challenges to send information from the front end, which was stored locally, and the backend, which was stored at Google APP engine.
