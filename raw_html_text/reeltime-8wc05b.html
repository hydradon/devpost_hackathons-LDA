                    Inspired by our mutual suffering through minimum wage jobs, our team created an app that would allow employees to view their earnings increase in live time! This project is currently run using python and we have included an ideal mockup using Adobe Experience Design. Ideally, this would be able to stream via a widget on your phone and is accessible through web pages using Flask.

                    At the end of each clock-in, the app will ask you a short question on how your shift was that week. Mental health is huge when it comes to working -- especially when you are a part-time student or working long hours. Ideally, these employee wellness reports would be anonymous and sent to the employer. Therefore the company can get a good grasp on the wellbeing of their employees.

                    Our team struggled with MongoDB and Flask in order to create a reliable database and an online UI for convenient app usage. Ideally in the future, these aspects would be further fleshed out and created in order to have a more accessible and easier to use UI.
