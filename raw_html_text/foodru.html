                    We understand the struggle that students, especially student-atheletes go through to buy the basic necessities such as food. Restaurants also tend to throw a way a lot of food at the end of the day, which ends up just going to waste, since they cannot meet their quota of cooked food. Our app allows them to hold a flash sale where students may buy food at considerable discounts, allowing the business to keep more money and feed these starving students. We initially faced some challenges using Firebase, but found that Parse worked well for storing our deals and restaurants data. For the future, we plan to include map integration for finding restaurants based on proximity anywhere around the country. We hope to improve the food situation for many students through the innovation of this app, while also reducing the amount of waste we produce as a country.
