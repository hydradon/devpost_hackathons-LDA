                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to get a definitive and straightforward answer, you have to use third party websites such as NameCheap.com to see if a domain name is available to purchase. Just because a domain can't be found doesn't necessarily mean it isn't taken (e.g. crazymonkey.com).
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I thought, why not cut out the middleman and just list on the domain itself if it's available or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I felt that there was a lack of websites providing accurate information specifically about their domain's availability.  With that in mind, I was compelled to create a website that does just that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website tells you if it's domain name is available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML and CSS.  Shoutout to Khan Academy for teaching me that stuff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with a design that was simple yet elegant was quite challenging.  Many websites have an interactive user interface, but adding such design features would clutter the web page and detract from the website's authority.  Also, the color composition of the background was quite diverse and contrasting, so finding the right text color was perplexing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only does this website tell you if it's domain is available, but in the unfortunate case that it isn't available, it will suggest to you another domain to see if that's available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vertically aligning stuff is hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for IsThisDomainAvaiable.com
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will try to find a better-looking person for the background of the website.  Right now it's just a picture of me, so there is much room for improvement.
