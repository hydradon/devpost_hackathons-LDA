                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original idea was to help parents keep their children from swearing, especially in the home.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SwearBot is an interactive smart swear jar designed to keep you and your children honest! SwearBot detects selected "no-no" words when someone curses aloud and keeps track of the number of swears in the day. At the end of the day, you can review this number and opt to donate that much money to charity at the end of the day.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a raspberry-pi to record everyday conversation using a microphone and call the Rev-ai speech-to-text service to send back a transcript of what was said throughout the day.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were all beginners at Web Development, so we all started from scratch. We attempted to make this compatible with GoogleMini and Amazon Echo, but there were functionalities of each that we couldn't control, so we decided to make our own device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of getting the APi to sync up with the front end of our program. This took a while to get together and we're proud we actually got it done.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Web Development and we hope to keep learning about it! We also learned about

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve the charity connections later on. We want the accountability and risk factor to increase to raise the stakes for our client and make our product more productive.
