                <p>
                    When we were traveling internationally, it was very difficult to get directions without incurring data charges.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web application: The website is hosted on AWS S3 static website fronted by Cloudfront content delivery, and Route53 for DNS, with domains provided by Radix. The calls are handled by customer browser js. The integration of the services was the major challenge. 
Mobile application: Mobile application is directly handled by Twilio. Backend calls are currently made to Mapquest APIs. The integration of the services and patching together multiple lambda calls was the biggest challenge.
