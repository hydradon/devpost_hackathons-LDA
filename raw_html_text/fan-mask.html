                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed many lovers of sports and people who want to express their fanaticism or belongingness to a country usually painted their faces in colours the country's flag. Being conscious that the chemicals used on their faces could be harmful to them, we got inspired to use augmented reality to give the user the sensation of having a painted look.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FanMask tracks the user's face and puts on it an effect of a painted look in the colour of a country's flag with the country's name at the top of the screen. The user can switch from one country's effect to the another by a tap on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the SparkAr studio, we added a face tracker to the scene. To the face tracker, we said 10 face meshes with 10 different textures corresponding to the 10 countries we selected for the purpose of the challenge. Alongside the face meshes, we included canvas and 2D text corresponding to the names of the various countries. To enable the variation from one face mesh to the other using screen tap, made a connection of a series of patches. We linked the output of a "screen tap" patch to a "counter"( from 0 to maximum count 10), then to  10 "equals exactly" patches. We made a "visible" patch for each face mesh and made a one-to-one mapping of each of them to the outputs of the "equals exactly" patches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge was to get used to the spark ar studio, most notably with the patches but that was facilitated thanks to the facilitators we had at the build days. The second challenge was that of finding the time suitable to all team members to hold meetings for the advancement of the project.The third as that of having our effect approved early by facebook for submission before the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ere glad that all those who could test the effect were glad and amazed by the work we accomplished. We met some people who had the habit of putting those chemicals on their faces, and they were impressed and said they would result in our solution when they want pictures during matches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got quite familiar with the spark ar studio. We learned the usage of face trackers, plan trackers, segmentation, and how to use some interaction such as mouth open, screen tap and many others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FAN MASK
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We look forward to adding more countries to the effect package. Eventually, we would be checking how much more people get interested in the effect before releasing version for soccer clubs.
