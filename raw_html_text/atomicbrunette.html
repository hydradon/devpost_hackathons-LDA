                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Atomic Blonde movie (2017). Charlize Theron plays a spy who navigates other countries using seamless language skills and other such espionage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is an Oculus Touch game that takes you through spy scenarios to help you practice language learning. You play as Agent Brunette who is sent on missions to other countries. You have to extract information from locals while speaking in their primary language. The better you do speaking their language, the better your chances of convincing them you aren't a spy and thus, extracting the information. But if you don't speak the language properly, you'll risk getting exposed and fail the mission.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built with blood, sweat, tears, and love. Our team spent approximately 32 hours together, with short stints of sleep (maybe 6 hours total, over two days).

                <p>
                    Only two people on the team had used Unity before    o_o
                    <br>
                    GIT GIT GIT - Did we mention GIT? More time was spent fixing version syncing issues than playing with puppies. An imbalance we never want to experience again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are so proud of all the work we did together. We had an excellent sound guy who brought realism into our environments. We worked with a Rosetta Stone API to measure how well users spoke these others languages. Getting that working with Unity was a challenge that was satisfying to finally get accomplished.
