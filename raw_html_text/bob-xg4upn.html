                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Back in the 90's, Tamagotchi was a huge trend. Everybody was obsessed with the game. People would stay glued to their pets for hours in order to keep them alive. So we thought, what if the goal was not to keep them alive, but to help them die as many times as possible?
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's how Bob was born.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bob is an ancient and powerful creature. However, back in his days, Bob has been slain by an even more powerful Hero. Bob has been reborn as a simple blob, with no powers whatsoever, but his desire to get revenge burns stronger with every day. He needs to live through as many lives as possible in order to get an infinite knowledge and finally get his revenge on the Hero.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After all, curiosity killed a cat, but infinite knowledge brought it back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Bob" is a terminal game. You can interact with Bob and help him live as many fulfilling lives as possible. You will see Bob die a lot, but no need to shed even a single tear. Bob will be reborn after each death until he gets enough knowledge to get infinite power to slay the Hero!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used C++ and ncurses library (which was first developed in the 90's!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time using ncurses
We realized we didn't know C++ as much as we thought we did
Makefiles were confusing at first
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building our first terminal game
Learning more about how C++ works (much more than we learned in the classroom)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More deep dark, dark deep stuff about C++, how to do Makefiles like a pro,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bob
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add more interactions
-&gt; Animations
-&gt; Restart Bob's life cycle once he dies
-&gt; Make an endgame
-&gt; Add backstory in the game
