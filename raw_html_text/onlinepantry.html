                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always forget the food I have at home and when certain products expire. With the varying ingredients at home it doesn't seem like there is anything to make and this leads to food waste and spending money eating out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now I could not add a lot of functionality I wanted but it has a simple and engaging UI for users to check the pantry page and favorite recipes page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I designed the html pages and the css to go with it. I used Mongodb stitch to connect it to a backend and a database.

                    I was trying to figure out how to work with Mongodb stitch

                <p>
                    I want to continue working on it and actually allow users to select the ingredients they have at home and suggest recipes that go with the ingredients. The users will also be able to sort items by expiration type and various cuisines. The website (eventually an app) will also be to notify users that they are running low on some items and also how their saved recipes align with their fitness goals.
