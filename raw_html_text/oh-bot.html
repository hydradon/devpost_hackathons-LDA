                <p>
                    Our software engineering team had a lot of random interrupts. These interrupts caused  context switching and stress. We decided to implement 'office hours' to control the interrupt problem. It became apparent that an office hours bot would be a great tool to help us organize and manage our team's office hours!

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our company uses Slack so I started with creating a Slack app/bot and then connected it to our Amazon Lex bot. Basically, started with 1 intent at a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it hard to collaborate on the Lex configurations since most of it is done via the web interface. Importing and exporting Lex configurations is limited to JSON and AWS API//cli. It would be great to see it support Yaml . Also keeping track of what has changed between the different 'intent' and 'slot' versions can cause confusion. One huge problem was how to get more event data from Slack into Lex 
(Like which Slack user is interacting with the bot).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, we found the error messaging for Lex could be misleading or non-informative.

                <p>
                    Implemented with clean and simple Lambda functions and Dynamodb. Totally serverless :)

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Lex and a few new things about Slack! Also, this was the first time I implemented an application that used Dynamodb.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to add some reporting outputs to help teams better understand what types of questions they are getting at office hours so they can adjust to meet the needs of those they support.
                </p>
