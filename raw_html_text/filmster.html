                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The rapid growth of video streaming services poses a financial conundrum when choosing what streaming service to invest your money in.

                    With a simple search, Filmster will display which streaming services a given TV shows and movies are available on. This will help inform your choices of which services to pay and subscribe for.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we used our background knowledge in Python to create web-scrapers that obtained the titles of three major Canadian streaming platforms and stored this data in dictionaries for each respective platform. The backend was written in Python and the frontend was written in Javascript using a Bootstrap template. In order to send information from the frontend to the backend and vice versa, we had to create a server using a Flask web app. We sent post requests we used Ajax to call on request and responses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For one, there was a learning curve as we are all beginners and we did not have the knowledge to flesh out the idea completely and ran out of time. In the end, all three components worked independantly, however, we're unable to get them working together within the time limit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned so much and made so many friends. Stepping out of our comfort zone by using different platforms and new languages was a great personal victory. By working together, we were able to use 5 different platforms/languages efficiently and given more time, believe we could have created a great application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perseverance and teamwork in unfamiliar territory!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Filmster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to add a function to the website that allowed you to enter multiple tv shows/movies and evaluate their price eventually having an algorithm that suggests your preferred platform.
