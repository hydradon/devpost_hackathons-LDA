                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Residential windows are dumb, don't connect to the internet, and are a massively overlooked part of energy efficiency and home comfort.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Measures the value proposition of using windows to passively control temperature in the house.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python if statements and coffee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding good temperature data and making the window behavior realistic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UX/UI design of the app is really slick and simple, and the value proposition of passively controlling temperature is real.
                </p>
