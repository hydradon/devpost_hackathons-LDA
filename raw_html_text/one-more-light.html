                        Who cares if one more light goes out in the sky of a million stars?
                        <br>
                        It flickers, flickers

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Collect falling stars to help light up your friend who is struggling.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With much love and patience and a little bit of boba.  We used a C++ code base with SDL to display the graphics and Corel Painter to create the graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some aspects like the progress bar required a workaround, as we were not able to find an appropriate scaling function in the SDL library. Animating the final sequence was also challenging - we partially died.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working game!  The graphics are original and set the tone of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The kind of efficient and constructive communication between artist and developer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for One More Light
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Potentially allowing the user to select which player they want to play as.  Adding bigger stars to make it more of a challenge to catch them all.  Adding levels that the user can select from.  Adding a small start menu and intro sequence.
