                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to allows users to take better control over their finances.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presents a heat map of the location of user's purchases, allowing the user to see when the purchases are made. The data visualization helps the user to understand where, when and how much was purchased, to learn patterns and possible areas that could help one save money.

                    The voice control allows for hands-free and fuss-free communication with the app, as a proof of concept of the way we interact with software in the future.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used CapitalOne APIs for the financial data at the backend. We used Javascript and AngularJS to build the front end. Data processing was performed in Python. And Visualization was done in Tableau.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use the Amazon Echo's voice API to power our website and financial analysis but it required an approval from Amazon in order to run our app on the Echo.
