                    Inspiration: Missing Link is for people who don't have a clear vision of what an engineer really is. It is also for people who don't feel like they fit in the mold of an engineer.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It connects individuals with people with similar backgrounds, and help them to be inspired, pursue similar careers, as well as providing resources.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: Webflow, search engine twitter widget.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Make the design match our purposes, with a pleasant appearance while transmitting our message we want to pass.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: It will help people feel like they actually fit in industry, breaking concerns of what they should look like to fit in the fake mold of what an engineer should be or look. It is a bridge for connections with similar individuals and a confirmation we are not alone in this journey and we all fit. Because we all are the representation of what an engineer looks like.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: The importance of design to transmit a message for an audience, collaboration, and getting to know people deeper through the interviews we've made.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Missing Link: interview more people with the goal of motivating more and more engineers, or engineers-to-be.
