                </h2>
                <p>
                    After working with a therapist in Texas, our team member ,Erin, learned about wellness plans. A wellness plan will help you recover when things aren't going so well and stay happy when they are. Knowing that you really like your aunt's macaroni and cheese, or Cyndi Lauper's

                    makes you happy will help you figure out what can help you persist in a time of crisis. Persist will ensure these things happen so you don't have to.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    After an initial setup with our quick and easy form, you can tell Persist what makes you happy and when you'd like a pick-me-up. Persist than takes this from an output CSV file and decides whether it needs to set reminders or interact with another system. Persist may try anything from playing your favorite song to showing a picture of your last family vacation in the effort to get you happy again.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent a long time working on creating the form and databases on google cloud services, but the mockup was best for presenting at the demo. The mockup was made with HTML and CSS, and then enhanced with Figma. The Google Assistant and Google Home portions were made with the google assistant GUI and dialogue API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult setting up MySQL the first time, so Erin spent a lot of time on it. Setting up Django and overcoming its learning curve was also very difficult. However, once it was set up, there wasn't much time left to integrate into the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amanda learned HTML and CSS at this hackathon and this project was her first HTML/CSS project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leonardo had a hard time trying to find the right kind of file to use for the google assistant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Xilei had trouble finding the API with the functionality he wanted. Once he did settle on dialogue flow, he had trouble understanding the documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To that point, everyone on the team had trouble with vague or outdated documentation.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Erin set up a MySQL database and Django on google's app manager for the first time! She spent weeks trying to figure it out on her computer but managed to put it on a remote server in a couple of hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amanda made her first webpage using HTML/CSS and learned how to use Figma for UX design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Xilei accomplished set the music and reminder functions of Dialogflow and combined them into the agent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leonardo created his first conversational response with google home.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Erin learned how to use google cloud services to set up MySQL and Django. She also learned how to work with a mentor on a coding project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amanda learned HTML which she found super different from Python and is excited to use it to make digital products that are both functional and pretty. She also learned how to communicate with tech terms clearly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Xilei learned how to use Google Dialogflow to build our own "Google Assistant".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leonardo learned Google Dialogflow

                    What's next for Persist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the Future, Persist would be able to interact with more elements of the home. This interaction would include smart lights, smartTV, and google assistant partner apps. Persist would include better recognition of immediate crisis and provision of the correct resources.
