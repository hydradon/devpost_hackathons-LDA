                <p>
                    LifeLine is an app that enables users to circumvent the complicated healthcare system regarding the organ donation system. We may only see the negatives in society, but there are strangers everywhere willing to donate an organ to save a life. We utilize this very generosity to help save people&rsquo;s lives. Every year, there are thousands of people on organ donation lists that never receive a transplant. With this app, we can help change that.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode and firebase.
