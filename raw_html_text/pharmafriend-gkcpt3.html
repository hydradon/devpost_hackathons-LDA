                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After hearing about the high overdose rates in British Columbia, our team began thinking about the adverse effects of drugs and their ability to inflict serious harm. We decided to focus on over-the-counter drugs to combat the widespread misconception that said drugs are benign.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PharmaFriend is a chat-bot based application in which users can monitor their use of OTC drugs. Users have the ability to add, remove, and be informed of high risk medications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was built using both front-end and back-end development. XML and Java were used to develop the user interface. In terms of the brains behind the software, REST APIs and Firebase was used to determine the hazards of drug combinations chosen by the user and to store patient information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the technologies and APIs we used were ones we were unfamiliar with. Faced with a steep learning curve and a tight schedule, mistakes were made along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of our integration of four APIs to create a chat-bot-based app that provides users with an exceptional user experience that is both efficient and reliable. We believe that the safety of the consumer is a priority and are proud that our app aids in the protection of their health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond the experience gained in the various technologies we used, we were also faced with the importance of remaining level-headed in spite of the deadlines and lack of sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PharmaFriend
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, PharmaFriend will be integrated with Android Pay making purchasing over-the-counter drugs more safer and easier than they have ever been before. Additionally, PharmaFriend will be able to suggest drugs that may be appropriate for the user based on his medical history and current list of medications. Lastly, the app will allow users to learn about the drugs they are purchasing by simply scanning the barcode on their packaging.
