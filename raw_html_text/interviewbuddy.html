                    Inspiration: As a team of freshman, sophomore and junior college students, we realized that we lacked a free tool that could help us study for technical and business case interviews under a timed environment.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: InterviewBuddy is a fast-paced skill drill designed to prepare students for technical and business case interviews under real-time conditions. It is a web application
                </h2>
                <p>
                    built to help students study more efficiently by providing a test bank of problems
collected from various online websites and books. The users selects the area they want to focus on (currently we offer only three choice: computer science, business or combination of both) and the time length they wish to practice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We mainly used HTML for the markup, CSS for styling, and Javascript for interactivity.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we faced: Most of the team were not familiar with JavaScript, which was our main challenge during the hackathon. Our team also had little experience in project management, so we faced difficulties in managing our time and estimating how much time certain features would take to complete.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Learning JavaScript in less than 24 hours and applying it to something meaningful
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: How to make a countdown timer using JavaScript, when and when not to use database servers, how to properly use Bit Bucket and Github
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for InterviewBuddy: The next step for InterviewBuddy would be to continue to upgrade our current features. We would like to integrate video interviewing into our platform that would allow the user get a feedback on his performance. The user would record a video under the time given, which would later be evaluated by someone experienced.
