                    The three of us come from different backgrounds. Anne is from computer science, Tasnim has a strong background in robotics, and Faye is a medical science student. We decided to collaborate and put our skills together to create a health-care, software developing, and hardware hacking project!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we intended for HomeCare to do is to allow users to create profiles for themselves on the web application, giving them a visual representation of the system which scans their pulse, and temperature to test if they are healthy and in a great condition!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The Web application is built with Angular, which is a web development framework that uses Typescript, HTML and CSS. We also used Firebase as a database to hold user information and hosted the application with it as well. As for the hardware component, we used an Arduino, a temperature sensor and a vibration sensor that checks heart-rate.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Turns out we needed an ESP 8266 to send and receive data to Firebase as the Arduino doesn't have Wifi! Unfortunately we weren't able to get one and we ran out of time. We weren't able to put project together, however we would still like to demo what we have so far. Next time we will research the hardware before we start to ensure this doesn't happen again!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I am proud that we worked together and stayed up until the deadline. We tried our best and learn a lot from the experience!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I learned how to use Firebase as a database and to host my applications! I also learned a lot about Angular and how the framework works!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Next, we want to use an ESP 8266 to allow the Arduino to send requests to the database so the front end and the back-end can communicate! Also, we would like to improve UI/UX of the front end and make it look more clean.
