                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Back then, I always enjoy watching football or basketball live together with my friends. We would be able to comment and cheers together during the game. However, I moved to another city and ever since, its been hard for me to watch sports game together with my friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the VR technology, I decided to build a Social Sports VR which is a social VR platform that allows you to watch sports together with your friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does it work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app will let you to invite any friends you want to watch sports together with. You can choose any venues to watch sport and you can choose what kind of sports game you would like to watch with you friends. Also you will be able to watch the highlight of the games and the analytics of the game as well. You would be able to talk with your friends using VOIP technologies. The best part is you can choose to be any avatar you want as well.
