                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personally it's hard to differentiate between different types of trash. Students have a hard time choosing where to throw their trash away.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app takes picture of garbage and tells you if it is trash or recycling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was built with python-flask for the backend and react-native for the frontend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges connecting the frontend and backend and also how we would classify trash betwee garbage and recycling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of being able to implement the frontend in the short amount of time we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned alot more about react-native and its picture taking capabilities and how to use ngrok to tunnel our server so that our app can talk to it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for garbage filter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Garbage filter, as of right now cannot differentiate compost from recycling or trash and it has a poor performance on taking the photos of trash and classifying it. So the next step would be to improve the machine learning aspect of the project.
