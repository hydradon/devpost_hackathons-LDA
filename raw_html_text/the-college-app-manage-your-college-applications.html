                    Inspiration: I am a rising senior and I'm already overwhelmed with college applications. Each school has different requirements, and it is a lot to keep track of, so that's why I designed an app to help seniors manage their applications according to each school.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: The College App is organized according to a student's college list. They can input the tasks they need to complete for each college application and help manage the process on their phone.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I built the app using xcode and swift, and I also implemented firebase.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: I ran into problems understanding how to use firebase and how to organize the app itself. I struggled a little bit understanding how to implement object oriented programming into this app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I was really proud that I was able to understand how to use object oriented programming in this app, and that I was able to make a fully functioning app. I conquered autolayout and constraints and I was able to implement Firebase into this app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: I learned how to make my own app. I also learned a lot about apis and how to use them. I also learned how to implement Firebase into my apps and good app organization.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The College App - Manage Your College Applications: My app is far from complete. I want to add notifications to the app, as well as a calendar feature. I also want to find a college api in which they can get information about the colleges and then add that to their college list.
