                    This project fulfills two separate challenges -- the Marine Corps challenge and the Twilio API challenge. Marine supervisors constantly have tasks for the Marines to do, but it's often difficult to keep track of all of these tasks. MCTMA, or Marine Corps Task Management App, makes it easy for them to create and respond to tasks via a simple web interface for the supervisor and an Android app for the Marines. In addition, we calculate a score for each member using factors such as the number of tasks completed on time, and we rank the Marines based on these scores to provide an incentive for them to work harder.
