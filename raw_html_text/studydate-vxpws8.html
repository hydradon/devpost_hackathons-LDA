                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In large lectures, students often have difficulty making friends and forming study groups due to the social anxieties attached to reaching out for help. Collaboration reinforces and heightens learning, so we sought to encourage students to work together and learn from each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StudyDate is a personalized learning platform that assesses a user's current knowledge on a certain subject, and personalizes the lessons to cover their weaknesses. StudyDate also utilizes Facebook's Graph API to connect users with Facebook friends whose knowledge complement each other to promote mentorship and enhanced learning.
Moreover, StudyDate recommends and connects individuals together based on academic interests and past experience. Users can either study courses of interest online, share notes, chat with others online, or opt to meet in-person with others nearby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our front-end in React.js and used node.js for RESTful requests to the database, Then, we integrated our web application with Facebook's API for authentication and Graph API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges in persisting the state of Facebook authentication, and utilizing Facebook's Graph API to extract and recommend Facebook friends by matching with saved user data to discover friends with complementing knowledge. We also ran into challenges setting up the back-end infrastructure on Google Cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having built a functional, dynamic website that incorporates various aspects of profile and course information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about implementing various functionalities of React.js such as page navigation and chat messages.
Completing this project also taught us about certain limitations, especially those dealing with using graphics. We also learned how to implement a login flow with Facebook API to store/pull user information from a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StudyDate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to perform a Graph Representation of every user's knowledge base within a certain course subject and use a Machine Learning algorithm to better personalize lessons, as well as to better recommend Facebook friends or new friends in order to help users find friends/mentors who are experienced in same course. We also see StudyDate as a mobile application in the future with a dating app-like interface that allows users to select other students they are interested in working with.
