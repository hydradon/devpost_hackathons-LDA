                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an application for an IOT smart home. Our application doesn't only provide a luxury, taking one less task out of your knightly routine. It makes people safer in their homes. If there is a suspicious figure outside, one can lock all doors quickly and simultaneously. If there is a home intruder, unlocking all the doors and windows can make for a cleaner escape.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Via an Alexa Skill, one can utter a command and seconds later all the locks in your the will open or close accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Juan spear headed the Alexa Skill.
Michale engineered the back end webserver.
Victoria lead the front end web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many many challenges. Getting Alexa to connect to our server was the last hurddle to be overcome.

                    A big team-building moment for our team was when Alexa decided she was ready to connect to the internet.
