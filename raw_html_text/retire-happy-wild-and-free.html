                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often hire a financial advisor and pay huge amounts of money. We thought that what if a chatbot could do it for you real quick on the go. It saves you both time and money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Chatbot will ask you about your financial plans.
Based on your bank transactions and income, the chatbot will suggest you the amount of money to save per month in order to reach your goal in the required time-frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used NLTK and classifiers to classify the transactions into categories. We gained some insights and performed financial calculations in Numpy to give you the saving amount.
A Dashboard was created in JavaScript and to visualize the expenditure patterns of the user.
Based on the user's goals and tenure, a saving amount is suggested.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making API calls with the Google Home Mini. Dataset is also an issue, as bank transactions are private data.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a semi-synthetic dataset, visualizing and talking to the user is not an easy task in a day. We're proud of what we created.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
