                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was inspired by the difficulties experienced by recent arrivals in Australia with conventional English classes. Community English classes are not necessarily appropriate for the varying level of competencies of this group. The community does however have many enthusiastic volunteer English tutors, and our product aims to bridge the gap between these two groups.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a much in-depth understanding of challenges that refugees and asylum seekers face in their initial learning experiences. We recognise that migrants lose motivation to learn English when faced with the stereotyping experienced on arrival into a new community. Our solution hopes to assist with the students building confidence in approaching such a service and hopes to raise awareness within the community that such a service is beneficial in the broader sense.
