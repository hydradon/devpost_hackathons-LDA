                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking a hike somewhere in the Scottish highlands might leave you without an mobile internet connection; but how do you check your stock prices? Or the weather tomorrow? What if you're roaming abroad and want to find the nearest Starbucks ? You don't want to spend a fortune on those few megabytes... With SMService you can get all this information with the service available almost anywhere in the world - sms messaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a mobile app which uses sms messages to get data you need
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    App is designed to be fully extensible with various plugins,  we're bundling an HTML5 offline web app within a mobile application and extending the functionality with native code. The server uses django which is a python framework. Twilio service handles the data transitions between app and the server, and server uses other APIs to produce responses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of integration problems. Every android device behaved differently with the APIs we are using which proved to be a difficult challenge to build on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have an almost working demo version.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating is hard, also we learn some new API's
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SMService
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to fully finish the project; more plugins.
