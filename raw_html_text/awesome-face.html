                    At some point in our lives, we want to look good. We look in the mirror and want to make changes to our appearance, but we do not know where to start. Not everyone is a fashion expert, but anyone can look amazing!

                    When it comes to fashion, a great deal of inspiration comes from celebrities. Using the Awesome Face app, we can find out which celebrity we resemble the most. The similarity in facial structure and skin tone can help us with many fashion choices including a new haircut, hair colour, or a particular shape of glasses.
