                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's really hard to find people in a crowd, and it's really hard to keep giving directions to people who can't find you. We created a fun and simple way to locate your friends without having to zoom in on a map location or relying on pictures of your meeting point.

                    uses your phone's camera and augmented reality to pinpoint your friends' locations.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    wya is built for android. It uses the phone's camera view and phone GPS location to calculate the relevant AR feature positions to overlay on the screen.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was incompatibility with existing AR libraries. We overcame this challenge by writing our own AR framework from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge was the inaccuracy of the GPS sensors. We used low pass filtering to mitigate the effect.

                <p>
                    We're really proud of our simple UI and the implementation of our own AR framework!
