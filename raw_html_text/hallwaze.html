                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TJ is getting more and more confusing to maneuver, and with prom asking's occurring all over the school, we figured it was time to create an app that can not only provide traffic patterns of the school but report major events all in the palm of your hand
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a mix of buttons, databases, and colorful graphs, HallWaze brings together an easily usable app that only requires clicking buttons
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being all first time android developer users, our biggest challenge was just figuring out how to code...anything!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android developer is really difficult to learn, but also very helpful. We all started from scratch but we learned very many skills necessary to use android development
                </p>
