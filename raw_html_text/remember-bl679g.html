Already the internet and cell phones have moved us into a state wherein digitally-assisted memory is the norm. With

                    is written in node.js and go. The Alexa skill is written in node.js. And, running off a raspberry pi with webcams connected to it is a go script that causes the device to act as a local server for processing the surfaces visible to the webcams. Alexa sends a signal to the pi to take pictures of the surrounding area. This triggers the go script that takes the pictures, saves them if items have moved significantly, splices them into smaller pictures to increase fidelity, sends them to clarifai for item recognition, processes the returned JSON and stores the processed results in Firebase. The Alexa skill then gets the results from firebase and tells you where the item you're looking for is located, provided that it was within
