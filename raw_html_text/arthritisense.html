                    Arthritisense is a novel doctor-patient interface system that tracks the entire therapy process, from reminding patients to do their exercises through monitoring correct positioning and providing feedback to the doctor. The database communicates with a python program that dictates what exercise the patient needs to perform and uses the Leap Motion VR Device to detect if the patient is performing the specific exercises correctly. Our project aims to increase communication between patients and doctors and to make arthritis exercises more accessible as well as fun for the 40 million people in the US that suffer from arthritis. We hope to continue development to bring a product to the market.
