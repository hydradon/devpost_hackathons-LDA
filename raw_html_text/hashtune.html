                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A desire to achieve something really cool and creative, regardless of how useless it is.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the user types in words or phrases and presses a button, the program plays music that's built based on the metadata of the string.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to use Java almost exclusively but something that helped me a lot was SoundHelix, an open-source tool for random music generation that I tweaked and played around with heavily until I was able to achieve my desired results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team actually ended up changing our ideas a couple of times because we were overall very inexperienced and we didn't want to end up not being able to finish anything. On that journey, we had to get assaulted by MySQL, PHP, and Android, but we made it somehow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm really proud of the tweaks I've been able to make and the ways in which I was able to use the extremely limited resources that SoundHelix provided, because if I do say so myself, the music sounds really nice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I should never, ever overestimate myself; confidence is a good thing, but being able to take potential hazards into account is even more important when it comes to the deep, dark seas of computer programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HashTune
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since what we had originally planned was an Android app and that didn't turn out too well, I suppose the natural next step would be to take another crack at it to develop it as a mobile application.
