                <p>
                    Pokemon! Gotta Learn 'em all! It's you and me I know it's our destiny...
                </p>
                <p>
                    So many Pokemon, so little time to learn them all. Pokedex-AR makes it easy to identify Pokemon and track their stats and characteristics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pokedex-AR is a ARCore solution that allows users to identify pokemon from a picture at a touch of their screens. Our creation yields a 3D model of pokemon, loading information such as their type, abilities, capture rate, base stats, etc. In addition, we integrated 3D models of trainers, building, miscellaneous objects, and even sounds into our app, submerging users into the Pokemon experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using Unity, ARCore, and Firebase. We scraped information on over 800 pokemon across 7 generations from serebii.net. We were able to scrape the 3D models of about 500 pokemon from models-resource.com along with sounds and textures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scraping everything took longer than we had hoped, leaving little time to do the rest of the work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We reduced our the overall size of our assets (3d models, textures, sounds, etc) from ~2.7GB down to ~340MB using Unity AssetBundles stored in Firebase Storage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    More polished look. Add more 3d models of pokemon
