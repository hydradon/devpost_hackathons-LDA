                    We developed an website which helps organize and plan volunteer services throughout a local area.
A couple of key technologies we used for this project are Twillio and Google Maps API. These services
work in parallel to find the most nearby registered volunteers and send them a text message, in which
they can accept or deny a request for service. The radius of search is expanded until the required
number of volunteers is reached. It was inspired by the JPMorgan hacking for social good challenge.
