                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Information is readily accesible today, even when we don't want it to be. Many times, we are unaware of the digital footprint we are leaving behind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PaperTrail allows you to keep track of your digital footprint by analyzing the data you put out on the worldwide web. It promotes leaving a positive digital footprint, and allows you to keep track of active and passive digital footprints. A karma system keeps you motivated to continue making a positive impact on the internet.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PaperTrail uses a chrome extension to identify instances of your credentials on a page, and keeps track of found information on a MongoDB database. By analyzing the footprints in the database, PaperTrail assigns you a point value for your &lsquo;karma&rsquo; on the web, using Capital One, awarding you for positive digital contributions such as content about charity, productivity, and positivity, while taking points away for negative footprints. This promotes you to positively shape your internet image. In addition, you can request your karma, and information about your footprint by texting from your phone, using the Twilio API.
