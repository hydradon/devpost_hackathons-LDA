                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make coworking spaces more intimate, dynamic, and flexible. A big inspiration for the 'shapeshifting' ability that saves space are tiny houses (e.g. in Hong Kong) that make use of fold-away furniture and walls to make the most of their small spaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution is a adaptable meeting room space with mobile walls and a smart key access system which will be able to form meeting rooms when the user checks-in as well as return back to an open area for people to use when not booked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had experience of how meeting rooms can sometimes be untilised at times and yet high in demand at other times. Hence, we decided to have a solution to have more meeting room space but not at the expense of the fixed installations of a office space. We used interior design.

                <h1>
                    Challenges we faced
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We had to think very hard of the actual layout of the walls and how we could execute it using existing software, as well as what materials to use - which none of us had professional experience with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to look at a space and think of practical, physical ideas that can shape it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Adapted
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd love to think about more creative ways that our walls can be used, and how to host all sorts of events just by changing around the space and furniture.
