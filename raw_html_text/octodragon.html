                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a bunch of sensors and buttons lying around our desks from previous projects, so we made a tool to use them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Octodragon connects a bunch of sensors to the Dragonboard 410c and processes the inputs to produce easy-to-use update events like "button pressed" and "light level changed to 622". It then sends the events over the internet to a computer where they are processed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by connecting sensors to the dragonboard and filtering the signals. We then built a web server to listen for events and transmit events from the board to the computer. We then write a UI for users to easily choose what actions each event triggers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent the majority of our time setting up the Dragonboard and connecting it to the wifi. It took a while to figure out that the breakout board had a separate processor that had to be programmed separately from the Dragonboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was also difficult to figure out which ports to use for each sensor. For example, the touch sensor required a port with 5V and didn't work in the 3.3V port.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had to filter each sensor differently. For the ring buffer, we used a the running average of the light sensor to make a low pass filter. We made state machines to decode and debounce the encoder and detect button presses. We also used a timer to limit the number of updates from the potentiometer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote code separately and it worked when we connected everything together. We also utilized many different disciplines like hardware, IOT, and user interfaces.
                </p>
