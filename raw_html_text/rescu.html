                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to give back to the small communities of animals shelters. We were also inspired by our collective love for animals.

                <p>
                    It is a website that you can search for animals to adopt at your local animal shelters, find events in your local community to raise money for the shelters to support and take care of the animals, pair yourself up to an animal that matches your lifestyle and be able to make your own profile.
