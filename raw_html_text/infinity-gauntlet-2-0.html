                <p>
                    We were originally inspired by the "glove-game" combination through Nintendo's development of the Power Glove  and the RTS Glove, a button and gesture controller worn in the web-series

                    also inspired us. One of our team members has a brother with a crippled hand, and our project aims to help people with motor impairment to enjoy video games and electronic use.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the glove, you can play our custom game "Gauntlet Guitar," a clone of Guitar Hero. Each finger has a button that corresponds to the different keys in the game. Within the game, there are three different levels of difficulty. Each level has its own song and a uniquely designed game structure that pairs with the beats in the song.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Arduino Uno Starter Kit, a soldering iron, the Arduino Leonardo, tactile push buttons, and 32 gauge wire to build the controller. The keyboard emulation software was built with the Arduino IDE and our game's software was built with Processing 3.5.3.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially ran into an issue of how we should all work on our project at the same time. To fix this, we used a GitHub repository to actively sync and work with the newest versions of our Processing classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Processing is most useful when it comes to 2D graphics which became difficult when extrapolating data from a 3D-based game, so we made some compromises and found mathematical solutions to resolve our problems. For example, we utilized geometry to model the guitar strings and buttons to provide a 3D-like experience. The guitar strings and base are scalable due to the formulaic graphing of the lines that takes the size of the window as inputs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also ran into the issue of matching the guitar keys and times to the animation onscreen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the resources that we had, the design quality of the glove does not prove 100% efficiency when it comes to reactive responses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program the Arduino Leonardo to emulate keystrokes, the Processing language for creating interactive games, Adobe Photoshop for the editing and creation of graphics, and Git / GitHub-hosted repositories for team collaboration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Infinity Gauntlet 2.0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our future plans include the use of motion tracking for VR implementation, and additional controls so that we can isolate controllers to a single hand. In addition, with funding and access to better equipment, we can create more sensitive controllers compared to the buttons on our current prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also want to expand compatibility with assistive devices and controllers to provide enjoyment to those with motor or tactile impairments and reduction of carpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive strain injuries.
