                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I rarely remember what I have in my fridge, which is inconvenient when I am trying to make a quick meal before class. I used my time this weekend to try and fix that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you take a picture of your food on Frdg, a computer vision algorithm detects all the food and adds it to your virtual fridge. Based on the food currently in your fridge, Frdg will recommend the healthiest food you can make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Frdg is an iOS app built on React Native, a Computer Vision API and an ingredient-to-recipe API. It uses Firebase to maintain the list of ingredients in the fridge.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a new React Native user, I ran into a few issues while trying to understand the ins and outs of React.
