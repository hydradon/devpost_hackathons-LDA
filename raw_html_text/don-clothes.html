                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Canada, the average person throws away 81 pounds of textiles annually.  North Americans, in total, send 9.5 million tonnes of clothing to the landfill each year - 95% of these clothes can be reused or recycled.  After hearing these alarming statistics we were motivated to create a solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don Clothes creates a platform to allow thrift stores to incentivize users to donate their clothing, rather than throw it away.  By tracking the clothing that is donated by users, thrift stores provide incentives in the form of points the user can earn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is a web app delivered through Node.js, express, handlebars, and uses technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3 to display our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too many ideas, not enough focus.  In the brainstorming phase we weren't able to decide on a topic early enough.  This cost us a lot of time and energy early on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons are fun (and stressful)!  It's tough being given only a limited amount of time to work on a project with new friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Don Clothes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don Clothes needs to be developed for the mobile platform to reach more people.  Currently our app is only available as a website but in the future we hope to have an iOS and Android app.
