                <p>
                    Therapy Dogs are household dogs that can be used as a therapy with minimal training. The goal is to improve a participant's  emotional, or cognitive functioning and can be useful for educational and motivational effectiveness for participant. The training requirements for Therapy Dogs are easier than service/assistant dogs. So any dog with minimal training can be a Therapy Dog.  The goal of this project is to build a network between patients/caretakers  and caring individuals who are willing to share their "friendly pets" to bring happiness and uplift the emotional health.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The product is an app that will facilitate the above goal. The product will help create a database of available therapy dogs and a database of interested trainers/testers. Any person with a dog can register his/her dog as a Therapy Dog. We will search and build a network of dog trainers. Moreover, any interested trainer can register him/her as a certified trainer. The goal is to connect a Therapy Dog with a dog trainer.   Any interested user of this app can search for Therapy Dogs nearby and can schedule a meetup with the pet.
