                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've always enjoyed playing games that encourage you to use your imagination so I figured I could take a shot at making my own. While text-based adventure games may look simple, their unexpected depth and the way that they can immerse the play has always been interesting to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's fairly simple in operation as it's just a single python file that runs the adventure. It lets the player explore 6 rooms and interact with a variety of objects and scenarios in them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this primarily using python as it excels for simpler programs such as this. The code starts with declaring many of the arrays and dictionaries that I use to store things such as room descriptions, relationships, and items. The majority of the game runs in a while loops that continuously executes till the player wins. Within the while loops are quite a few if statements that handle all of the player interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My upper-level Python isn't the most polished so I had to spend time working on the logic of running the program and how to handle things like room and item relationships.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've had a few people play test it and they have all said it's enjoyable which is always nice to hear after putting effort into a game.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One big thing that I feel more comfortable with after this project is using dictionaries and arrays together and nesting them to create the desired effect. It made me think in ways that I hadn't had to before.
                </p>

                    What's next for The Great Escape
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working on this project has given me the idea of creating a framework for text based adventure games that can be used to easily create games by those who are not comfortable programming. By standardizing the creation process I think it wouldn't be too hard to create a program with a GUI so that the user can create the game that they envision.
