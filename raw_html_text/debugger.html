                    Debugger lets students eliminate an army of bugs threatening UCSC's Science and Engineering Library. These bugs pop out from behind trees, fences, and other objects then disappear. The player must use the mouse that is in the shape of a crosshair to shoot down the bugs. When shot, these bugs are not just insects, but also common programming bugs. This game is meant to act as a stress-reliever for students when they struggle with programming assignments and computer science as a whole.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using CSS, HTML, Javascript, tears, sweat and love
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're beginners! 
Coding in Javascript when we are most proficient with Java
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At least our code compiles and kills bugs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that taking crash courses on Codecademy and then trying to code in those languages in a 11 hour time block is really painful, especially for beginners like us. Also, we learned more about Git and HTML and that programming is basically getting information and utilizing it (i.e Google and Stack Overflow).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Debugger
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can actually finish the project, have a working counter, randomizing the bugs' positions, and have an intro screen before the game.
