                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stacy makes really bomb cupcakes! There are many times that she is asked to make cupcakes for events and has no idea what flavors to make. We wanted to develop an app that would help her with these decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cupcake Roulette is an app that allows the user to decide on cupcakes. The user has the option to get a random pairing or to give a preference on either the cake flavor or icing and will receive a match that has been proven to taste amazing!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user interface was written on codepen using html, css, and jquery. The backend was developed separately using Flask and Peewee. The back end is set up as a database of tested cupcake flavor pairings. The two pieces were then connected using Json to create a responsive website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Front End
                    </strong>
                    - it was difficult to create the layers for the oven and to get the animations correct. This was especially true of the oven doors and the cupcake animation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Back-End
                    </strong>
                    - learning Flask posed some difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Responsive animation, learning to create the back-end, and connecting the two.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first larger project that Stacy had done with jquery. And Sami did an amazing job at learning the back end design.
                </p>

                    What's next for Cupcake Roulette
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we would like to add recipes and shopping lists for the chosen pairing.
