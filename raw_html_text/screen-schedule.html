                <h2>
                    Inspiration: We wanted an app that we could use to help us manage our schoolwork and time wisely.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Sets a timer to help you finish your work and plan out daily tasks in an organized and easy way.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: We used different functions and events that we linked up together to perform certain actions that are key features of our app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: In the middle, we wanted to add more to our app to make it more useful , but it took time to come up with an idea and execute it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: Being able to code and create a thoughtful presentation in one sitting and being able to create an app that is useful for students.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: How to link certain buttons to other actions and events to carry out functions.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for screen schedule: We want to improve on our app by blocking certain apps when the timer starts and send reminders to the users when they are not using the app.
