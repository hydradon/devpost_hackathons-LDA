                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a group of friends who enjoy playing the game League of Legends and so decided to try and create something using their API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At current, there are two separate systems. One where you enter an item name from the game and the form returns the description of its stats as well as an image for that item. The other system is one where you give a player name and the region, then if that player is currently in a live game - the form will return who is in the game with that player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a website called jsfiddle.net to allow us to try out using javascript in conjunction with html. We used
                    <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods" rel="nofollow">
                        https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods
                    </a>
                    for reference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't plan effectively - which is how we ended up with two separate systems. For each of us, this is our first hackathon so we are all learning from each other and trying to understand what we should expect from ourselves within this time. Also, none of us had used html and javascript before so that was another learning curve - although prior programming experience between us made breaking this barrier down easier than the others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A working lookup of an item's statistics with a background image on the form. The live games form also returns other players currently in the game too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use html and javascript! Also understanding about JSON files and how to pull information from them.
                </p>

                    What's next for Use of LoLInfo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unifying the two systems and making the design of the form a bit more sophisticated.
