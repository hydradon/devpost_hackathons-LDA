                    The  Voice Capsule concept has been in the making for over 20 years. &nbsp;Have you ever wanted to talk to someone and you know  they are not available? &nbsp;The original concept was to have family  and friends record their life stories. &nbsp;But, we needed to find an easy way  to share those stories today and with future generations. &nbsp;With the Amazon  Echo devices Alexa provides an avenue for those stories to be shared.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                    But  as we began programming, we realized Voice Capsule can provide so much more.  &nbsp;Every user can transform Voice Capsule  into what would be most beneficial to them and whomever they share their  recordings with.
