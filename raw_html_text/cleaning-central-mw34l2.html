                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always stained my clothes and never knew how to clean it. I always had to text my parents how to clean them. Now, with our web app, there is a convenient location that holds all of the information about doing laundry and cleaning stains.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app efficiently displays every stain and every clothing type and each way to launder them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a bootstrap template called "Freelance" to easily design our website. Afterwards, we gathered all the information related laundry and stains. Afterwards we attempted to code a log-in system that would track each piece of clothing using javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firebase was difficult to learn and use in the span of one day. Thus, making the database hold all of the timing data for each user was not feasible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our website design.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that database coding is difficult. It is very difficult to edit a template's code. We learned how to present in an effective manner.
