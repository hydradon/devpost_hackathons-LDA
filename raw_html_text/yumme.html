                    When people go out for food, they are seemingly complacent with the location prior to arrival, but after getting their food they become disappointed. This website solves that problem by showing users the food before going so that they can decide what they want to eat.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This helps users determine what kind of food they want to eat based on their past choices and current comparison of images from various restaurants. They are shown two pictures at a time, taken from Yelp, and they choose one that they would rather eat. After enough comparisons for the algorithm to figure out what they would want to eat, they are shown a location and its relevant information.
