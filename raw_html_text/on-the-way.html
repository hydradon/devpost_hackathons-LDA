                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we have used postmates before for Chipotle delivery, it is very expensive and slow. We realized that we didn't need full time deliverers and could instead leverage people already going to get food for themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects people who want to order food to those who are picking it up. For example, I live in Rodin college house on campus, and when I walk to Wawa I know there are 20+ others in Rodin who want Wawa as well. The idea is that they log on to the app and request their food items and how much they are willing to pay for them. Since I am headed back to Rodin anyway, I gladly pick up anothe meal in order to make a small sum.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used meteor.js for the back end and most of the front end. We used meteor in order to access MongoDB, where we stored food deliveries, orders, account user names, etc. We also used some simple css/html editing to make it look slightly nicer than black text on a white background. Using meteor will allow us to port it to an iPhone and Android without any effort. We are hosting the MongoDB remotely on BlueMix, and hosting the rest of the sight (due to technical issues with BlueMix and Meteor.js) on Linode. We are tracking an account balance based on data and transactions from the Capital One API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While meteor.js was easy to develop on as it combined front and back-end, it was difficult to incorporate with many APIs. Fortunately, there were some great mentors with some experience with Meteor willing to help us out.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating our first ever web application, especially since none of us had written any javascript before this weekend. We are also proud simply for having participated, as we usually watch the Penn Apps hacking as casual observers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to host a website, how to use APIs with Javascript (specifically meteor), database management, designing web page UI in CSS, how to host a domain and site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for On the Way
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we can add more locations and food items and incorporate real transaction data (as opposed to Capital One's dummy data) we believe this application will allow many people on our campus to get affordable delivery and make money doing the things they already do every day.
