                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used prompt five and were inspired by the forms of stewardess carts in combination with the interesting forms of cleaning droids in Star Wars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our device is pushed down an isle by the stewardess or cleaning crew in between flights. The scanner eye at the bottom picks up when the cart passes a seat and tells the sprayer nozzle to spray an antimicrobial solution onto the seats, effectively killing the germs on the seats and armrests within the cabin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After going through several phases of design sketching, coming up with a form we were happy with, we created a 3D model in Solidworks. Afterwards, we dropped the file into Keyshot to create nice looking renderings of the product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our presentation turned out better than we had expected it to. Additionally, our renderings turned out looking fairly nice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a good deal about germ control and management within planes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pure Flight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would construct 3D prototypes. We would then proceed to testing the prototypes with a sample group. Finally, we would produce functioning models.
