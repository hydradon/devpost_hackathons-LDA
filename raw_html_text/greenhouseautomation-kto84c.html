                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to build a flexible system that I can add to or take components away from to work with them individually, so to that end I have my code broken up into (at least for me) easily readable and well commented chunks, and as far as my input/output goes, I am currently using an LCD screen and 3 LEDs to indicate status, along with buttons to simulate various conditions (time to water, manual watering activated, lack of humidity, etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently still having an issue with my humidity monitor/thermometer where it occasionally returns something that is not a number "NaN" when it gets printed to screen. Looking into documentation, it appears to be an issue with this model, and I am just now trying to create a workaround. Besides that, I was having strange issues with my breadboard and code, but due to the guys at Hardware I was able to get it up and running, specifically Brandon and Jacob. Thanks for being patient, guys :)

                    Getting it to work
Having 95% of the features done that I know are achievable in this timeframe
Learning something new that I enjoy

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started not having touched an Arduino, and by this time I have learned how to write a program in a whole new language while also learning how to set up the hardware - I love it :)
The value of patience and persistence
