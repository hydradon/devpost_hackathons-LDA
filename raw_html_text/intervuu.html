                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students in tech, we find that one of the most difficult parts of attaining a job is the technical interview. They&rsquo;re stressful, long and hard, and the only way to improve is through practice. However, it&rsquo;s very hard to find someone willing to spend an hour or two of their undivided attention and then give you their honest opinion (due to personal bias and their relationship to you). So we came up with a solution, an accurate robot that can interview you (whenever you&rsquo;re free), and analyzes the interview in real time, providing you with a score on how well you did, in terms of voice, body language and question responses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Intervuu.me analyzes the interview in real time, providing you with data about how you&rsquo;re speaking in terms of your pitch, tone, nervousness and monitors your body language, are you swinging your arms about? Are you looking at the interviewer or looking down all the time? Our backend will then give you a score at the end of the interview with options on how to improve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google's Cloud Platform for most of the backend, we implemented Speech to text to transcribe what the user was saying, then the Natural Language API to understand the context of the interview, and rate the answers. The data is then processed using Google's Compute Engine then passed back to the Text to Speech API to output through the speakers.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Our major challange was that we were working with so many different loose components, like the leap motion, fitbit, all the Google API's and all the other idea's we had proved very difficult to implement together, as we constantly ran into bugs. Unfortuantely, any time we would ask the mentors for help they would be just as lost as us. " -
