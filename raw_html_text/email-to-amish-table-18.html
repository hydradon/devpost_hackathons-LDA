                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by an appreciation for SparkPost and an interest in email functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Email-to-Amish allows you to email the text of a letter to a server which would print and mail the letter to the address and recipient of your choice. You can also enter the letter and recipient into a web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using node.js, Javascript, Html, CSS Bootstrap, and a small amount of jQuery in conjunction with SparkPost's fuse-email and lob.com's lob-node.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a challenge formatting the letter correctly and communicating the web app with the server back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how far we came with the node/javascript side of it since we started with very minimal knowledge of how to use them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to connect different packages and use them to work together and accomplish a wider task than they're meant for.
