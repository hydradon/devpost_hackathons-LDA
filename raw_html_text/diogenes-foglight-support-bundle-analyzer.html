                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Foglight support bundles contain a gold mine of information for diagnosing how Foglight has been running in a customers environment. Parsing through the logged information can be time consuming and prone to missing critical information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I developed the program to simplify support bundle analysis and to reduce analysis time required to determine if Foglight is running well.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scans through Support bundle log files looking for key information such as "server overload" and summarizing the number of Fatal, Errors, and Warning conditions detected. In some cases depending on an Error detected, Diogenes will recommend KB articles to read to resolve a problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scans through a Foglight diagnostics log file and reports on information that is discovered which is valuable to a support analysis.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developed the java program in eclipse
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Support bundle log files can be very large to process. Diagnostics log files don't have data in a fixed location. Data for a host may sometimes be located at the top of a diagnostics file and other times at the beginning of a file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a diagnostics log file, many components such as hosts as referred to by their object ID. Diogenes will pick up host Object IDs when a host section is read and then display full host names for host information instead of object IDs.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about the different processes supported by a Foglight server
                </p>

                    What's next for diogenes - Foglight Support Bundle Analyzer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will be adding support for new releases of Foglight as the Foglight developers continue to write out new strings to Foglight log files as Foglight is expanded.
