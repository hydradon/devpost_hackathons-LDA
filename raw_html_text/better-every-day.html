                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people think that decreasing their impact on the environment takes a lot of work. I thought that through Alexa, getting a small tip a day and learning about the impact it makes can push people to be more conscious about their decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each day, Alexa provides the user with a new tip such as "unplug the electronics you do not use" to the user. The user can learn more about how doing this would impact the world, as well as themselves personally. This will provide multiple reasons to the user as to why they should follow the tip. If the user likes the tip, they can request Alexa to remember it. The next time they ask for a tip, Alexa will say the new tip of the day, and also remind them of all the previously saved tips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend is built in Python Flask using flask-ask library which is called by Alexa.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the flask-ask library was difficult at first in getting it all setup and running. Also, it was difficult getting Alexa to remember all of the previous tips so that it can recall them in new sessions.
