                    The Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Tania Finlayson who was born with Cerebral Palsy, as a result of a complicated birth. She strived to communicate with the outside world by designing hardware that allowed her to speak through Morse code. So we decided to make a free app that would allow virtually anyone with a smartphone to receive crucial alerts through morse code.

                <h2>
                    Its Purpose
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This revolutionary app allow the disabled to receive critical alerts at the convenience of your pocket. You automatically receive updates from around the globe or nearby events depending on your preferences through vibrations all while having your phone in your pocket.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to make the app that receives push notifications when major alerts occur. We also extended our app to voice controlled devices such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home so one could request information on the fly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Faced
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had learn new programming languages and we had to get familiar with Morse Code and its many variations. We also learned that morse code was not limited to a certain disability or language. Of the many disabilities, this app caters to the hard of hearing, visually impaired and the mute. There were also many languages that use morse code, but for the time constraints, we focused on the international version of the latin character set.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that were were able to make a fully functional app that was deployed on the Android platform through the Google Play Store to all 143 countries across the Globe. We also published an Alexa skill that allows the user to interact with the App on a personal note.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work together as a group by giving ourselves tasks and set aside stretch goals for further improvements for the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main goal was to allow text to be translated through sensory feedback which was successful. We started to work on a morse to text keyboard for Android that would allow a person to type without having to look at their phone directly just by knocking morse code sequences on their device.
