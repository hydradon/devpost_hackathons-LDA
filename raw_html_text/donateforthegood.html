                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is always a pain to throw things that are not useful anymore yet still new at the end of each semester. Donating to a charity would be a great option, but sometimes it just seems too troublesome. So we would like to build a website to help find the nearest charity that needs the donation the most.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps people to find the most suitable charity. By clicking on the type of donations they are going to make, such as "books", people can be directed to a Google map with all charities that need book shown. Then people can simply find the nearest charity. There are also special events listed and people can find those events to attend if interested.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html, css and Bootstrap for the web design, and we use the Google Map API to help visualize the charities. We also link a database to our website.
