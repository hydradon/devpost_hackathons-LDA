                    A member of our group is a Doctor who introduced us to the idea of an app to help with ongoing conditions such as cystic fibrosis. The specifics of the project were then discussed as a group.

                <p>
                    It attempts to make the daily life of a child going through treatment for cystic fibrosis easier. It would accomplish this by helping with the tracking of exercise and medication, providing games themed around and involving the medication (to make taking several pills a day more interesting), and by offering a section for potential support and funding ideas for families that need it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app was build inside Android-Studio
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having never used Android Studio before there were several quirks to the software/android that I did not find familiar and needed to get my head around, such as the separate layouts or the use of xml files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am most proud that by the end of the 24 hour period, whether complete or not, despite never having done any app development before, I have an app on my phone that works (excluding bugs).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I gained a lot of knowledge of app development and some of the insides of the android operating system.
