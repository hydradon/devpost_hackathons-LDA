                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main idea was to solve a problem of educational business - automatization of an end to end process from finding new students to their graduation from school or courses. The working experience of Julia made it possible to research the problem from different perspectives and find out a solution.

                <p>
                    Our prototype is an example of a web plus mobile application for SMM school with three courses: SMM, Instagram and Photoshop. User (student of our school) can navigate through courses, find necessary information, make actions with courses, which would trigger automatic actions (email to the marketing department or to the student, etc.), and track his progress.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built web application via HTML/CSS/JS and REST API and we also connect IOs application. The backend was made using Kotlin + Javalin. The mobile application was made with Swift. We started in an Agile manner - writing down user story and implementing functionality step by step. We also made several integrations to use ready to use solutions for our needs.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part was to work in a non-working environment, making the project for ourselves and without a budget, trying to keep a friendly yet productive atmosphere in our team.
