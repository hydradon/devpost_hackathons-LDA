                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CryptoBot changes the way cryptocurrency is traded by changing the platform on which it is traded. Through the integration of the Capital One API and Facebook messenger, users have a larger access to the cryptocurrency market. We came upon the idea of CryptoBot when one of our teammates wanted an easier way to get his feet wet in cryptocurrency trading without having to change the platform he was already using. We settled on creating a Facebook Messenger chat bot because all of us use Facebook Messenger.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a Facebook messenger chat bot that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies in real time. First, the users create a Capital One account and link it to a GDAX cryptocurrency trading account. Then, our bot automatically trades the specified cryptocurrency using technical indicators and machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Capital One Nessie API to create a unique savings account for each user. Then, we used machine learning to train a model to predict the price of the specified cryptocurrency. This is the backbone of the trading bot, which uses the GDAX platform to trade cryptocurrencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble integrating the GDAX API to work with Amazon AWS. Also, the machine learning model required continuous tweaks and updates, but we finally built a model which accurately predicts future cryptocurrency prices. Finally, we ran into some trouble calling the Amazon AWS lambda function continuously in order to trade cryptocurrencies without stopping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to integrate APIs together and with Amazon AWS. Having never created a Facebook messenger chat bot, we learned a lot about API.ai and how easy it is to create a chat bot on Facebook messenger.
