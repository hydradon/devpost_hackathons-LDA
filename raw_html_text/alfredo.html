                <p>
                    Alfredo is a tool to keep track of the inventory in one's fridge. Unlike many existing smart fridge that scans your receipts in order to register the recent items added to the fridge, it uses the speech recognition feature of a smart home assistant, e.g. Amazon Echo add and remove items. Additionally, it keeps tracks of the amount of time a certain product has been stored in the fridge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The inventory is accessible even when you are not at home making your trip at the groceries easier. Additionally, Alfredo's inventory can keep a record of your eating or food waste habits.

                    None of us knows about databases, but we are working on that. We also had very little experience in web development.

                    Being able to stitch our parts together.

                    That AWS is less straightforward than we thought

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to have a built-in camera that would keep track of the item entering and exiting the fridge. Using large database to get a good estimate of expiring date of products and have the home assistant give meal suggestion using the available food in the fridge.
