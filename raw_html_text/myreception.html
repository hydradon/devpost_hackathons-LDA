                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Main goal is to track progress not only by asking frequent questions like "have you already taken that medicine", but actually taking care about the customer's health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For each disease treatment is constructed on the server using the web form. Client's mobile application receives notifications from server to ask patient about his or her current state. Questions may be like:
Are you still sneezing?
What's your body temperature?
Received answer is send back to the server, and it calculates score. 
If score is decreasing, than treatment is going fine. Patient will be continually notified to take correct medicine in the right time and asked state questions. When score reaches zero and illness time runs out, patient is asked to visit doctor. Doctor also receives notification.
But if the score is continuously increasing, patient is asked to call a doctor and doctor is notified.
                </p>

                    What's next for myRECEPTION
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step is creating flexible modelling instrument to track the progress for each and every possible disease, and notify doctors about it's progression without the need to personally see the patient.
