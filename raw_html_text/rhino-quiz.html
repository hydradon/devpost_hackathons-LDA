                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sumatran Rhinos, once with a population size of ~1,000 in the 1980s, are now estimated to have only 80 individuals remaining in the wild due to increasing human pressures. A successful captive breeding program led by the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary remains one of the last hopes to mitigate against the expected extinction of this species. We are inspired to utilize growth hacking and other online fundraising best practices to support this cause before it's too late.

                <p>
                    Rhino Quizzes aim to acquire, engage and recruit new online donors to support the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary's captive breeding program.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used several languages and resources to develop the quiz. We also learned about Sumatran Rhinos to identify potential questions that can be used in quizzes most likely to excite new users.
