                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Montreal, Toronto, or wherever - there's always something happening but how can you find out about it?
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EventGo is like the Yelp of real time events. It connects users with events in their city providing metrics to see how popular the events are in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built EventGo using the SEAN stack (MEAN - Mongo + MySQL). To create out map interface we used the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a system to monitor the population of events has proven difficult. However we believe that we have developed a reliable process using regular POST requests to monitor location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of noobies with varied skill sets we managed to create an idea and follow it through, learning a lot along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CSS is not your friend. Also, make sure you close your tabs when you're testing ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EventGo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add a portal for promoters to add events. Include Facebook integration to allow users to have personal events listed. Incorporate other cities.
