                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I took Arabic course back in uni and then taught the reading skill to some of my friends. I've realised that having a tool for independent practice is would be nice.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are 8 lessons, each having from 3 to 4 characters. So you complete them by playing a game.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On swift. My friend, who's a qualified teacher of Arabic provided me with all the sound recordings i needed for it.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gamifying an educational app to keep it both productive and engaging is the main challenge. Constantly trying to make it better.
