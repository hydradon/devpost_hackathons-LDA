                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members had gone through the legal system and had noticed that finding resources, information, and legal documents were easily accessible. She mentioned that she wished that there was an application which could help educate those not familiar with the legal system and provide support in a difficult time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website provides education on legal terms, court proceedings, and where to find additional resources. In addition, it maintains a library of legal documents as well as the ability to organize and save personal documents discreetly.
How we built it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split into teams of front-end and back-end, using Github to consolidate our work. The hidden document viewer makes use of Google Drive's Application Data folder to ensure that files can remain hidden from those who may have gotten access to a client's Google Drive to protect privacy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting to Google Drive API was difficult, but a good learning experience. For a team of mostly beginners, learning the language and managing the repository was challenging, though educational.
Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </p>

                <p>
                    We're proud of creating something that can illustrate a vision, especially given the limited collective coding experience and relative size of the group.
What we learned

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    We learned how to create a website, use an API and how to ask for assistance
                </p>

                    What's next for LawForMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're hoping to make the site live, and add more features like making forms available by state, having an escape feature, a live chat, and an actually working hidden document drive.
