                    This weekend we were introduced to a next level in Ethereum Technology, and exposed to doing things we&rsquo;ve never done before on-chain.
We thought hard about the benefits of creating location proofs, simplified onboarding, private transactions, utilizing scalable side-chains, and even incorporating machine learning - and we wanted to do it all!
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we ended up with was a novel idea for a real life problem, that we care deeply about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Censorship has always been around, but today, there&rsquo;s a new twist, misinformation campaigns with online trolls discrediting real events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a system, utilizing the technology we learned about today, that meets this need head on, and provides people with the tools to provably participate-in and share real events that are at risk of media censorship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we built Anon:Hero
A platform to help anyone tell their story, and unequivically prove it on the blockchain, while protecting their identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using Torus for secure sign-in, Enigma to create annonymous transactions, and skale EVM, storage, and attempting ML, for lightining fast processing, storage and computation - we were able to come close to meeting this lofty goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we chose to focus on an edge case today, the technology we&rsquo;ve harnessed has the potential to impact industry, social services, and entertainment when applied in combination with the right mix of network participants and third party data providers.
