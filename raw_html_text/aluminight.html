                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons are an amazing opportunity for learning, and our team of four decided to impulsively delve into C++ for the first time while experimenting with Ubisoft's API. We took the Ubisoft challenge's theme prompt and used it to inspire our very own interpretation of the mysterious unknown. These ideas are metaphorically represented by light and darkness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Luz, the player travels around an area, with their vision limited by the darkness. The goal is to search for stars, and use them to light lamps. Their goal is to find all the stars and to illuminate as much of the map as possible. But watch out! Hidden enemies("spooky ghosts") chase you around and if they catch you, you have to start over!
