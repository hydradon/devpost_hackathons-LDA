                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have experienced issues finding parking spot when going to campus after 8 am. We wanted to make a practical application that would make life easier for students and be environmentally friendly at FSU.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a website that lets you find other students you can share a ride with to go to campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used codepen.io to be able to work together and see recent changes on our HTML5, CSS, and Javascript documents. We created an SQL database over google cloud to store the drivers', riders', and ride information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we were unsure which software to use to implement our idea. In addition, we created a domain and when we tried to connect it to our website it didn't let us do it for free. But, our biggest challenge (still) was to be able to connect our google cloud SQL database to the HTML document.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud that we were able to design and put together a mock website in less than 24 hours. We were able to work succesfully as a group and come up with an idea even though we didn't know each other before the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a database in SQL using google cloud and how to get started in building a website. We also learned that we can't use PHP in codepen. In addition, we were able to refresh some concepts we have used in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for College Carpool
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to figure out how to connect our website with the database we created. After that, we need to learn more PHP in order to understand how back-end items work with each other. Maybe a mobile application later.
