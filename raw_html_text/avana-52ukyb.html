                    Long lines at the check-in, the security check, baggage check-in, ...
You get out of the train and need to go to the toilet very urgent. But where is the next one? And after you finally found one, where can you pick up your baggage.

                    There is no need anymore to be confused, because Avana will navigate you to your desired destinations. Just open the app and choose from all possibilities from your current airport where you want to go. You will be navigated safely and on the shortest way. 
And if you add the IATA of your flight, you will also get a notification, that it is time to get to your gate and of course it will show you the best way here as well.

                <p>
                    The project left a lot of possible development into several directions. I was difficult to decide what to implement first, since we would like to have implement all the features already.
