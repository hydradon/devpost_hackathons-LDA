                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Partially to address growing concerns over security and safety but mostly to challenge ourselves over 24 hours, we decided to build an AR app as a proof of concept for how physical security could be handled from a virtual space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile app uses Google ARCore cloud anchors and sceneforms on the Android platform to display virtual interfaces as an innovative security feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ARCore relies heavily on 2D/3D renderable objects and with only 24 hours and very little graphic design/OpenGL experience we had to heavily rely on Andy the android as well as aiming to develop the app primarily as a proof of concept. ARCore cloud anchors are also currently limited to just one anchor instance which forced us to pivot away from several interesting ideas into something implementable in the timeframe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With little to no AR or android experience we were able to effectively create an app that displays the potential of virtual security measures.
                </p>

                    What's next for LockAR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration with hardware, more creativity with cloud anchors
