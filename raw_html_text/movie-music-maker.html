                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like hearing music from Star Wars, superhero movies, and star trek.  We thought that it would be cool if we made a website where we could hear music that represents a character or a series.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website prompts the user to pick a fandom, and a character or series. Then music plays that represents the character and series.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to link out html pages together, but for some reason, we could not link them together. We tried several ways including using id elements, and href, but they did not work.
