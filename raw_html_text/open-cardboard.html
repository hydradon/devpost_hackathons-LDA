                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a VR experience that can be shipped to anyone, anywhere, allowing them to jump straight in to VR without having to invest in an expensive gaming computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It augments a 6DOF virtual environment around you. This is a VR environment where the user has complete freedom to move. We also worked on bringing hand controls into the mix by using marker tracking. We integrating IBM speech to text to add voice commands and to make these experiences more interactive. We build a Pictionary game to depict this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Cardboard SDK as well as ARkit/ARCore. We also used voice from IBM Watson.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building on mobile brought a lot of performance challenges. Since the hardware wasn't made for this specific use case, getting anything to work was really hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get 6DOF mobile VR working on both ARCore and ARKit despite of the very small team size. We made a really intuitive hand tracking solutions to complement our platform. All this in a matter of 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about iOS dev/ ARKit Dev. It was also our first time networking in Unity. We also tried IBM Watson for the first time. All this combined made sure we had a continuous learning experience!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Open Cardboard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The platform requires a lot of optimization and is far from its final render. We plan to implement all of our ideas and get feedback before we take it to the public.
