                    Re-imagining the White Cane for Visually Impaired Individuals through Technology
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Problem:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Target Audience: Visually impaired individuals
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A small portion of Individuals who are visually impaired use the white cane
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The cane affects the behaviors of others
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                if they offer to help, sympathy, etc.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Current devices/tools employed by the visually impaired include: guide dogs, friends/family, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Those visually impaired are unable to interact with screen based technology
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Solution:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A device/tool/service to assist visually impaired individuals
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A kinetic proximity sensor to detect how close an object is from a subject
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Utilizing a threshold to determine if the proximity is under a particular depth, if so, we alarm the user through a series of vibrations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Vibrations would be emitted through a smart watch or telephone.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Technical Difficulties
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        All team members are beginners at coding
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kinect is a relatively new device, so not much information is readily available
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Languages we used: JavaScript and C#
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No Athenahack mentors had experience with Kinect, only one Microsoft individual was fluent in Kinect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No Athenahack mentors had experience with programming Pebble Smartwatch Applications -- this led us to pivot towards notifying the user their proximity to an object through vibrations through mobile phones.

                </ul>

                        We hope to use the technology we've created to then condense the Kinect into a smaller device and turn it into a wearable.

                        The technology employed in inSight can be used in other aspects such as Security.
