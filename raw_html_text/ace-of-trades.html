                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to streamline the art distribution aspect of pinterest and the service selling aspect of craigslist to help publicize local creators and businesses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows for creators to make posts to sell their products or services, and allows buyers to follow creators and look at feeds to look at things they potentially want to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the backend using Flask, which serves up an API that the front end will use. The API makes CRUD operations to our mongoDB to maintain users and posts. The front end is written in react.js, and serves the webpages and feeds that our users will see. The whole thing is containerized using docker, and served on an Azure kubernetes cluster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was not very strong in javascript, so creating the front end was a bit of a struggle. We also learned how to use pymongo and learning non-relational database methodologies as we were implementing the database. Finally, there were some problems understanding Azure's resource groups and subscriptions, which blocked us from provisioning the machines that we needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the front end that we spun up, the database that we created, and the progress made in the infrastructure development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about javascript and react, how to use mongoDB and non-relational databases, and the ins and outs of Microsoft Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ace of Trades
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we'd add more and more functionality to our app like user creation, user authentication, native chat and payment methods, using geodata to influence feeds, and getting SSL certificates.
