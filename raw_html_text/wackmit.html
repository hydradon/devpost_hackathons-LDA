                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In day-to-day life, a person may encounter situations that make them uncomfortable or put them in danger. We wanted to build a device that resolves these conflicts before they even begin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a wearable device that makes use of a camera coupled with a servo motor. The camera makes use of facial sentiment analysis techniques in order to detect when a user has encountered an individual with aggressive characteristics. When this occurs, the servo motor slams down a pool noodle onto the person's head - quickly deterring any violence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Raspberry Pi with an attached camera module. We used the Google Cloud Vision API to detect the sentiment of faces captured by the camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hat is surprisingly well balanced and sturdy. The product is reliable and fun to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a Raspberry Pi and associated peripherals is more complex than it would first seem.
