                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine Learning. We wanted to incorporate machine learning in a learning environment to help people

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea, is that we can take pictures with a phone and then it recognizes objects and stuff within the image and creates flash cards. It would then quiz you and if it recognizes what you say, then you get it right. If you pronounce it wrong and speech recognition can't understand you, then you get it wrong.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python to create our REST api's. And Java to create the android application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not get our REST api's that ran speech recognition and tensorflow to run on our google cloud virtual machine and have the endpoint actually send back requests. This took up about 10 hours of my time so our project didn't end up coming together.
                </p>
