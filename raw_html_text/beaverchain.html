                    A very simple blockchain that can be used by OSU students to vote. The purpose of this project is to create a transparent and immutable voting platform for OSU students.  The platform can be altered to be used for any voting application as it pertains to OSU students.  As an example, the platform is setup to count Yes or No votes, but it can be changed for anything else such as multiple candidate votes.
