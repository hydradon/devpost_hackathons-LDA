                    Our web application gives player an overview of how the game progressed throughout the entire round. After the round has finished, the player has the ability to see the an arial recap of the match. The player can learn how all the players in that round moved, eliminated hostiles etc, so he/she could watch and learn from the tactics of the opponent and do better the next round.
