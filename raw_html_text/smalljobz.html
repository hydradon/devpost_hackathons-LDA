                    When my partner and I were in residence in first year university, we had no reasonable way to go out and buy furniture or groceries. For this hackathon, we wanted to create a solution to that problem.

                    Modern successful companies such as Uber, Facebook, Alibaba, and Airbnb operate in a different way than most companies. Rather than providing products and services directly to customers, they are what is known as interface companies, bridging the gap between suppliers and consumers. This gives freelance workers and small suppliers significant exposure to the market through the internet, as well as provides high-quality products and services to consumers. Connecting those who have something to offer with those who are looking for something is, in essence, what all of the companies I've mentioned base their entire businesses on. The best part of this is that its working. Uber is the world's largest taxi company. Facebook is the world's most popular media provider. Alibaba is the world's most valuable retailer, whether online or offline. And Airbnb is the world's largest accommodation provider.

                    SmallJobz fits the bill as an interface company, and aims to fill the gap between Alibaba's retail service and Uber's transportation service.
