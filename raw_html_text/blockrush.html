                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original Zelda NES was the inspiration for this game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far we have created a square that you can maneuver using the arrow keys. The goal is to maneuver through the entire maze.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used three different coding languages, html and css for the webpage and javascript for the game itself. We used several resources throughout the process. We used Visual Studio Code as our IDE. We also used GitHub as version control for all our iterations and collaboration. We started by making the website and then went into making the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced several challenges throughout this process;
We built a basic prototype for idea due to time constraints. 
Our original platform for the game, Game Makers Studio was not working. 
Had no prior knowledge or experience with javascript a key language in our project. 
Had no prior Knowledge of GitHub which was essential for our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this process we had to come up with an idea, make the basic prototype for our idea come to life, and execute our idea. We used JavaScript to develop our prototype. None of us had any prior experience with JavaScript, so had to learn a whole new language to make the game. We also did not have any experience with GitHub so we had to learn what that was as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned several different skills throughout this process. We learned how to code in javascript. As well as learned how to use GitHub. We also learned time management and how to work on code collaboratively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BlockRush
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For later development, We will  put in more levels, and environments.
Adding in timers
Brining a rich environment that grabs the player&rsquo;s eyes.
Updates on the level set and having different themes for each level set.
