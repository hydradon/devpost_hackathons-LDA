                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we know what it's like to want to party. We also know firsthand the reality of parties and social events in 2019, a time of increased technology and rapid communication but also a sense of isolation. Having attended parties with friends, only to lose track of one friend before the end of the night, we know today's youth need a method to keep track of friends and alert them if they are in danger. Recognizing a need for solutions to common dangers associated with parties and other social events, like intoxication and sexual assault, we have designed gluu.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    gluu is a web application designed for students and young adults who want to party safely. gluu presents young adults with an effective way to keep a group of friends together through the chaos and excitement. With common-sense, intuitive functionality that enables friends to form party groups ahead of time, keep track of fellow partygoers on a map, and alert friends of danger with the &ldquo;panic&rdquo; button, gluu is a must-have app for anyone who wants to enjoy a night out knowing their friends have their back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, CSS and Javascript serve as the skeleton of our app. We utilized the React and Bootstrap Javascript libraries to improve the readability and effectiveness of our code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the help of Standard Library, we employed a number of APIs, including Twilio, IP Geolocation and Google Maps to send text messages and track location, respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    gluu is currently hosted using Google Cloud&rsquo;s Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a database using Firebase demanded hours of work on our end that ultimately paid off!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Implementing Bootstrap within React also proved tricky, but ultimately it was a success!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe this kind of technology can positively impact generations of students. We hope to see this project grow in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to navigate a number of useful libraries, as well as implement APIs to perform powerful functionality using Standard Library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of our team members&rsquo; skills improved measurably!
