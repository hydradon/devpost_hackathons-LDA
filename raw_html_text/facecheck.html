                        <strong>
                            Testing integrity in the classroom:
                        </strong>
                        Most colleges across the country manually have to scan and id students individually to prevent fradulent behavior such as having someone else take the test for them. The current solution is optimized for this task.

                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Attendance in schools:
                        </strong>
                        Because this system can identify multiple individuals in the frame of the video, the teacher can easily take attendance without manually calling out or recognizing the student.

                        <strong>
                            Enforcing drinking laws:
                        </strong>
                        It's common for those under 21 to use another person's ID card in the hopes that the bouncer or cashier will not notice. This system prevents mistakes and bias by providing a quick and accurate authentication service.
