                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone of us have always had a hard time when it comes to memorization. A common method that people use to help memorize certain things, is by asking friends to test them. So we decided to make a google action application that allows everyone to utilize this method, without any of the hassle involved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This google action acts as the 'friend' that helps test your memory, and gives you feed back on how you can improve, through various statistics, and immediate responses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the google action using dialog flow to make our intents and firebase for our backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we had was learning how to effectively handle user experience for voice-only applications. This was challenging because, unlike mobile apps, a command can be triggered multiple different ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to develop an application for the google home mini that can be used by everyone in their daily lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main thing we learned was how to design and develop actions for the google home. We also learned how new this area was and realized the potential in this area of user applications.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next major goal for this application, is to be able to interpret emotions.
