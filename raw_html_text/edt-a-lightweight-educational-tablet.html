                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technology in schools today is given to those classrooms that can afford it. Our goal was to create a tablet that leveraged modern touch screen technology while keeping the cost below $20 so that it could be much cheaper to integrate with classrooms than other forms of tech like full laptops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EDT is a credit-card-sized tablet device with a couple of tailor-made apps to empower teachers and students in classrooms. Users can currently run four apps: a graphing calculator, a note sharing app, a flash cards app, and a pop-quiz clicker app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    -The graphing calculator allows the user to do basic arithmetic operations, and graph linear equations. 
-The note sharing app allows students to take down colorful notes and then share them with their teacher (or vice-versa).
-The flash cards app allows students to make virtual flash cards and then practice with them as a studying technique.
-The clicker app allows teachers to run in-class pop quizzes where students use their tablets to submit answers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    EDT has two different device types: a "teacher" device that lets teachers do things such as set answers for pop-quizzes, and a "student" device that lets students share things only with their teachers and take quizzes in real-time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built EDT using a NodeMCU 1.0 ESP12E WiFi Chip and an ILI9341 Touch Screen. Most programming was done in the Arduino IDE using C++, while a small portion of the code (our backend) was written using Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially planned on using a Mesh-Networking scheme to let the devices communicate with each other freely without a WiFi network, but found it nearly impossible to get a reliable connection going between two chips. To get around this we ended up switching to using a centralized server that hosts the apps data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also ran into a lot of problems with Arduino strings, since their default string class isn't very good, and we had no OS-layer to prevent things like forgetting null-terminators or segfaults.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EDT devices can share entire notes and screens with each other, as well as hold a fake pop-quizzes with each other. They can also graph linear equations just like classic graphing calculators can.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Get a better String class than the default Arduino one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Don't be afraid of simpler solutions. We wanted to do Mesh Networking but were running into major problems about two-thirds of the way through the hack. By switching to a simple client-server architecture we achieved a massive ease of use that let us implement more features, and a lot more stability.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EDT - A Lightweight Tablet for Education
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More supported educational apps such as: a visual-programming tool that supports simple block-programming, a text editor, a messaging system, and a more-indepth UI for everything.
