                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had heard about many college/fresh-out-of-college people who were struggling with finances and repaying student loans. So, we decided to create a web app that quickly lays out a monthly budget for people to follow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, users enter their financial information, and the program runs calculations to lay out how much the user spends on categories such as food and utilities, monthly. In addition, it calculates how much users should set aside for savings/emergency fund/checking, and how much income they would have left over for luxury. Users can rest assured knowing that their data will not be stored in any shape or form, so it is a quick and easy one-time budget that users can save.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the open-source library, Vaadin to create a layout that would be automatically transferred onto a server as a webapp. We initally coded it on Eclipse, and then we used a tomcat local webserver to test it out. We then exported the package into a WAR file and used AWS elastic beanstalk so that any computer can access our webapp with our domain.com name (BUD-get.net).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The syntax for Vaadin was similar enough to Java GUI's (which we previously knew) for us to use it as beginners, but we still ran into trouble coding the main layout. In addition, it took us time to decide what applications to use because as beginners, we were unsure of what program or even interface (website or mobile app) would be best for our program. We eventually decided on a webapp, and we are very proud of our final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest accomplishment was getting our product to work, because it was everyone's first hackathon. Through the night, we worked to figure out methods that we did not know how to use, and researched about financial budgets, and we are very proud that it culminated into a functional webapp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this process, we learned about Vaadin, which is a very useful tool for easily creating products with minimal knowledge of the html/Javascript language. We also learned about managing a budget, and to never spend all your money on food. But most importantly, we learned to stick through and be persistent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quick Budget
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For Quick Budget, we hope to use the CapitalOne API to provide a more personalized and accurate experience for users by analyzing transactions. In addition, we want to expand the program to create accounts for users so that  they can update their budget as their lives progress.
