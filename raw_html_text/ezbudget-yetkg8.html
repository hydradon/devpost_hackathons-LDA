                    We wanted to make an ease-of-access site that can calculate your expenses and helps you budget your money
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made it using Python, as we listed out all of a person's daily expenses and helped them budget through knowing their salary. We also made it accessible to calculate other costs to make it more realistic and usable. Our website was created in order to reinforce the code and make it easier for consumers to view. We were inspired by our parents' own expenses and how they can budget their money by using an easier and more consumer-friendly method.
