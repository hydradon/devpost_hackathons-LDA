                    While there are many applications currently out there for scheduling larger events, scheduling more casual events such as studying or meeting up for coffee can often prove difficult, as complicated schedules can prevent groups of friends and people from easily planning events.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Social Hour will be an application that mitigates these problems by allowing users to add friends and join groups, sharing certain details regarding their Google Calendar data in order to facilitate both casual and involved event planning.
