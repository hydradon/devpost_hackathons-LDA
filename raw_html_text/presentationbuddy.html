                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presentation is an important component of the professional world. Creating and presenting a presentation that effectively communicates your purpose is critical in order to share your ideas. We created presentation buddy to help people improve their presentation skills and share their ideas in a professional manner.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presentation Buddy is designed to give real-time feedbacks to presentations. Users can receive feedback about their facial expression, as well as useful presentation tips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Presentation Buddy is created using flask. A smile meter is created in the video stream with OpenCV. Whenever the user smiles, the smile meter increase and when the user does not the meter decreases.
The tips and timer are made through javascript. The tips are synced with the timer and changed every 5 seconds.
                </p>
