                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration mainly comes from the fact that Sogeti was using a heavily outdated system for enabling reimbursements. After speaking to regular users of the system, we found that they were wasting way too much time than necessary for claiming their expenses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application has a simple and intuitive user interface, for making our user has a smooth experience when claiming their expenses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We make use of OCR to automate most of the forms that have to be filled. We also have a system which, based on previous declarations, can determine whether expenses should be manually checked or not
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have improved significantly in terms of ease and speed compared to the previous system
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ReimburseMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to connect ReimburseMe to Google Assistant for an even more automated and seemless experience
