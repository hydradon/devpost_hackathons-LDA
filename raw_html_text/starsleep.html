                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The poor sleep our peers and we get due to distractions and get carried away.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For now, it is a tab that tells you the time. In theory, it is supposed to take input and set a timer for when you want to sleep. Then you would get notifications a set time before and it would continue on an hourly basis afterward. In the new tab, there will be an update on how many hours you have left for your sleep schedule to encourage you to sleep. This way there is a visualization of the injustice we sometimes do to ourselves in staying awake. When we can confirm that we slept the allotted time we will add in as many stars to the new tab as hours we slept.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a lot of source code and documentation. We first built the extension, then worked on opening a new tab. After that, we focused on web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we faced was making the chrome extension. We had to do a lot of research and read a lot of documentation on google API. Then, we needed to figure out ways to store data that was challenging. Then, manipulating time for timers challenged us.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first time coding for one of our members and the first hackathon for another. So, just being there and learning as much as we did was awesome. We are also proud of our clock!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about chrome extensions and their many capabilities. We learned about storage for google extensions. As a team, we learned about HTML, CSS, and javascript. We also learned about JSON in terms of extensions. We learned about how to get the current time from javascript. We also learned a lot about team collaboration and dealing with stress when it comes to code.

                    What's next for StarSleep
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In future iterations, we would want to make the stars earned form constellations when they are added. We would also like to have a taskbar.
