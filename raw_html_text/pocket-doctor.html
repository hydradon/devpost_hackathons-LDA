                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pocket Doctor allows users to take pictures of potential cases of melanoma. It then takes and analyzes the picture in order to determine if the condition is nothing to be worried about (e.g: a regular mole) or if it is potentially dangerous.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React Native for the application development and Microsoft Azure to help us create the part of the program used to analyze the images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing the program to analyze the code and output results with a great degree of accuracy was a challenge. Converting a fairly large amount of pictures into data that we could work with also presented its own difficulties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get a success rate of just under 80% in distinguishing between benign conditions and dangerous ones. Linking the picture taking to the analysis functionality and putting it all into the form of an application is something we&rsquo;re proud of us a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn how to develop apps with React Native in order to create this project. Some team members learned front end development while others picked up further back end skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next for Pocket Doctor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;d probably polish the application up for a better user experience and we hope that people might be able to utilize our app in order to catch cases of melanoma faster and perhaps handle it better.
