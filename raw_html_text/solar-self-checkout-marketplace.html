                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        This project solves the Schneider Challenge and was inspired by the industry need for a fully automated platform to become a catalyst to speed up the adoption of solar energy. This project is also inspired by our own company&rsquo;s (Dvinci) customer centric model and the desire to simplify the process from A-Z.

                    <strong>
                        The platform has integrations to obtain consumer utility data, process the information to accurately design a system that is matched up with their usage, choose a variety of finance options from a variety of financiers, apply for option with credit check, choose a local installer, and schedule all site visits needed for assessment and installation. The platform provides a full customer facing interface that not only guides them through the process of going solar, but allows them to monitor their system, submit referrals and get paid for them, submit a commercial project, monitor their system, inquire about and initiate the process for battery storage for their system, and view a database of FAQ&rsquo;s. As a dual use, installers can also utilize the platform to track data and become a registered vendor.
