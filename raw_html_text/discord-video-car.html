                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entertainment of dozens of people sending commands to a robot, trying to get it to move around successfully
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users in a discord server can see a livestream of the area in front of the the car. They can type !forward to make the car move forward and !back to make the car move backwards
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a raspberry pi to control the motors and camera using Python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wasted a huge amount of time just getting into our raspberry pi because we didn't have a monitor and it was hard to find the pi on the network with dozens of other people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also spent a huge amount of time soldering a complicated h bridge circuit which turned out to be completely useless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also spent a long time trying to figure out how the motors worked but it turned out they were just weird because we were testing with a faulty Arduino
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The car body is pretty nice despite it being made of popsicle sticks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    you can't just flip an N type transistor to make a P type, logging into a raspberry pi is really hard when you don't have a monitor, how to do GPIO and PWM in Python on Raspberry Pi, how a hackathon works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Discord Video Car
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Need to add more freedom of movement (multiple speeds, better turning), get rid of the ethernet cable (replace it with wifi), run the car off batteries instead of a plug, a more user friendly/nicer discord interface, ultrasonics to avoid hitting walls
                </p>
