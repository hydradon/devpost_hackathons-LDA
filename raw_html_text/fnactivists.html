                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We met the team at FiscalNote and were absolutely inspired by their mission. What's further, however, is how incredibly extensive their approach is to analyzing and documenting the legislative process through data. We were really excited to build our app as a result of our conversation with them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The iOS app serves as a method for users to learn about legislation pertaining to their interests. Users can include "tags" and bills that align with these tags will be available daily. Further, push notifications for updates will go out each morning, further forcing the constituent to engage with new bills on the floor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the RESTful API in Python / Flask hosted on Azure, with a simple SQLite database to manage users, tags and recently viewed bills. The iOS app was built in Swift, using Storyboard for dynamic layouts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges included the frequency of requests we were making to the FiscalNote API - we were making an aggressive number of requests for data, so we had to work around this. Further, determining the best way to display the data to the end user was a challenge that we had to strategically solve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we were able to parse through the incredible amount of data to extract exactly what was needed for the end user, no more no less. Further, determining how to engage the user with it was also a great win.

                <p>
                    Jay got some more backend practice in Python, and Jeet worked with iOS for the first time in a while and got used to new libraries!
