                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We arrived at the hackathon not knowing many people and it is relatively tough to start a conversation. Having an App that enhances the networking experience by matching people by interests, might foster communication and meetings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackers can shake their phone to get the profile of other hackers including picture, name, and interests. 
A simple 'Hit me up!' button is the next step to starting the conversation in the app directly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We fully built it with Swift. We all downloaded XCode and wrote the first line of swift the night before. 
We also used the Artsy API to get hackers' social interests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a terrible time sorting bugs and learning Swift's basics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working App!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really learned how XCode works and Swift's syntax and logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Brainify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we hope to get the App working with a real hackathon's database. Also, obviously after enhancing the UI, we would love to integrate some Machine Learning algorithms to find the best match for the hackers based on interests.
