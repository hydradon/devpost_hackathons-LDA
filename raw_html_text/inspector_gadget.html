                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next quarter i will be taking the computer security class and a graduate level class on disassembly/binary analysis so i wanted to learn more about the low level aspects of computer security.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When using ROP, an attacker uses their control over the stack right before the return from a function to direct code execution to some other location in the program. This looks for specific combinations of instructions called gadgets which will do this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is written in python using capstone disassembly framework
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first i tried using regular expressions for finding multi line patterns, but that didnt work out.
Initially i was planning to use objdump, but i didn't like the way it would output the disassembly.
Also getting the files to properly disassemble with intel syntax correctly using capstone was hard at first.

                <p>
                    This can search for and find specific instruction combinations which can form useful gadgets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about x86 assembly code, disassembly, calling conventions
                </p>

                <p>
                    Improving the user interface and adding a more interactive search so users can find new gadget chains easily.
