                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our mockups on Azure and used HTML, CSS for the styling. We learned about how Ontology could help create smart contracts. We learned about how NEM could help with customs document verification using transaction hash. We learned about how XYO could help with tracking of shipments. We would build a bridge among these three blockchains for the platforms to work together.
