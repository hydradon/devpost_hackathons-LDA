                    WhereAbouts was first conceptualized at the 2015 DC Hackathon Event at Cvent World Headquarters. Rahul Ramki, Rahul Kumar, Chaitanya Gupta and Amey Raj Gupta came up with this idea after Chaitanya recounted the difficulty he had finding the Headquarters. Chaitanya had trouble understanding the instructions given to him by Rahul on the phone. When we heard this anecdote, we came up with the idea for an app that sends the user's location to another and establishes a navigatable route between them.

                <p>
                    When a person goes to the WhereAbout app, he or she has two options. He or she  can either click generate code and then send the generated code to the person who he wants to come to him or her. If he or she wants to go to a person, he or she can input the person's generated code and find their location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is useful in a variety of situations. For example, a common problem in fire-rescue situations is that it is hard to navigate a path from people trapped in the firey building to the Firefighters. With WhereAbouts, the firefighters can simply put in the PIN sent to them by the people being rescued and the app will locate a route between the firefighters and the people they are rescuing.

                    This app is also useful in hostage situations. Policemen going to save the hostages often have no idea where the hostages are being kept. With WhereAbouts, a hostage simply has to click the Generate Code button and text the code to authorities. The authorities then know where the hostages are being kept and can act accordingly to free them.

                    PROBLEMS WE RAN INTO
                </h6>
                <p>
                    We ran into troubles integrating the code to send locations with the app.

                <p>
                    However, we managed to create a simple, user-friendly interface for Whereabouts.

                    IMPORTANT LESSONS WE LEARNED
                </h6>
                <p>
                    We learned that challenges are everywhere and they need to be worked on

                    FUTURE PLANS FOR THE WHEREABOUTS
                </h6>
                <p>
                    We expect Google Tango, a virtual platform, to become cheaper in a few years and we will integrate this with WhereAbouts giving it depth. We also want to fix the interface as it keeps on glitching.
