                <h2>
                    Inspiration: We try to find a new way to reduce the delivery cost for people who wants to buy on online stores.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It join the people who wants to send packets with a low cost and that they dont have trouble with the time of arriving like some poeple who can buy in "Mercado Libre".
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: We create an interface where the people can check the next deliveries, you can access from de web page in your computer, from small devices and smarthphones and also we create an app, were you can check the same information, also you can have acces with your facebook account, either way, it doesnt matter if  you are using the app or the explorer, and all that using android studio, xampp and boostrap.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: We have trouble trying to find the way to use the API of facebook, the network problems, the trouble that we had when we wanted to use the free domain, that we didn&acute;t know until the last hour that we should buy it using the private windows of the explorer
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: That we learn a new ways to do what we like to do, helping always from each other, and trying to reach as high as possible considering that is the first time for the 4 of us to came to an event like this.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: To use the facebook API, some of us how to use PHP, how to do a right desplay and new tecnies of the android programing.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Envipack: Make an agreement with buy-sell companies like MercadoLibre, Amazon etc. creating a new way to share expenses between people and for that we have to create the apps for Apple and Windows Phone, make and improve all the modules of the wep page.
