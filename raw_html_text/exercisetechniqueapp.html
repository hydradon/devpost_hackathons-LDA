                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When trying to learn techniques for judo promotions it was frustrating to have to look up a technique every time I couldn't remember a name. I'd have to find a description and video each time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Conveniently gathers all of the different techniques into one app that has a description of each as well as an embedded YouTube video of the technique being demonstrated. It also contains information for exercises such as stretching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android-studio and android emulators to develop the app. Our code was written in java and xml.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially struggled with creating the application since we had never created an app before even though we have a decent amount of coding experience. Due to this we had to spend a lot of time researching how to do different things that we wanted to, as well as how to work with Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having successfully completed our first app and having all of the main information we wanted to include actually be in it was cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to create an android app and work with android studios. How to embed YouTube Videos into apps and work with the YouTube API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Judo Exercise App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving forward we may add more exercises not just those related to judo as well as improve the UI. We made sure that the styling wasn't completely terrible but it definitely wasn't as aesthetically pleasing as we could have made it.
