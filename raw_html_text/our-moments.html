                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wouldn't it be cool if you could create a group of people which you could share a photo album with?
How about a photo album that all your friends help to make adding each one their own unique experiences?
With "Our Moments" you can do exactly that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Our Moments" allows you to build a photo album using all your friends pictures. You can invite as many friends as you want and each one of them can add their own photos to the album. 
The outcome is a unique ever changing combination of experiences from you and the people that you care the most.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a back end in Node.js and MongoDB that takes all the pictures and stores them in a database. The client in Android allows users to create, share and upload photos into albums.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with bitmaps and byte arrays in Android was the main challenge we found during the 30 hours. Image scaling and storing might seem a very basic task, but combined with memory management and user interface, it becomes quite tricky.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get a back end and client side prototype running within the time frame. Although the time was limited, we were surprised of the outcome of the application both in the back end performance and user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never underestimate the power of coffee.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Our Moments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning to make the necessary modifications and improvements to get the application "Store Ready" in the next few weeks. 
We see "Our Moments" like something that people will enjoy using just because of it's simplicity and effectiveness.
