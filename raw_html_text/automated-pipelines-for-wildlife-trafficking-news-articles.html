                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really like the problem statement that the Wildlife Conservation Society wrote up about news article data. I was inspired to make this process better because of my current career. I advertise myself as a Software Engineer (I wrote code), but my formal title is Data Engineer. I deal a lot with writing robust code to process petabytes and petabytes of data in an efficient way. WCS's problem seemed like a very satisfying data process to solve that would allow them to tell stories about the data they discover in wildlife trafficking articles faster.

                <p>
                    My solution includes a few things:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Pulls text data from news articles related to specific key words using Python, Jupyter, and the newsapi.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Derives new contextual data (like identifying if the article talks about a particular wildlife organization or a particular country's name) from the raw news article data using Natural Language Processing methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stores the raw data and the NLP data in a Postgres database.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Makes the data in that Postgres database available through Apache Superset, a dashboarding tool.
                    </li>
                </ol>
