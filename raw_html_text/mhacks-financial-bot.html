                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Discord a lot, and we thought the best way to incorporate Goldman Sachs API with something that we were familiar with was to combine it with Discord's API for making a bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sending a message with a certain prefix (a command, in this case with prefix '!') prompts the bot to output information using the parameters specified in the original command. The commands that we currently have output the growth and integrated scores, financial strength of returns, and multiple score for a company.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My team and I built this Discord bot in Node.js. In order to effectively collaborate with each other, we used a website called 'Repl.it', a site which allows us to simultaneously work on code and run the code straight from a browser using a VM. We used 2 main APIs, Discord.js and GS Marquee.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were actually a few variations of our project, originally thinking about making an entire finance app in Android Studio. The problem this posed to us is the lack of effective collaboration, basically leaving one person to do most of the coding. We finally changed our idea to a web based Discord bot which functions off of user-input and Goldman Sachs API.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully figured out how to get data from the Goldman Sachs API in JavaScript, a language that none of my team is familiar with (myself included).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually learning a lot, starting with the fact that we coded a Discord bot in Node.js without knowing the language beforehand. In addition, we learned how getting data from an API works using oauth and HTTP requests. These skills can easily transfer over to other languages.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps are to add more functionality to the bot. We would like to add numerous features, such as getting portfolios, hedging, etc.
