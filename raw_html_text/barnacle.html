                    for years now. However, AACs tends to be traditionally paper-based and so, may require the child to organise an insurmountable collection of symbols for use. To address this problem, several assertive software solutions were developed such as

                <p>
                    Therefore, I present a free app-based solution which leverages artificial intelligence to convert symbols to voice, and demonstrates a proof-of-concept for parents and schools a like.

                    So why this AAC in particular? I explored open-source alternatives such as

                    . However, #Soyvisual has a consistently beautiful design which makes use of 3D objects (this is helpful when comparing symbols to real-world objects).
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is no surprise why #Soyvisual is a magnitude above the other options given that it was funded by the telecommunications giant, Orange. Therefore I was happy to adopt it for the project.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although #Soyvisual offers iOS and Android apps for its symbols, it has no English version at all. About 400 million people speak English as their first language. In addition to being widely spoken, English is by far the most commonly studied foreign language in the world with around 600 - 700 million English as a foreign language speakers. Therefore, with 1 billion total speakers of English, it seemed unfair to deprive AAC users of #Soyvisual due to a language-barrier. So the task was now to translate the images. All 3000 of them. Much to my relief, this was possible thanks to exporting a pre-compiled library on
                    <a href="https://www.pictoselector.eu" rel="nofollow">
                        Picto-Selector
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, Barnacle goes beyond #Soyvisual's apps by using IBM Watson's speech services to make the symbols speak in English.

                <p>
                    I want to expand the symbol library. Although the licensing terms of #Soyvisual also dictates that my project cannot be commercialised unless I negotiate with the Foundation. Stifling the ability to make money may cause a challenge for the long-term health of the project. Here's what I have in mind for future features:

                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Listening mode (Barnacle will listen to what is being said and convert audio-&gt;text, and then text-&gt;symbol)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Conversation mode (The user can finally communicate with the outside world by using #Soyvisual to speak. Barnacle will then invoke the listening mode and present what is being said to the user in symbol form.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Contextual symbol groupings (perhaps we can leverage deeper AI features by grouping symbols in a contextual manner based on the conversation)
