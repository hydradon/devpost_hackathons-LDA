                <p>
                    As high school students, we're stressed out all the time. Bitcamp is no exception - so we decided, why not make an app to help calm us down? We're also avid gamers, so we decided that gamification was the way to go. We took a bunch of cool stress-study tools, including sentiment analysis with journals, heartbeat tracking through the camera, Thayer's model and a survey, as well as a sleep tracker. These activities garner points that can be accumulated to power up a bitcamp fire to keep it burning!
