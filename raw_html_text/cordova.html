                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired because we didn't have any other ideas
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It makes memes. Lots of memes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML Canvas to draw images, and arrays of words to get text to put on them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges trying to put memes on top of memes, but eventually we figured it out. Also reading text files with javascript is hard. Buttons are even harder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of putting memes on top of memes for the memes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned never to use buttons again &gt;.&lt;, but also how to use Canvas in HTML to draw images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cordova
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to make the memes even more memeful.
