                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My objective when brainstorming was to find an idea that had the potential to solve a widespread security issue in technology.  I had initially tried to create solutions that would be implemented by the end user.  Eventually, I realized that improving the overall security of the networks on which user devices operate could be just as, if not more effective.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the combination of a software and hardware element, openSec allows all local network traffic being sent over WiFi to be encrypted.  This nullifies a wide variety of attacks hackers may try to use to access user data.  Some well known attacks that are stopped within the local network by openSec are man-in-the-middle and eavesdropping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OpenSec has two components:  hardware and software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hardware package is a small device that acts as a VPN server.  It connects to the existing local network for easy installation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each client device will install a lightweight proprietary VPN client app.  For users, it is as simple as scanning a QR code, and their device will be connected. The app is small enough that it will install in a matter of seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project started with the basic idea of: "Hmm... why isn't public/private key encryption be used beetween routers and devices for secure communication.  I thought I might be on to something when I realized that the existing network protocols do not support this kind of interaction between routers and clients.  I continued trying to find ways to encrypt traffic within a local network in a secure manner.  Eventually, I discovered that I could use VPN protocols to accomplish this goal.
                    <br>
                    My attempts to figure out a user-friendly way of connecting to this secure service also took a while.  I had initially hoped that QR codes would be able to call methods from Android and iOS APIs, allowing for the easy (and instant) setup of a VPN client through their respecitive systems.  Unfortunately, this method did not seem possible.  After a bit more research, I decided that the next best thing would be to have a QR code point to an app that would handle the VPN service.

                    <li>
                        In theory, this product works, has a profit model (selling phyisical devices), and solves a glaring issue with tech security.  OpenSec could conceivably be put to market today and would infinitely improve the security of public WiFi networks.
