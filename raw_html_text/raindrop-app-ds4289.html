                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired and aspiring to build a platform which addresses the technological and educational gap in developing regions, and create solutions which integrate emerging technologies such as blockchain and decentralized finance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facial Recognition Authentication

                    Onboard New Users in Developing Markets

                <p>
                    The Raindrop.app is a conceptual platform to onboard new users into the crypto ecosystem, without having to have ownership of physical hardware. A new user can borrow a neighbor or friends phone, then access the Raindrop.app webapp on the browser, and create an account with facial recognition. Once the user account is created, the raindrop accumulation begins. Raindrops are a basket of cryptocurrencies/tokens which are deposited over time in a user's account with Elliptical Curve long term distribution. Once a reasonable amount has been accumulated, the user can export to an exchange or the wallet of their choice. The educational aspect is that new users are exposed to different and new blockchain projects, exchanges, and wallets, as well as other services that can be integrated such as ordering KONG cash loaded with their cryptos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The NFT features will allow for interesting use cases, example: organizations such as UNICEF, KIVA, etc. can distribute vouchers for tuition and education to geographic specific locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also launched a cryptonote fork with premine parameters as a use case for tokenomics design with Raindrop distribution mechanics.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cosmos SDK uses the Auth module to store the facial recognition data. We used the Zoom SDK to compare that facial recognition data to a live scan providing facial recognition authentication.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of interesting challenges, such as being down a laptop (from a car breakin in the city a few days prior) and having to wait for stores to open to buy a mouse after a different laptop's mouse broke. Shoutout to table E4 for letting us use a USB drive to repair the operating system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel that we have accomplished developing a concept that can help address the technological gap and educational gap in developing markets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is difficult to build cool stuff you imagine in an extreme narrow time frame.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Raindrop.App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to rollout our distribution strategy for UniBitX, and invite other blockchain projects to participate in our Raindrops.  We will campaign in West Africa through the Blockchain Foundation Africa, which has a presence in Ghana and Sierra Leone. We will also campaign with the Satoshi Center in Botswana.
