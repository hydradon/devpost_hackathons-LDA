                    A lot of university students spend time on coding puzzle websites. It is easy to lose motivation when you solve puzzles on your own, and don't feel encouraged. We want to make coding challenges more exciting and motivating by competing with your friends. We'll see who can code it best!

                    is our online development environment. We present the same puzzle to two opponents who get scored on how efficient their solution is and how quickly they completed the challenge. It brings together everyone ranging from puzzling amateurs to driven technical interview candidates.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Our backend server is built using AWS - Elastic Beanstalk, which is linked to

                    .  We used Flask to connect to AWS and Firebase to store the user data from the website.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we faced was providing intuitive elements for our development console, such as syntax highlighting and test cases. Another difficult component was synchronizing the two opponents to show meaningful progress and status updates.

                <p>
                    We're proud of tackling a web dev project, which some of us were newer to. We also managed to deploy an AWS instance and a Firebase backend, both of which were quite tricky.
