                    At universities, we have witnessed the problem associated with meal points. It's tricky enough to figure out what time you are available to eat at the dining hall. It's even trickier to figure out an exact number of points you need until the end of the semester. Our application calculates the number of meal points you need to get you through the semester. Additionally, we have created a way for students to connect with buyers and sellers within your university for a better merchant exchange. In addition to calculating the number of meal points the user should buy or sell, they are also able to view their university's feed page to find others seeking to buy and sell.

                    Within our application, we utilized PHP to create a functioning university meal point exchange media service. The user can sign into Meal Point Exchange to create a post for selling current points, view meal points currently available for sale, and calculate a possible range of meal plan points for the remaining time of the semester. Our application creates MySQL database store user information. The user is then able to sell unused points and also able to purchase the desired smart-calculated point value for their semester.

                    As a group, we were able to fully communicate and use our chosen technology tools to create a working application. With the use of GitHub, we were able to locally create solutions to our global application's tasks. We utilized various other communication tools such as Slack and FileZilla for a positive application workspace.
