                    When public photographic collections are digitised it takes a lot of time for the stuff of GLAMs to describe the images and then the images are still

                        only searchable by text

                    can do a lot of image categorisation tasks and it would make GLAMs' work with picture collections much easier if
                    <strong>
                        AI image categorisation was also incorporated into the workflow
                    </strong>
                    . There are more and more commercial AI services available, but we set out to create an easy self built solution to do the task.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started to train an algorithm with LIBSVM to detect outdoor/indoor images. The training and initial test images came from Estonian, Finnish and British collections that have been tagged on a crowdsourcing platform
                    <strong>

                    </strong>
                    . Later we also retrieved images from

                        Digitaltmuseum.no
                    </a>
                    to test our algorithm.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had little time and we not able to perform image segmentation that would probably have given better end results.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got results with around 65 % accuracy! This is not too good but still for first phase categorisation it is helpful.
