                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My parents have high blood pressure which requires them measuring blood pressure every day. Currently, they always have to look for pen and paper to keep track of their blood pressure every day which is very cumbersome. They also have to bring the blood pressure log to the doctor when they visit the doctor. The doctor will then look at blood pressure log to determine the prescription.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Log blood pressure using voice without needing to find the pen and your notebook. It also warns you whether you have high blood pressure base on what you log. When visiting doctor, you can tell Blood Pressure Logger to send you a CSV log to your email.
