                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website is inspired by the layout of popular sites like Apple.com and Nike.com but built with the contents of the current Shodor website in mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website redesigns and simplifies the current webpage Shodor hosts. We noticed a trend that they would link the same websites multiple times so we condensed this to a sleeker platform. We made the navigation system easier to use and reduced the word content per page. We made the site more user-friendly by re-organizing the sections into student, parent, educator so that links are filtered right away to minimize overwhelming information. Also reorganized tabs within student, parents, educator to filter even further by grade level for example
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the backend of the site first then slowly added the HTML pages in. We then built a home page and expanded to include the side pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues from mating the back end in Django to incorporate HTML requests. On the formatting side, our group had to learn HTML from scratch as none of us had any experience before this hackathon. We faced many issues integrating CSS and utilizing the design features to give our site a smooth feel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our entire build was a series of firsts. We recreated a 3d model of the Shodor logo to house an animated version on our website for the first time. We created both a front and back end for a website for the first time, and 3 of our members attended a hackathon for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to do everything on this project; HTML, django and CSS. We learned to create a new idea and work together all night to achieve it. We learned how to properly use git push and git pull. Most importantly we learned if you eat too many awake bars you no longer feel their effects.
