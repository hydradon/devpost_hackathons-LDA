                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired us to create this application is that it's always difficult to find the resources that we need to succeed as students. With our web scraper platform, we are able to find affordable textbooks and tutors that will help students do well in their academics

                    This application will web scrape a platform called craigslist and it'll list out all available information for each postings and lay out information such as price and location of each item.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application through HTML and CSS for the user interface and used python to handle the backend of our application. To host this application, we utilized Google Cloud Platform.

                <p>
                    Some challenges that we were ran into was implementing Google Cloud Platform instead of using a localhost. This was our first time using it so a lot of self learning had to be done.

                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of is the fact that we were able to get our UI up and running so we can put more of our focus on the implementation of Google Cloud Platform

                    What's next for PageTurner is to compile multiple websites in conjunction to Craigslist to broaden the selection that the users can choose from. For instance, we're going to try to have a compiled search result with Slugbooks as well.
