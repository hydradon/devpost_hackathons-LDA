                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our first idea was to create something related to food delivery, since food delivery is a very common and convenient service for everyone. Then, concerned about food safety and consumers' rights, we aim to create a better and healthy food environment for consumers. Therefore, blockchain came to our mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our BlockMarket offers food and grocery delivery using the blockchain technology. The technical architecture is based on smart contracts and hyperledger fabric developed by AWS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Such system allows every transaction to be verified and secured. Also, since blockchain offers a transparent and decentralized platform, any data on the chain can not be altered. 
Under such system, consumers can trace the source of their food and grocery to the factory , and even to the farm. Grocery stores could trace the source of lettuce and verify if it is organic. Therefore, food safety can be closely monitored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The factory, restaurants, grocery stores and consumers can join the network as peer node. When a consumer chooses a restaurant or store and order food, one order is created, and the information is chained on the blockchain. Then a restaurant and store can accept the order and issue a courier to pick up the food. The courier can pull the consumer information from the blockchain, and once the order is finalized, the transaction is completed.
                </p>

                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a blockchain network and added two peer node on AWS. I implemented chaincode using go and node.js. We also developed an html web to order food.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The process of creating a blockchain is complicated and exhausting.

                    how to build a web, a tons of knowledge of blockchain

                <h2>
                    What's next for BlockMarket
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to Implement a iOS version of BlockMarket and further develop the web version of BlockMarket. We can even expand blockmarket from food industry to the entire online shopping industry to ensure consumer's rights and safety.
