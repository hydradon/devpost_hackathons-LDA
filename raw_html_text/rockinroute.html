                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program will take in a route you plan on taking, and find artists that are performing around that route. This helps you find any local artists during your trip and big named ones in town.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program was built using a django backend and integrated with google-maps, spotify, and ticketmaster's api.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reading through all of the various API's documentation and get authentication working was challenging.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The overall project is very complete and am proud of my first finished hackathon project!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I leared a lot more about authentication and interacting with API's I also got to work with google maps and interacting with data that maps provides.
