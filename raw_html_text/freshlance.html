                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is inevitably true that most students' knowledge is wasted. While most students learn many subjects with broader matters, only the knowledge on their expertise are carried over throughout most students' career. Even worse, if students are unable to find a job, their knowledge slowly decays and eventually disappear, and there are so many passionate bright stars who miss their chances to glow. I wanted to explore on the matter of
                    <strong>
                        how we can utilize this wasted knowledge base
                    </strong>
                    . The solution to the matter is simple. We should provide global and organizational support to students through better developed accessible platform.

                    What FreshLance is
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration had led me to building a freelancing website, exclusively for students. Unlike other existing freelancer websites which targets mostly expert customers, the product will target students only which will allow the product to be unique and valuable.
As you would expect, the name FreshLance comes from the combination of Freshman and Freelance.

                <h2>
                    What the website does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once you successfully sign into the website, there are two things you can do, one to hire and one to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a freshlancer, you can build your portfolio by answering some questions asked by the platform. Then, you can update the expected pay for yourself, depending on the project you will get. You can update your profile/pricing later as well. You will also get an option to search/find task postings by a company (to be implemented).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're looking to hire freshlancer, the app will immediately recommend related profiles, based on your search/hire history (recommendation engine to be implemented). Then, you will be able to open up and view the full profile followed by recommendation based on the student's profile. You will also have an ability to post tasks for students to take (to be implemented).

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project mostly focuses on visual elements. Most of the elements were implemented using frontend html/css/js which I got many templates from online. The backend was built with Go.

                    Challenges I ran into &amp; Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges I faced is due to my lack of knowledge in frontend space. In fact, I do not have any previous frontend experience. Getting into the design space, learning to visualize the design, and having to support functionality through the visual elements were painfully slow and extremely difficult process. But, I am definitely happy to carry on with these tasks as it was a very good learning process for me.
Tackling these challenges, I was able to build visually impressive website within 24 hours. I was very proud of myself in which I was able to learn from basics of html/css to building into a successful visualization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I have mentioned, it was a good opportunity for me to learn about frontend elements of the web app. As an engineer with more backend expertise, this experience is valuable as I could understand better about what it takes to become a frontend engineer.
