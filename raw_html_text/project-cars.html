                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from an online game called tank trouble
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It drivse a car using a raspberry pi and arduino. Commands are transmitted over a local area network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we took RC cars, gutted them, and replaced the electronics with a raspberry pi and arduino
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TIME, raspberry pi wouldnt run jar file, height restriction (ceiling)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    getting so much done, server, client system, cars
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we cant do this much in so little time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Cars
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we are going to take it home and see if we can finish it / getting it working
                </p>
