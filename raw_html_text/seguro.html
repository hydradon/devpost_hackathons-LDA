                    Inspiration: With an accelerated technological progress the world is witnessing, it is no wonder our life has been affected by this revolution. It should not be hard to see that with the social medias acting as a means of connecting us all with our every information online, the online stalking has been rising as a major problem. This was an inspiration behind the 'android' version of the 'guardian angle': our app named 'Seguro' that helps people feel safe with the option of contacting the designated members via text, call or even email allowing them to share their location in the case of emergency.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: With the 'Help' button meant for the emergency, 'Seguro' allows people to sent out customized text or even email in case of emergency. We hope to use this app as a method to stay safe with the help of designated friends including authorities (public safety, police). Emergencies can include, but not limited to an event of stalking, drunk incident, etc.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it:We used Java, Android Studio, Xml and firebase to design the application
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Real time tracking using Google maps API due to Google's policies.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: We are proud of how we were able to integrate various APIs in relatively shorter period of time to get the app working.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: Source code control when working in the group, cross platform dependencies between Windows and Linux.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Seguro: We hope to expand this app as a protection application for various universities and college. In a closed environment, the app should prove to be extremely helpful.
