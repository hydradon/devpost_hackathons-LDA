                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Puns, a catchy domain name and a good intention to attract the crowd to events and make them successful.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps college students find events that offer free food hosted on campus. Food is a catchy term for anyone. Especially if it is free, you know the crowd it pulls towards the event. The event suggestions are based on the student location.People who attend the event first hand or the organizers of the event can post upcoming events on the website.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML 5, CSS to create the webpage and mongoDB to host the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know how to do web design, create a database. So, we had to figure out which database tool to use ( MySQL or MongoDB or Microsoft Access). After some google search, we decided that mongoDB goes well with the webpages that needs a small database and we learned the basics of mongoDB. We created a database using mongoDB. However, we had trouble connecting the database to our webpage.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon experience. So, we are proud of the fact that at least we are able to learn the basics of mongoDB overnight and creating the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We understood our technical drawbacks and the skills that we need to develop to build great products. Skills like HTML, JavaScript, CSS and most importantly creating a database are very essential. Hopefully, by the next MLH hackathon we will be competent enough to create a fully working product and demo it flawlessly.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we learn the above mentioned skills we plan to develop the website and make it available to our college students and slowly expand it to other college campuses. Once it gains traction, we hope to make it available to public. In the meanwhile, we will try to port the website into a mobile application (this makes it easier for the people to access the real-time event information).
