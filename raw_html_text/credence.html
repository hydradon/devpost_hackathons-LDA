                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I was part of my high school robotics team, we played mafia all the time, even on the bus or on the go. When we were on the bus we often appropiated facebook messenger for our games, which almost nearly worked, but not quite. I decided last week that since I was broke and probably needed money, that I should probably learn some app development, and boom, this was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It does all the initial steps of setting up a game of mafia, without actually doing it. So right now, technically its just a really basic role spreadsheet.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used flutter and cloud firestore. I prototyped the entire app in figma.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Realizing that the project was due at 12:30 instead of 2:30. I got 8 hours of sleep last night so I don't really? care?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's literally three-four hours before a finished product (I think... lol). Being that this is my first real mobile app, and the fact that it runs on both android and ios, I think that's good enough for something I only started learning a week ago.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flutter and some cool functional dart stuff.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding the messenger component, which is literally just two wireframes. I was literally
                    <em>
                        this
                    </em>
                    close to finishing.
