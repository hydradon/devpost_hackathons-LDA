                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this chatbot because we are terrible at answering emails, and, instead, we are always on facebook messaging people. Basically, individuals are able to communicate with each other freely in a social context--FB Messenger-- decreasing the amount of psychological stress implied upon professional email services. Emily brings forward the solution to this societal phenomenon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emily is a Facebook Chat Bot who facilitates her users to respond to emails in a pressure-free messenger environment. Through secure web authentication, Emily checks which emails have been read but not responded to in the last 24 Hours, and offers users the choice to respond right away or later. If users decide to respond instantly, she then directs them to a new email window, both mobile and web friendly, and provides customized email templates for them. For delayed responses, she offers to remind them in timely fashions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this chatbot using the following technologies: node.js, heroku, mongodb, html5, css3, javascript, and micrsoft's cognitive ai Luis. Though we started with a simple online tutorial on how to make a chatbot, we quickly thought of many other exciting things we could include in our bot!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to link the luis ai into the chatbot. Learning to host something on a domain. Learning to use many new facets of node.js. Learning to set a timed message on our chatbot. Learning heroku's many aspects. Basically, we knew nothing when we started this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We barely knew anything about chatbots when we started, and now Emaily talks to us! Not only that but this is the first hackathon Alina and Tiffany have ever attended and they are amazed by the results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything that we used were things that we were not familiar with or had absolutely no experience with. In addition, we gained some experience with softwares for design such as photoshop, illustrator, and sketch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emaily
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, while users browse through emails via her smooth sliding and interactive carousel platform, they can also collect coupons for their favourite restaurants and shops &mdash; what a win-win deal!
