                    I have a lot of trouble time managing as I have issues with attention and planning and being able to comprehend time. I often lose track of it very quickly. I wanted an app that would be able to quickly and easily allow me to plan out when I could do big assignments that are due at later dates. We learned that it can be quite difficult to set up a database and calenders as well as how different equipment can cause confusion with those around us. We also learned how to use GitHub. We also learned that animation is really hard. We also learned how to send emails out to other people from within the program and we learned a better way to make a calendar. Mamp was also really difficult to work with because it has soo many little intricacies. The database was really hard to program as Mamp refused to work with our programmer and he had to do a lot of work. Calendars also require a lot of work.
