                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked at programming, and thought that there should be an easier way to pick up syntax.  we used developed a block based language to aid young programmers in learning to program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses a C# gui, allows the user to click on the controls, and then move them to the programming line.  once desired components are in the line, clicking the Generate Python Code button generates python code using the text boxes below the blocks as well as the blocks themselves
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used visual studio and C# to develop the GUI and application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working in C#, none of us had experience.  Also working with a gui, as we had minimal GUI design experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system accomplishes everything we set out to do.  and looks nice while doing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C# programming, GUI development.
                </p>

                    What's next for BlockGen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding support for other languages.  test versions we used generated C code as well as Python, but we didnt include it in the final, as we didnt have time to iron out the bugs with C generation
