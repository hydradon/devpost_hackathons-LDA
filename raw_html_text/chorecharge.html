                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have all had bad roommates who don't help out with chores and making sure that the dorm or house is kept in livable human condition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows roommates to keep track of chores and to make sure that roommates don't do an unfairly few amount of chores. Each chore is assigned some monetary value. When a roommate completes the chore, they claim that they have done it (to be confirmed by other housemates). This way, everyone contributes to the maintenance of the house, whether through doing chores or through monetary compensation.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GUI is hard and unpredictable.

                <p>
                    We want to clean up the GUI and move the computer application to iOS and Android (mobile platforms).
