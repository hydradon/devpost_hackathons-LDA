                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration comes from the recent forest fires which are devastating the country of Australia, destroying the habitats of many animals. Through our app, we want to raise awareness to the effects that climate change can have on the ecosystem. Fauna Fund is an interactive ecosystem that the user can draw in real life and have their favourite animals come to life in the virtual world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fauna Fund takes a picture of a drawing of on a piece of paper and renders game objects in a virtual environment that the user can then interact with and learn about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Unity and C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the development of this project, all four group members ran into different challenges. Some include, 3D movement and animations with prefabs, linking android camera to Unity, and optimizing the search and classification algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In general, we are proud that we were able to bring this idea to life. For most of us, it was our first time using Unity's systems to build an app and especially exploring the world of game dev an exciting experience for us all. We hope that our application can help bring awareness to some of the most beautiful ecosystems on earth and drive conservation efforts to keep them around for years to come.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fauna Fund
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further improvements would allow the user to have more options to interact with their virtual ecosystem. Options like feeding, information bios, and links to conservation efforts would all improve the user experience and promote our cause. Additionally we would like to further improve our searching and classifying algorithm to accept a wider range of designs with greater precision.
