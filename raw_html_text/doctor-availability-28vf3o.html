                    Our program is supposed to be a webpage with a calendar in which patients could see the time availability of their doctor and choose one of the time slots. However, due to many complications of group dynamics and several changes in overall topic the project is incomplete. We put a lot of work with no tangible product outputted, this submission is simply to say that we submitted something.
We would like to thank ArchHacks and Washington University for this amazing first Hackathon experience.
