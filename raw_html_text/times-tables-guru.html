                </h2>
                <p>
                    Become a Times Tables Guru yourself with this comprehensive educational skill.&nbsp;
Master the tables over time, record your results and become a real tables expert. This skill has been created specifically to help children develop their table skills, but it can be used by people of all ages including mum and dad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Times Tables Guru helps you steadily build your Times Tables Skills. Learn the tables just by saying the table you want to learn such as &ldquo;Ten Times Table&rdquo;. Then once you think you know a table try answering Alexa&rsquo;s table questions in order, just as you learnt them and then try the same table in random order. If you are new to tables you may like to attempt them in the following order: 1 times table, 10 times table, 2 times table, 5 times table, 11 times table, 4 times table, 3 times table, 6 times table, 9 times table, 8 times table, 7 times table and finally the 12 times table. But that is up to you and you can learn them in any order you wish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want Alexa to track your progress then use one of the 4 available nicknames; mum and dad can track their progress too! You can check on your progress at any time by asking Alexa to tell you your progress for the different skills such as:  learn, in order, random, or count up or down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you feel you have mastered all the tables you can ask Alexa to ask you questions on 2 tables, 3 tables or 5 tables at once. Once you feel really confident you can take the Mega Test which will ask you all 144 questions across all 12 tables. Getting that right can give you the feeling that you may well be on the way to becoming a Times Tables guru.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you approach Guru standard maintain your table knowledge by using the &ldquo;Challenge&rdquo; mode which will test you with 60 questions on 5 random tables. You can also try out the &ldquo;Count up&rdquo; or &ldquo;Count down&rdquo; options where you just count up or down in steps of 1 to 12 as selected by you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Times Table Guru is there to help you and as such it is forgiving, you can skip some answers if you are not sure and Alexa will say what the answer was, then at the end Alexa will allow you to try the questions you skipped and if you get them right Alexa will count that as a table completed correctly (as long as you didn&rsquo;t get any wrong!). If you are not sure what was asked, just say &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; and Alexa will repeat the question without penalty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even Alexa isn&rsquo;t quite perfect and she occasionally confuses 90 with nineteen and 80 with eighteen. And it can be frustrating if you are doing the mega test or a multi-table test and Alexa confuses those terms and decides you were wrong when you weren&rsquo;t! So, in Times Tables Guru, Alexa has been programmed to avoid such confusion for some critical numbers which reduces the likelihood of frustration.
