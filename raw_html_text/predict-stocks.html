                    Our group received inspiration from our love for our mutual love for both stocks and coding. We decided we want to build a website that could serve to help people who also loved stocks to be able to predict stocks based on previous prices of stocks.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Our website allows people to analyze current stock prices such as Google, Amazon, and Apple. It also has a built in server that allows people to put in files relating to the prediction of stocks and people can put in graphs also.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We built the website using Html and we collaborated amongst our group members by using the Google Extension titled Editey. We designed the website using our previous knowledge of HTML. We also built the server using Python PHP.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The server was difficult to create because it crashed multiple times and we faced many errors from the program. However the website was not that difficult to make.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were finally able to get the server to work and also we are happy with our final website product. We believe we came a long way from when we began as our understanding of Python PHP and Html also increased.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We increased our overall knowledge of HTML and Python. We also learned how to further add details to websites, like color and link to websites.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We are going to continue to build on the application to make sure the server is more accurate and the server is more reliable.
