                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the morning, you brush your teeth and get dressed in front of a mirror. Imagine always knowing the weather, being up to date with current news, and knowing what your whole day's schedule is at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A mirror that showcases weather, recent emails, and upcoming events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a localhost site, we coded in python to integrate Google APIs and had a javascript script for the time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not being able to prepare the hardware prior to the event, we spent a large amount of time going out to get supplies for our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have completed our project before the deadline at our (2 out of 3 of us) first hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a great experience and amazing to interact with all the companies that sponsored the event. We learned what it was like to attend a hackathon. We learned how to create a website, code in multiple languages, and attended the workshops available. Even though one of us attended hackathons prior to the event, they were able to learn the new languages and designing frontend in CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for sMirror
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to integrate more customizable functions for the users. We'd like to add a more interactive feature by adding AI assistants like Google Assistant, Siri, or Cortana. Making sMirror cheap and affordable for many to use would be great as well.
