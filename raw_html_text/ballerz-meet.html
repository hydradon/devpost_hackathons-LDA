                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When studying abroad in Barcelona, many of Anna's friends wanted to find places to play basketball and meet locals. Universally people like to find teammates to play pickup sports with.

                    Find people in your area to play pickup basketball with.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio, Google Maps API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having little previous experience with Android Studio caused us to have challenges with quite a few layout elements such as ListView and other elements of XML files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an app that is fully functional and has lots of potential. We think many people would want to use this app and we tried to make it easy to use. We are also proud to have learned Android Development skills and Google API within this past day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to divide up tasks equally based on our strengths and rarely ran into merge conflicts. We also expanded our knowledge of Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ballerz Meet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to create a backend and expand Ballerz Meet to include other pickup sports as well. We also hope to connect the app to social media.
