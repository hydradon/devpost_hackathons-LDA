                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an application that can help reduce photo abuse. Because Snapchat compromises security by allowing screenshots, we wanted to create a solution that increases individual privacy protection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a base prototype that splits an image into partial images so that potential abusers will be blocked from screenshotting complete pictures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using pixi, a javascript library, we built a web app that takes in an image and creates a secure version of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was first hackathon for all team members. In addition, we did not have much coding experience, so we learned an incredible amount from the ground up to accomplish a prototype of our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we worked together and completed a mock up despite all the odds!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We leaned what javascripts is and what it can be used for. Also we learned about the pixi library for image manipulation. We also learned a lot about HTML, HTML5, and canvas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Secure Snap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The back end server for this project is not complete and the UI has to be improved. The algorithm to break up and reassemble the image also needs improvements.
