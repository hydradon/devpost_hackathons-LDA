                    Existing GitHub bounty bots have been doing a great job at incentivising people to contribute to open source! But what they don&rsquo;t do is encourage people to continue contributing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Colony has a bounty-like task system, but with the added feature of reputation. What if as well as (or instead of) earning a payout for completing a PR, you also get reputation? Then this gives you rights to make decisions and control project funds proportional to what you contribute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another way of looking at it is that this bot sets up GitHub as a UI for the Colony Network contracts.
