                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On Friday we were preparing our clothes for coming to the hackathon, we had been preparing everything and we had done the laundry the night before in order to bring our fav physics t-shirt but... the clothes were not dry!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DryOrCry is an interactive website that allows you to compute the among of time that you will need to dry your clothes depending on the weather of the day since the dry process depends heavily on the temperature, wind and the relative humidity as well as the radiation incoming from the sun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interactive website was created using
                    <code>
                        Python
                    </code>
                    and
                    <code>
                        nbinteract
                    </code>
                    and hosted in
                    <code>
                        Github
                    </code>
                    . The weather data was acquired using the
                    <code>
                        OpenWeatherData API
                    </code>
                    . We also tried to include this in a Telegram bot in order to make it more user friendly for mobile phones.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    First of all, this was the first hackathon for all of us and as physics students, we had heard something about interfaces, GitHub, website creation, Telegram bots... but we had not so we decided to learn everything from scratch during this hackathon!
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end, the webpage is not interacting but we still have the JupyterNotebook that accomplishes the interaction and allows you to choose your city.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Since it was our first experience developing an interactive interface, we learned a lot!
