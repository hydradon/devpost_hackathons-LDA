                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw a problem with having to search for the many different conversion formulas all in different places, so we decided to solve this problem by putting them all in one, easy to use app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will convert any base measurement to any other specified measurement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the framework with HTML5, styled it with CSS3, and built the logic of the program with Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to compile the app into an android APK, but ran into problems with Phonegap.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We learned a TON about Javascript; we're still new to the language.
