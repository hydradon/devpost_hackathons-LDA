                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One team member (Arjun) had experience building android game before, so we decided to go into the route of building a simple android game for this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It detects finger motion from players and have the small squares exploding from the place we tapped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio along with some other existing libraries like MotionEvents and StartActivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us are really new to java, so we spent a lot of time googling stuff instead of actually building things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At least we learned new stuff!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The necessary building blocks (in terms of android) for this game.
                </p>
