                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to play around with lightning more and build something that had not been built in lightning before, and a bill splitting app came to mind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Let's a user show how much a bill was and what users paid. Then allows someone to pay their portion of the bill with lightning, and then the original bill payer can redeem via LNURL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it off of the radar boilerplate and then used Reactjs for the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The two biggest challenges it felt like we faced were with local dev env changes (such as databases) and actually finding enough time to work on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're glad that we got some of the core functionality in there and worked well together as a team despite the lack of time we had available. We were glad we got some of the lightning payment / withdrawal functionality in there as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about LNURL, React (neither of us used it much before), and even though we both know about lightning and used it before, it's always nice getting more exposure to it and some of the LND commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LNSplit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue building out the basics and put a nice UI on top of it as well.
