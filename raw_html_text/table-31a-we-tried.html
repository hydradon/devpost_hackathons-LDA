                    As a team, we wanted to create a digital bullet-in board that allows people to post and see events happening in their local community as a tool to help communities foster social good. A user will have the option to either sign up for the service to post events happening or will be able to click on events in each state. The data about the events would ideally held in a dataframe in the backend which will relay results back to the user based on their choice of state selected.

                    The platform was coded using HTML in the front end and Python in the back end. In order to combine the back end to the front end, we used the Flask framework. In addition, the Pandas package also helped to create the dataframe in Python.

                    Reflecting back on the project, we had difficulties implementing the Flask framework which led to multiple set backs throughout the 24-hour challenge. In specific, no team member had prior knowledge of the Task framework which created a large learning curve. As out platform was also connected to a database, it was challenging to implement it the framework to our project.

                    Given the exact same opportunity again, the team would heavily explore using Google Cloud to host the databases as it prevent human errors that impacted the performance of our code. In addition, the roles would be split up better as there were often times when the team was not on the same page and wasted time having to re-understand the code.proud of
