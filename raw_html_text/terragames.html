                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Potentially a game with a shared mathematical surface as a scene. The only ways of playing it will be in multiplayer mode with other people or with AIs. The goal of the game will be to eliminate all the enemies by destroying their base.
