                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had the idea of mapping Monzo data on a map but werent sure how we would take our idea further. On a train accross the country we had our eureka moment! We decided to try and integrate travel journey information from payments into our Map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows a geographical representation of Monzo payments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We planned to gather travel data using a range of different company APIs. However, after some extensive exploration of a number of companies and there APIs we realised that this wouldn't be possible. Our solution to this was to create a file upload option on our website and an email parser to gather travel data directly from customer receipts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had very limited UI knowledge so its been a learning journey.
                </p>

                    What's next for Monzo Maps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating with more companies to show MORE data!
