                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired to finish my ISP implementation by this hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've added on my current Alexa app. A summary of it is, you can add your food and your recipes, ask to suggest recipes and it will suggest based on the food you have in your fridge and pantry. You can also add/edit online:
                    <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/food-tracker/index.html" rel="nofollow">
                        https://s3.amazonaws.com/food-tracker/index.html
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, when you add 5 recipes, it lets you know once you get to 20, you can't add any more unless you subscribe. Then, when you try to add the 20th, it still suggests, and if you say no and try to add a 21st, it will let you know you need to subscribe (or try it for free) to be able to add it.
                </p>

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I used Node.js ISP v1. Using

                    </a>
                    helped me implement.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using thier site helped, but their upsell code had a compilation error, I was debugging it for quite a while-- they forgot the "productId" key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wasn't able to find what request I can call to get the token I need for my website to know whether the user has the subscription. So I just asked the users to add using Alexa, and they can edit as much as they want after using the website.

                    What's next for Food Tracker (V3)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a couple ideas on what's next.
I would love to create a service to email people when their food would go bad, with suggestions on what to make.
I would also love to create the a shopping list on my website, and when you mark as bought, it would go ahead and put that in your fridge/pantry on the shelf you normally have it on.
