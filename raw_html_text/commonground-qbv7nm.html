                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is often for college students and the general populous to search for good places to settle down and have a chat. Many of our group members found meeting up at a good spot difficult, just coming up with places with little to no idea of how accessible it is for all members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Other apps have made it so locations can be inputted and a midpoint location can be found, but it isn't extendable to many users, and requires people to write their inputted locations. Our app allows users to enter a room with other users that want to meet up, intuitively accessing their current location, to find a midpoint location -- like a library, coffee shop, or restaurants. These especially makes it easier for everybody to comfortable get to that location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask on the backend, used a mongoDB database to store user and room information, and HTML/CSS/JS on the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered complications that rose from our integration between our frontend and backend. This included cleanly accessing information from the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the coordinates to correctly display on an interactive math and made a nice looking website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned new technical skills from HTML to Flask and we learned to comincate and delegate tasks. More importantly, we learned how to seek help, and ask good questions to the mentors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CommonGround
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to extend Common Ground by adding a couple more features to help users decide where to meet. A bigger goal would be to add google calendar api to create a when-to-meet and eve add the event to their google calendar.
