                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find fake news and learn valuable skills that will be relevant throughout our lives.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program takes in an article, and parses several keywords.  It then runs a google search for those keywords, and parses the text from the top several results.  Then, the articles are split into sentences, and sentiment analyses are performed on each sentence, with each sentence having a negative, neutral, and positive value.  These values are then collapsed into 2 dimensions and plotted, allowing us to detect outliers.
