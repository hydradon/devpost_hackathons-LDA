                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This year's Game Jam theme on the Junction was "melt", so we made a local competitive game about melting ice blocks and your goal is to outlast your friend with any means possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Competitive couch co-op a fast paced strategy PC game where you are a lava lizard trying to stay on ice that is melting underneath. Problem is your friend wants to survive also. Using all means possible you need to stay on ice and outlast your friend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game plays on PC with controller and keyboard. Move with directional buttons on controller or on keyboard to escape the melting blocks. Push your opponent from the blocks in order to outlast your competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with using Unity and C# language. Graphics are done by Blender 3D and Krita.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was our challenge, because it was shorter than in regular Game Jam.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we got the multiplayer prototype in working and playable to two players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot from blender and texturing with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hot steps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We haven't talked about the future of Hot steps. If we would keep working with the game, we probably would make a longer prototype.
