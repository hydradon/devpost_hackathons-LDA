                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Winter is coming. Our team thought that people would like to know about the weather in the morning before they made their daily commute to work or school. We decided design a device that somebody could keep beside their bedside like an alarm clock but displayed the weather instead of the time.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays the weather forecast when the user gestures over the box.
