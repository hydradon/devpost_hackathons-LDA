                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the fight against crime and harassment, SafeX connects technology with safety by providing features which would help the victim both during and after the assault.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SafeX provides the user to register a hot-word into the application. The application continuously monitors the voice nearby the phone and tries to match the hot-word to that of the speech. On the word match, it triggers an alarm and a series of messages engraved with the user's current location to the user's trusted contacts. Also, SafeX starts recording audio on the word match, which could later be used as evidence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built using the Android Studio taking help of native Android libraries like AudioManager, SpeechRecognizer. We built the UI so that it could accommodate the addition and deletion of trusted contacts. The hot-word can be set/edit by the user at any point in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team being new to Android development had the challenge to learn new things, there was a huge learning curve for the team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technically, the team learned to work with various Android Native services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SafeX
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, SafeX gives out only current location and a custom message on trigger. The idea is to extend this to real time location and video sharing and make the UI much more intuitive and integrate better into other safety aspects of the user.
