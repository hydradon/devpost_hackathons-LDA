                <p>
                    Making clips is subjective and doesn't really have much say in community interaction.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HypeStamp is a two-part extension. Streamers can put a button overlay that users can click during hype moments. We then record the most "hype" moments and timestamp those in a VOD. Streamers, after they're finished, can switch the extension to a panel that displays the most hype moments from their most recent stream.
