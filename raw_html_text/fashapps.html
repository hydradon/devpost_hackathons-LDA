                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the difficulty of finding clothes that align well with our style in an efficient way. Style boxes like StitchFix, Wantable, and FabFitFun accomplish this efficiency, but with a hefty price tag. As college students, we ourselves often aren&rsquo;t able to meet this price easily, so we wanted to create a product sympathetic to this need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many style boxes force users to define their own styles. This can be hard, as most people are often in the middle of the spectrum between different styles, and have trouble defining their style in a binary way. FreeStyle lets users pick pictures of outfits instead of picking a specific word, and shows them possible outfits from popular clothing stores without any commitment or pressure to buy the clothes.
