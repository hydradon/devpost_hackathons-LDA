                    Bias Engine is a web app that analyses new video clips and determines if they are bias towards one side or another.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These days, politics and the world surrounding it are getting more and more polarized. Allegations of fake news and lies are made everyday. Our app aims to detect bias, leaving the viewer is the final judge.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Google API to work properly for large video files was the greatest challenge that we faced. Another challenge we faced was to get the back-end our web app to work. We faced many problems but at the end we finally got it working.

                <h2>
                    Future
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are thinking to add a feature that instead of uploading a video, you could copy a youtube or facebook link. Another feature could be adding more specific political affiliations for different news pieces.
