                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever looked in your refrigerator and thought "fuck, I don't have any salsa"?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Oculus Fridge uses computer vision technology to index items in your fridge and texts you when rations are low, so you never come home to find that you're all out of ice cream. Furthermore, the Oculus Fridge provides shopping suggestions through Amazon.com to make writing your grocery list as easy as possible. The user specifies the number of each item they want in their fridge, and the Oculus Fridge updates the user if they fall below the threshold.
