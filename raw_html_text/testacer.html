                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having hard time finding a group of classmates to study with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows students to meet other classmates so that they can study together for a midterm, work on homework together, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used git, Firebase, Swift, and Xcode to create the iOS mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us have different backgrounds, so it was hard dividing responsibilities and combining our work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just in two days, we have at least managed to create something where students going to the same university and taking the same course can meet together!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about fundamentals of iOS programming, including how to manage asynchronous tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TestAcer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to eventually build a full version of it, as it's always been an app that I've wanted to create since a while ago.
