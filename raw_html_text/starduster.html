                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a game that would both push us technically and be something we could bring to a reasonable level of polish within 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Audio tracks are mapped into stars/notes algorithmically, and come towards the player on 3 tracks: left, center and right. To hit notes, the player must hold the left analog in the direction of the track the note is on, and press the face button of the same color as the note.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starduster was built in Unity 3D, with C# scripting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with solving the problem of mapping notes from audio, which turned out to be a pretty involved process. After some research and trial and error, we got it working!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the overall quality of our game, considering that it was unlike anything we had tried before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned how to integrate virtual reality with game development. For some, C# and Unity was learned from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Starduster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement more songs, and possibly variable difficulty levels.
                </p>
