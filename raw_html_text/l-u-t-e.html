                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A desire to take an old instrument and make it feel new again.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>It is a multi-instrumental platform that is run by a Raspberry Pi and utilizes JFugue to allow the user to play music.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created the code on Java utilizing the powerful and flexible JFugue library. This was the exported to a Pi device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Our lack of experience with the utilization of  complex Java libraries like JFugue led to issues with creating octaves and implementing cords into the unit. When transferred to the pi we encountered a delay to the sound. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>The _ L.U.T.E _  is an easy to control unit that uses simple commands to generate a plethora of musical possibilities. 
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>A greater understanding of the Java language, Raspberry Pi, and the segmentation of work to complete a physical project.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What's next for L.U.T.E
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Features we would have liked to add were: a touch screen interface that would allow customization of the music with extreme ease of access, a playback feature that utilizes the user's sampled work and can then use it as a backing melody, and a unit that could run headless and has seamless playback in this unit.
