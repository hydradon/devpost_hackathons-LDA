                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By showing the physical effects of cutting, providing free resources, and displaying emotional encouragement; Our app aims to alleviate the problem of self harm by taking away the physical danger and addiction in actual self-harm.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest problem was Knowledge based. Because we decided to make a web app so it can be easily imported to a multitude of devices including android, windows, and ios. However in our group two of us had no experience in any language along with one not having very little experience in html, css, and/or JavaScript. 
However the JavaScript did fight back resulting in us having to delete everything and rewrite our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The amount that we all learned: We were able to focus on learning html and for the first time as well as a deeper understanding and knowledge in javascript. This also has gotten us interested in web development as a major.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before this we only knew java, but after going to all the workshops we learned the basics of all the languages and especially html and javascript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We plan on improving the app by adding the swipe instead of the click. We also plan on adding the camera feature to personalize the app and make it more efective for the user.
