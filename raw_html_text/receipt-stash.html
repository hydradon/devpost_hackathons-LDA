                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Receipt Stash was conceived when we got fed up with conventional receipts cluttering our lives. Even a single item purchase would be accompanied by at least a foot of paper. We wanted a better way to keep track of spending, without introducing more hassle into our lives. Thus Receipt Stash was born, designed to make life just a little bit easier, because it is already hard enough.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Receipt Stash stores the information for transactions between stores and customers in a central database and on the users' mobile phones.  After each transaction is made, the customer can scan a QR code or enter their credentials to "claim" the transaction and add it to their account.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our server is running C# as an API to handle requests from the front end website to create transactions and assign them to users.  The website acts as a middleman between users and the server, letting users log in and access their saved transactions.  The Android application shares a similar function to the website, letting users log in, claim transactions by scanning a QR code, and view their transactions in an organized manner.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team members had very little experience in designing and implementing user interfaces and in writing Android apps.  Some specific challenges we had were: getting access to the camera through Android's permissions management system, using Android's SQLite packages to store data on the Android phone in a relatively efficient way, creating schemas for the databases to make our access to the data more easy and efficient.  We also had issues with fully implementing
