                    Do you want to be able to highlight useful words or sentences in online articles?

                    We are Heaps of Fun and we are making a web application that lets you accomplish all these at the same time! In Try It Out, you can copy the articles or texts that you want to read and by clicking ENTER, you will be able to highlight part of the text and automatically copy the highlighted materials into bullet-point outlines on the right. After you are done reading the text, you can click EXPORT to create a Google Doc containing your outline. You can also choose to add more text and submit or reset and start with a new article.
