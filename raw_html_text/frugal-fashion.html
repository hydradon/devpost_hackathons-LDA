                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Browsing through different forums online regarding frugal fashion, I have been able to find incredible deals. However, most of the time, I am too late for the deal. With this monitor, no one will miss a deal ever again.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Notifies user when a clothing article that meets the user's criteria (price, brand, etc.) is found.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front end was created with simple html/css/javascript. The notification system had several components: TWILIO API for sending messages, Firebase for user authentication/account info, Python/beautifulsoup for web scraping to find the deals, Django/Heruko app to create the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twilio API kept saying that my phone number was unverified even though I verified it. Resolved the issue by creating a new account.
