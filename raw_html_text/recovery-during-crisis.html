                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, we often receive alerts on our phone about an upcoming crisis such as a hurricane. But many of us stillfind ourselves stranded with little or no actual help during the crisis. During these troubled times, our brainchild makes it possible to retrieve help as fast as it can.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While in a crisis, this app turns updates the GPS location of the user and makes it available to the user's emergency contacts and first responders. First responders are usually government officials like policemen, fire officers. For instance, in case of an earthquake, we are often not able to find victims in duress. This will show the last recorded location of victims and help maximize rescue efforts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a cross platform mobile application in React-Native using Expo, Xcode, Android Studio, Visual Code Text Editor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not familiar with React native and ran into multiple issues during the setup. Our application requires us to use the devices' GPS location which is not possible on the emulator. Also, publishing apps on the Apple Store requires a developer membership that we didn't have. These issues made it difficult to test our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of building a cross platform app that works on both android and ios. We learnt react native. None of us have used this technology in the past.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt different api's that react-native uses. We learned how to work under pressure. Finish as much as we can within the time limit and focus on the important features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Recovery during Crisis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add a feature that goes through the News report, looks for particular keywords like hurricane, earthquake, shooting in their particular region and sends them a warning about the same. It reminds them they they can turn on the crisis mode on the app.
