                            Lightning-fast blockchain payments without worrying about block confirmation times. Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating a on-blockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured in milliseconds to seconds.

                            By transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Revive Network allows for exceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant micropayments.

                            When using Revive to improve the routing of future payments within a network, the optimal solution under such a denition would therefore be one that eliminates the most skewness in the network where possible.
