                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my friends relies on sign language to communicate and he doesn't want to miss out on the experience of video calling, so I made this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our program is a video calling application that recognizes American Sign Language and converts it to text in real time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We trained a machine learning model with the help of TensorflowJS, MobileNet, and KNN to recognize sign language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Training the model was a challenge because we had never trained our own model before, and machine learning is poorly documented online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of training my own model. That was an interesting (and painstaking) experience, as ML is not very well documented online
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to train my own model! This is my first time doing that. I also learned a tiny bit of Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Talk to the Hand
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we want to turn this into an app to make it more accessible. We also want to improve the accuracy of our model.
