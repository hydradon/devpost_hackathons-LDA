                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile EV charging Infrastructure does'nt have to be a hurdle for EV adoption if there is enough smart way to let users know which charging option is optimal for their current requirement. Currently in the market there are EV apps by the OEM which provide OBD which are focused on optimizing the energy usage of the EV and Apps to show consumer the nearest charging stations. There is a gap in the market for a true consumer experience where the EV owner is not left guessing what the best charging location is

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use Data analytics to combine EV OBD data (Soc, Avg Full recharge times, Temperature of the battery), Location Information, Charging Stations data ( Available Slots, Wait Times , Time to locations etc) we will provide optimal charging option(cheapest&amp;Fastest) for the EV owners.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The App prototype was built using Thunkable. The proposed platform architecture includes IoT integration with existing resources, API for getting Location , maps etc, AWS for data storage , python for Analytics.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mocking up the datasets as close to real life scenario with minimum IoT knowledge.
                </p>
