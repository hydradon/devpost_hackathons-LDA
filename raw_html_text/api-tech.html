                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw that there were so many apis and did not want to have to learn how to interact with all of them, to undertsand their error codes and trouble shoot connections with each individual API creator
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows for a single point of sale and contant for all api requests that you would need. Our marketplace allows API creators to submit their api's at a set price per query and define how the user interacts with their api's
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the wonderful StdLib api system we were able to build the api that can query a database of api providers to provide the user with any api they need
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MongoDB is a bit finnicky to deal with at first, but overall this project was without too many hitches
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both learned the majority of our now okay JS and CSS skills with this project. I believe what we have acomplished given our prior knowlege is nothing short of amazing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to code CSS, JS, make mongoDB queries, send requests and interact with various API's
