                    Khunsa was in need of a mentor and felt that there were others who were in the same position as her. She thought of the app idea to help others who may be struggling to find someone to guide them to the correct career path.

                    The application helps people who want to be a mentor or are in need of a mentor to find someone in their career path. It lets users guide others as well as get career advice from people in their profession.

                    We used Appy pie that helped us with the basic app design and code since we are all beginners with web app development.

                    We ran  into database challenges and LinkedIn API problems.

                <p>
                    This is the first app we have created.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned about web development and all that goes into creating an application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whats next is that we want to expand it to all platforms and add a larger cloud database to store even more records of mentors and mentees.
