                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the Philippines, there over 8 dialects and since it is customary to visit our relatives in the provinces. Unfortunately they speak Ilonggo! There are not much apps that translate from english to Ilonggo so i made one since Google Translate only has Cebuano-English
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently it accepts a .wav file in english and translates it into Ilonggo text
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The model was made using a seq2seq model and a training set of 200+ english to ilonggo phrases. I used nodejs to accept a .wav file that uses Speech-to-text API in GCP and a jupyter notebook that act as server to do the translation with the model
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to acquire the training set as there were no existing ones. Another challenge is deploying the model as the code did not have a compatible model to deploy with Tensorflow-serving. So i improvised and created a microservice embedded in the jupyter notebook that was used in the REST API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that i was able to figure out a way to deploy the model which was coded using  tensorflow checkpoints
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was a challenge to deploy the ML models especially if the training method used was not compatible with Tensorflow-serving. It also require a lot of time to look for available datasets to train the model.
                </p>
