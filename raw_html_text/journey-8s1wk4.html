                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our love and passion for traveling. It is a hobby that I believe does not have enough niche apps in the iOS store. So we decided to add to the community by creating an app that provides the user with itineraries for locations that they would be interested in traveling to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is made to provide the user with any specified itinerary for where they plan to travel including the ability to add the itinerary to their desired "My Journey" tab.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Swift on Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into numerous challenges that we were able to overcome:
1) Creating a gradient color background for the app home screen
2) Adding a navigation toolbar with icons 
3) Text wrapping the labels 
4) Trying to get the images into a slideshow on the Itinerary page
5) We accidentally deleted the entire app right before submitting so we had to find a way to recover it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to overcome all our challenges and make an app that would visually be appealing and providing the user with an experience that further enhances their travel.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to use Swift in an environment that was targeted to mass market appeal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Journey
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking forward to working on the Journey app and progressing it into an app that we can one day release onto the App Store. In order to release the app, we will have to make a few updates such as: connecting the app to a viable back-end server in order to hold account records and personal "My Journeys". Adding a search bar to the map so that users can easily track their locations as well as adding a preferences bar to execute an advanced search. Updating our expanding itinerary collection.
