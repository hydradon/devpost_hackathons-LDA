                    I found the messenger bots rather interesting and i wanted to create something on messenger to help me
keep up to date with my programming skills.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I first created a django restful api backend, a react frontend for the web views and finally i connected them up on messenger.

                    I ran into challenges when trying to deploy my react app to production. React Router wasn't just working for me.
