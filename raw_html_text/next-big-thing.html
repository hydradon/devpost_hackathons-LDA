                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The primary AI model is built with Markov chains. It has been trained on the Devpost project database. The secondary model, currently a work in progress, uses an LSTM model to generate even more natural ideas. We used Python to build the machine learning models, Flask for the web frontend, and the ELK stack for logging. We used ClojureScript for the ToDo list and Docker to containerize the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LSTM's are hard to get right! Also, ClojureScript is rather esoteric and was a challenging choice for this project.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the best ideas are randomly generated
