                    Accomplished
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To date, we have been able to successfully create our website with the basic setup of how we wanted to crossreference buttons and other links between the pages. We set up users who have their own environments, environments have their own observations pages, where you can access all previously recorded data, graphs and so on. We have an example of what the drag and drop interface would look like if it was fully completed. We have a collection of Mongo databases that allow us to access different users, their environments, their observations, and some sample data. We have been using a top of the line reactive web platform called meteor which lets you write apps in 100% javascript. It has allowed us to deploy on iOS and Android instances to see how it looks on a mobile device along with the deployment on the web. Overall, we are extremely pleased with what we have accomplished and look forawrd to continue to work on this project even further.
