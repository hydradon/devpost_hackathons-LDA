                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a group member's experience of having limited resources but being unable to use those resources optimally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alpha Tech Squared uses an algorithm to allocate the listed resources in a way that would maximize consumption and efficiency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an HTML front-end to display the user interface for our web app, and coded the algorithm using PHP and AJAX to bring it all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm was difficult to code since it required efficiency while simultaneously eliminating extraneous solutions. Meanwhile, the UI had to be easily understood while preserving functionality. Finally, AJAX had to be coded to successfully convert PHP to HTML so the front and back ends could communicate
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having code that adequately performs its task to accompany the clean and minimal UI. Most significantly, we stuck with the idea that we were passionate about despite the obstacles and hardships that stood in our way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to ration our time between tasks and streamline our workflow to increase efficiency while meeting the deadline. We learned that not all coding problems can be approached the same way, and that different mindsets must be respected in order to find the correct angle to find the solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alpha Tech Squared
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to implement priorities for tasks as well as scale up the website to meet the manufacturing needs of large companies such as the pioneers of Silicon Valley.
