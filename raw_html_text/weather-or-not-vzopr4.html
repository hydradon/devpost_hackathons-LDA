                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to learn Android development because three out of four members of our team were familiar with Java, and app development is a useful application of our skills.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a combination of tutorials and our own knowledge of Java, we made our app in Java using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Networking, setting up android studio, using the visual editor, finishing in time, lack of organization.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the project and having a project to show off despite the issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most importantly we learned the importance of proper communication in a team. Other things include better organization and getting better at considering other teammates ideas.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The team may work together in the future to finish the application.
