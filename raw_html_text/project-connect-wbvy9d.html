                    What is Project Connect...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Project connect is an idea for a system that connects all main kitchen appliances ( oven, washing machine, dishwasher, microwave, etc...) to an app. The User will often be someone who would want to carry on being independent when their circumstances wont allow it.  This app will allow carers to change settings for the appliances depending on the User's needs. Therefor giving the User their independence and safety back and the User's family the ability to worry slightly less. :-)

                    My Inspiration....
                </p>
                <p>
                    I drew inspiration from my late Great-Grandma, who believed that being independent should be the focus of everybody's lives. Unfortunately as she aged she become more and more confused and forgetful but she always refused and help or support at home.(residential care was never an option to her) She would often leave the gas on or mistake raw food for cooked so we all were constantly worried about her and her determination about not relying on other people.
