                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Selly Oak's crime rates are off the charts, leaving us students scared to walk in Selly Oak alone after a certain time as we don't know what we will face around the corner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user reports crime at a certain area/address. Our website allows other users to view where the latest crime has been committed. This allows them to avoid that area until the emergency services arrives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our website using HTML5, JavaScript, php, mySQL and Google Maps API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project will be able to give UoB students more assurance and hopefully bring the crime rates of Selly Oak down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we were mostly lacking were database and server knowledge as none of us had any prior knowledge. We have also learnt about the Google Maps API.
