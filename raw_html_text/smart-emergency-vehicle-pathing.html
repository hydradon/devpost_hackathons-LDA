                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes a destination and start point and calculates and modifies th trafic signals in the path to provide easy transit.
This is visualized by leds representing intersections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A python script was coded to interface with a database and generate the path.  A feather Huzzah was used to pull the path data from the database and change the lights.  The huzzah also updated the current position of the vehicle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The feather Huzzah has very limited io and because of this the number of intersections was limited.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works and is theoretically scalable with minimal modification for more devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained experience with the Feather Huzzah and also using a database to communicate with multiple devices.
                </p>

                    What's next for Smart Emergency Vehicle Pathing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we would like to add more devices and more some of the abstractions to more real world applications.
