                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were researching and came across a statistic that stated that there are only 6 feminine product non profit organizations, yet thousands of food organizations and drives for the homeless. Because the needs of women are overlooked, many homeless women can't receive the feminine/maternal products they need. This is why we are here to help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps connect women within a community by allowing them to share maternal and feminine products with each other. This then forms a bond so special that it empowers both women. Additionally, we have a city portion of the app where you can find shelters as well as bins to donate any feminine and maternal products you might have (this is also open to our male audiences if they'd like to help as well).

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our website using Cloud 9 and coded it with Bootstrap, HTML, and Javascript.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because of the time constraint given, we encountered the challenge of how we would fit all our content including an app and website into our presentation. Furthermore, we had little website coding knowledge, but instead of using Weebly or Wix, we decided to push through and still submitted a hand-crafted website.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our teammate Hannah had no prior coding experience and as a result, stayed up for 6 hours during the night to code our website alongside Gowri. After Superposition ii, she can now walk away with having skills such as coding with HTML and Javascript.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be expanding the website as well as adding more features to our app, such as receiving ZIP codes for ease of use to see who will donate around you.
