                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I began developing Stat Tracker as soon as I was notified that Amazon was hosting a Hackathon with Alexa! I've had some previous experience with using Amazon AWS Services, and I realized that this would be the perfect competition to broaden my horizons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was able to develop an Amazon Alexa application, as well as a small web-app for users to view their stats at any time. I am incredibly happy that I was able to enter this Hackathon on time, it was a fantastic learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stat Tracker is an application for the Amazon Alexa, with a small associated web-app, that allows users to keep track of any quantitative statistic they would like. How?
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Open a new session:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The most user friendly way to interact with Stat Tracker is open a new session by saying:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            "Alexa, open Stat Tracker"
                        </strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Create Stat:
                </h4>
                <p>
                    If a session has been started, just ask Alexa:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            "Create a new stat"
                        </strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Or if no session has been created, say:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            "Alexa, ask Stat Tracker to create a new stat"
                        </strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After this command, Alexa will ask a couple follow up questions, such as the name and initial value of the statistic.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Change Stat:

                <p>
                    If a session has been started, just ask Alexa:

                    <li>

                    <li>

                            "Alexa, ask Stat Tracker to change a stat"

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After which, she will ask for the name of the stat to change, and the new value of the stat.
                </p>

                </ul>
                <p>

                <h4>
                    Web App
                </h4>
                <p>
                    In addition to the Alexa app, I also developed a small web application that allows users to view and/or edit their stats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can ask Alexa, (if a session has been started):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            "What is my user key?"
                        </strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After which, she will read you a short string that uniquely identifies your device. 
Users can view their stats by going to the following web-app:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://StatTrackerAlexa.herokuapp.com/stats/USERID" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where
                    <strong>
                        USERID
                    </strong>
                    is replaced with a user's unique identification string.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built two small applications for this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        For the Amazon Alexa app:
                    </strong>
                    I used javascript to write code for a nodejs script that is running on an AWS Lambda server. This code contains functionality to connect to a database hosted on AWS DynamoDB. This application interprets user input and makes changes to the database accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        For the web-app:
                    </strong>
                    I used javascript to write code for a nodejs server that is running on Heroku. This server provides a simple front end client for users to access their stored statistics. This code contains functionality for users to interact with their skills on a mobile device or desktop. This application also interprets user input and makes changes to the database accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While developing Stat Tracker, I ran into a variety of issues. Obviously, there are common programming challenges that present themselves in any type of situation, which I ran into. In addition, however, I ran into many unforeseen problems while learning about AWS's DynamoDB. Through my struggles I learned a great amount, and ended up writing better code because of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am simply proud of the fact that I was able to actually complete a project and submit it to this Hackathon. Although the Hackathon was hosted for a long period of time, intense schoolwork consumed most of my time, so meeting the deadline was a goal for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a great deal while developing this application. Primarily, I learned how to make a solid Amazon Alexa application. Luckily, actually developing the Alexa app was easier for me than connecting to the database via the web-app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stat Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stat Tracker has an unreal amount of room to expand. I am sure users can already envision expansions while using the app. I plan on adding different types of statistics, different ways of interacting with them, and most importantly, visualizations.
