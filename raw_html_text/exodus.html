                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by many popular resource management games, such as Dictator, we moved to create a game that had high replay-ability and quick turn arounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each round is a series of 10 questions, ranging from tame to insane.  Based on your decisions, various people will be pleased or dissapointed by your decisions.  But watch out!  If your population dips below 15, you cannot settle a new land!  Also, if the happiness of a group hits zero, there can be many negative effects ranging from losing population to losing the game immediately!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we just started programming in swift and for iOS, we ran into many problems with the background programming.  However, we persevered, and learned a lot in the process!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest accomplishment was seeing the error marks slowly disappearing, and eventually, seeing our hard work appear on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was our first project in swift, we learned a lot about the language itself, in addition to the whole process of creating, designing, and implementing our idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Exodus
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to refine the visuals, and enter more questions.  Then, maybe even moving towards release on the App Store!
