                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every minute spent in the ER can be worth a lifetime for a critical patient. This time-sensitive, fast paced environment is no place for extensive or inefficient paper records, which hinder healthcare providers' ability to devote their time to treating the patient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FindEMS is a web application that transmits patient information, such as demographics and vitals, in real time to hospitals. This allows the hospital staff to become acquainted with the patient record before the patient's arrival, speeding up the treatment process. This application will also allow transport information to be saved into  majority of prevalent EMR softwares.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WE utilized CSS and HTML to develop our front end, and the back end databases were developed using SQL to store patient information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of our team members were unfamiliar with CSS and HTML, and had to learn it on-site to develop the front end of our application. We also struggled with new languages and issues with integrating the different platforms we have incorporated into our application.
