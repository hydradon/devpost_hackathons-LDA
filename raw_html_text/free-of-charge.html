                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The restrictions of electric vehicles(EV) leads to low consumption of 1% throughout the US. This inspired us to develop a solution which will increase the use of electric cars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We generalized a theory that in the future, portable batteries would be used to power cars. If you are an electric car owner stuck in an unfortunate circumstance where your car batteries have run out, you can ask your google assistant for help, which will search for cars nearby, and reroute you to a website with a map of all nearby EV's. The assistant will then contact the nearest car for help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the use of Google Maps API and their feature of geolocation, we were able to create a map with the location of the nearest EV's using their coordinates which were found through the ESP8266. The values of the coordinates were stored on the Firebase and used to launch them on our website through the help of FileZilla. We then used Dialog flow to make a test app for the google assistant which would respond to different commands given by the user and contact the closest car to request batteries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ESP8266 chip could not be integrated with our project, due to multiple file errors. We tried to use the Google Home Mini, but we were not able to connect the speaker to the google account, due to connection errors and were not able to configure the developer kit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to introduce a system which would increase the sales and use of electric vehicles.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Use batteries as slots. This would make batteries portable and replaceable. Hence, if a user gets stranded due to empty batteries, he/she can request for help and the nearest car, who is providing batteries. This extra battery might not be much, but it is enough for the user to go to the nearest charging station.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We used a model of 20:100, where every electric car has a 20% portable battery, and an original 100%. This portable battery can be easily dis-attached and can be exchanged to help another person in need. Basically, the person in need will exchange this used battery for a recharged one and can travel extra miles to the nearest charging station.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            For the user who has helped the one in need of a battery, the company can reward bonus points to the user's RFID card. These points can be claimed for cash back, or discounts while charging their own cars.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using Firebase, as we had never used it before. We also learned how to use Dialog flow to create a program for the google assistant. We were able to use the ESP8266 as a live tracker without having to use a GPS module.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Free Of Charge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The theory to help stranded users by exchanging batteries is both, practical and feasible. We strongly believe that this can become the next GrubHub, where batteries are exchanged. This can also lead to a new fleet of EV on the road, for example, EV's with their main car battery distributed in form of packs, when required.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Clean Transportation Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea is to share EV (Electrical Vehicle) batteries between consumers so that no car gets stranded on the road.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every EV will have an extra slot for portable battery. Whenever an EV has zero battery on its main battery and a portable battery, they can open the web and search for cars with spare batteries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To charge the spare battery it would cost $10 and 15 mins to charge on a supercharger, 
On the App, it would cost $15 ($10 to charge, $1 to the website and the rest to the nearby lending person) and no time to charge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is like Uber where you can book a charger and swap the empty charger with the full one.
