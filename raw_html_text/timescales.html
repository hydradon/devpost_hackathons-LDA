                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We liked the idea of building a measurement device that can scale to the time range we are interested in. If we're scientists looking at change in concentration of carbon monoxide, our outer ring might be a century. If we're analyzing blink rates and changes in ionic concentration as a person plays a video game, we're interested in looking from milliseconds to hours. Being able control subdivisions is also useful. Different cultures view time as cyclic and we thought that being able to let users decide how they want to break down their personal schedules and activities would be a useful tool to build.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses a hypocycloid as a large-scale clock and maps events onto the circle so that users can see their full schedule. Users can add their events to the the schedule and view them from year, week, or day views. The user can add a "free block" which creates an opportunity for the app to suggest meeting up with another person who is free in that time. The app also displays how the user spends their time so they can track and make lifestyle changes if wanted.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Figma to collaboratively create mockups and

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nesting hypocycloids was difficult. Deciding what kind of application and who our audience was also difficult. We weren't sure whether to market to corporations or just anybody. Also, thinking about how to share schedules and the degree of personal information that we work with was hard.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a mock-up that explains the interface well, and being able to simulate the main interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some trigonometry, how to use Figma, and how important it is to have a goal and a target audience to clarify what we want to build.
                </p>

                    What's next for TimeScales
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Be able to share calendars with people so that events show up on a single calendar and people can make sub-groups to share with others.
Take geographic location and make plots of large events that are available to the public so people can decide what to do.
