                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a struggle to transfer links from my computer to my phone quickly because iOS does not easily allow for Pushbullet to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It texts the current webpage to any given phone number.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built a Chrome extension that used Twilio's API and Chrome's API to send a text message of the current webpage a person was on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accessing the current tab of the page and getting the javascript files to work in a separate file because Chrome does not allow for inline scripting.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to properly integrate Twilio into my code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Copy as much given API documentation as possible.
                </p>
