                <p>
                    Every student has had a time when they felt backed up on work, and unable to effectively stay ahead. The tomato timer system addressed this problem, and enabled students to work smart. However, these tomato timer apps fail to address the specific tasks per student, or create an environment where the student feels prepared to study. With these changes and more, we're excited to

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app implements a timer system of 25 minutes of work, then 5 minutes of break. In addition, we also include calming music to focus the user during their 25 minutes of work. The GUI of our app allows for the user to have a pleasant and quirky experience when studying, and includes jokes to lower the stress.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided the production for Ketchup on Work evenly and efficiently. By having some only front or back end and also more flexible full stack developers, we addressed everyones issues as a team. The driving language behind our web app is javascript and Node.JS, and it also includes some of the Google Tasks API.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The incorporation of the API and edge cases with our timer presented difficulty. These ideas were central to our project, so we wanted to make them as powerful as possible. Any struggles with those aspects also hindered other parts of our program's creation. Getting over that stumbling block was frustrating, but such a rewarding experience.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our members had barely worked with javascript previously. Learning a new language from scratch is always a new exciting, and terrifying experience. This, combines with effective communication is part of our most proud moments as a team.

                    What's next for Ketchup on Work!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We look forward to including videos to help students make the most of their break time, such as animal livestreams or comedy. In addition, one of our future goals is to include animations with the featured ketchup bottle. The more we can make the web app fun to use, the better our user's experience can be. We can't wait to change the way student's study, and do the most to help our peers.
