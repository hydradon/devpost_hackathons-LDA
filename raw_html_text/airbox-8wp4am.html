                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meet the digital native generation - always online, on their phone, "on-the-go" as a life style. But often, the vital services like food delivery are still not supporting it. For example, when you receive a parcel from your favourite web shop you will need to be at home in order to get the delivery of your goods. Otherwise, neighbours have to take care of it. That's annoying! You will need to go and ask for the parcel, but also the post man might have to ring at multiple doors to find a temporary destination for your parcel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Provide a place to receive goods of any kind, let it be your latest online order, food from a local farmer or a cake baked by your grandma.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Step 1: Buy material from Bauhaus
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 2: Assembly box and connect electronics
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 3: Buy more material from Bauhaus
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 4: Solder parts together
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 5: Integrate Software
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Killed a battery, a relay and a micro-controller. (Maybe we should learn electronic logic better...)

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to open and close the box remotely
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a 12V solenoid with an Arduino-like micro-controller. Connect it to the cloud and learn to combine offline and online world.
