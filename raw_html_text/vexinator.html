                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The need for an easily made intelligent robot platform to take care of your house when gone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a live video feed with tilt and panning, tracks temperature and other environmental conditions. Avoids obstacles and reports 12 sensor values from an onboard Android Debice including GPS Location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a soldering iron, Arduino board, bluetooth module, motors, sensors, wires and a battery. It uses an onboard android phone to interface with arduino through bluetooth and communicate with firebase for real time control anywhere in the world.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not enough time to complete many features, difficulty learning new hardware compinents.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting firebase to successfully communicate with the arduino.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino Step motors, serial communication, and time management!
