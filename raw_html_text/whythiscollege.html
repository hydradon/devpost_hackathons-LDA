                    As high school seniors, one of the most daunting tasks is writing the essays for college applications. Almost every college these days makes you write an essay explaining why you want this specific university/ college/ department/ major/ etc. There are already many websites that give you advice on how to write that essay and they each say to research the school for the things that make them different and things they are proud of. No website helps you to do this, instead, you have to search for hours on the college website as well as other sources to find all the information about the college/department/major/etc. WhyThisCollege does the research for you.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    After entering the name of the university, WhyThisCollege gives you an abbreviated version of different things that make the university unique or things about which the university boasts. WhyThisCollege then offers information about the university's colleges/ schools/ departments. Sometimes the essay prompts you to explain why you want to go to a specific college within the university or a specific major. WhyThisCollege helps you with that as well in the same format as before giving an abbreviation of relevant information then linking to another website that gives more information. It doesn't do all the research for the student, but instead offers a good starting point for their research.
