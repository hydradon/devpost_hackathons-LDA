                <p>
                    The idea here will be to use a dataset of University Classes, and then present visualization for it. 
Given time, we will try to mock some test data, and present the users with suggestions based on their current semester and past courses. 
The backend system is assembled using a flask server that takes in a python file, then generates a json file which is then inserted into a database. The database is designed around a relational model connecting majors with courses using the python package SQLAlchemy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In future work, we hope to turn this into a suggestion engine for a student's classes they should take on a given semester.
