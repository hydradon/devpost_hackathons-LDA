                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was inspired by our fear for the unknown but our curiosity for local experiences.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before going on a trip, book a local from your desired destination. He will be able to assist you with packing, arrival, and the different activities that you plan on doing by giving you advices as to what you should be careful, what you should bring, what you should eat, the places you should go, etc. All this can be done either by SMS or by a real-life meet-up.
Every local has ratings, reviews and an area of interests, so that you can find the perfect Local for you!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are total beginners!! Upon arrival, one of teammates left us. We contact someone else, he came, and left us again. We waste the four first hours trying to figure out where to start. Then, we had to learn how to use Android Studio. Two of us left this morning, leaving only one person to finish up the app.
We couldn't work on back-end because it would take too much time and nothing concrete would come out of it. Instead, we worked on front-end to build a prototype of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud that we've been able to pull through this Hackathon. It was our first one, we didn't have any experience, we came out of it with a lot more knowledge and growing interest for app development. Even though we had a rough start, we still didn't give up and tried our best until the very end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely learned a lot about Android Studio, but most importantly we learned how to face a challenge, handle it and pull through it.
                </p>

                    What's next for Locals

                <p>
                    We hope to work on back-end data in hope of having a full functional app.
