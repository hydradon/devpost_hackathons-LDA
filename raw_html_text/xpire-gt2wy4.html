                    There is massive waste in the service industry when it comes to throwing away produce. Imagine finding that lettuce you knew you had and opening it to find a mushy brown mess? What if there was an alert system that told you when it would've started going bad? Would you have saved it? This is what led us to create Xpire, but on a large scale for the service industry. We created a website that acts as a database to organize and sort all the items by expiration date so businesses can plan ahead on what to use.

                    It is a database that users can easily add or delete an item with its quantity, description and expiration date. It also will track water usage with the user's water bill.

                    We hope for a widespread use of the app, including an app, and a way to scan items in the system. Hopefully, businesses could use the opportunity of using food before it goes bad or even donating it to food banks or homeless shelters.
