                        Captures images by the camera every second and analyzes it. The program looks for any distracting objects in the object as well as checks if the driver has their eyes open and is focused on the road. If the program detects any distraction, such as the driver looking elsewhere or the driver dosing off, it plays the siren sound. If the driver continues their behavior, the sirens multiply and get louder

                        We have multiple Python modules for detecting images, database, calculations for determining how closed the eyes are as well as a custom trained machine, who can identify genders based on the face alone. We used lots of Python modules, the whole list can be found below on the "Built with" section. For the web page, we used a combination of the flask library from Python along with JavaScript and HTML to power the application.
