                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When shopping in Krogers, considering the size and scale of the mart, it is often difficult and time consuming to locate and compare items. For example if I need to find zero sugar cereals or glutten free pasta, I have to go around and compare the items present in the shop. Life would have been a lot simpler, If there was a virtual assistant which can be accessed through web or messaging platforms without the need of installing any applications.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    As our team was having different expertise we built the web services required for web admin part and chatbots using Python Flask. The web admin module is powered by PHP and bootstrap. Chatbot was built with bot builder platform hellotars

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried hands on Messenger Bot Builder API for chatbots but failed to implement it considering time. Hence had to remove it at the last minute and use another offering.
