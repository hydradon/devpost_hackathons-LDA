                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A game that wasn't impossible to make and could be a real product to sell in the marketplace as well as a new twist/spin on a classic with a lot of room for new things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a Hotel Tycoon short demo game experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Practice and extensive knowledge of my toolset with Unity3D.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of proper sleep so that I wasn't able to focus to my best. I had a hard time making pretty code due to the time constraints so it's officially the ugliest code and data structure set I've ever written.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If not quickly, steadily moving forward constantly in my development. Never stopping when I sat down in my chair.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe plan my classes a little beforehand and always have a whiteboard ready. Visualization is an important part of my being able to properly see connections between connecting structures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hotel Tycoon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully one day reworking the ugly ugly code I wrote. Before that though, I would like to finish this product for sure and sell it on the market. I think now that the basics are down, the main thing will be getting art properly into the setting I currently have and doing the fine tweaks and turns to produce a very good Hotel Tycoon game.
