                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever wanted to know more about yourself and your friends' perception about you? This app came about with the notion that people gauge themselves based on other's perception and better themselves as a person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application allows users to anonymously answer various question about their friends in a question-feed style format. We also provide users with daily goals which, on completion, gives users access to graphs of other people's responses to questions about the user without knowing the identities of the responders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But...there is a catch!
In the event that a user and his/her friend answer the same question about each other, anonymity is thrown out of the window and both will be able to view the other's response to that question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is done to inculcate the sense of a barter system. In order to know which friend answered what about you, you must also answer questions about your friend.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application was built in Android Studio using Java, XML, JavaScript, Node.js, StdLib, MongoDB, Trello and AWS.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Following the MVP architectural pattern for the first time.
Intuitive UI/UX.
Providing users an incentive to return to the app.
