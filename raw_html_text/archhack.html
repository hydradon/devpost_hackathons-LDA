                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are not sure if we all will have someone around us all the time when we get very old, but we all need somebody who will be there for us when we need help.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An application that will always be there for you when you need help. When you need help, just a tab on the notification bar on your phone will request help for you from the nearest best-rated hospital and from your family doctor using the information you provided previously.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with zero experience about android studio and making android apps. We went by trial and error and spent a lot of time and effort on learning something new from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple concepts yet unfamiliar terms gave us big frustrations with errors here and there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have successfully made something out of nothing that we did not know anything about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that experience and practice is very important, but unity and friendship is even more important to be successful.
