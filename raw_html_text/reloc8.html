                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College graduates and young professionals often don't have a easy way to take into account how taxes, and their lifestyle's impact on the cost of living in a city. The standard calculation offered today only take into account of a standard index that does not take into account of behaviors. We want to take into account of how your personal habits will impact  your cost in a area.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used CSS and html to construct the front end, whiling using postgresQL for a database, along with python and Django to build out a backend API in order to perform the financial calculations based on user input. We also used a third party API, Taxee, for tax data.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    We ran into issues connecting to 3rd party API, and accurately developing the behavior indicators.
