                    The Comfort Connection is a profile database that alleviates the feeling of loneliness that often accompanies one&rsquo;s diagnosis with and treatment for many terminal or otherwise threatening diseases. By pairing afflicted users with others in the same position, The Comfort Connection provides a partner who understands and has experienced what the user has experienced. Not only that, but it is also able to pair Teachers with those willing to learn about a specific condition. These may be people that have loved ones who are afflicted that want to be able to understand what they are going through, or even just kind citizens who are curious about the struggles of others. In either situation, The Comfort Connection proves to be a powerful tool for not only connection but also education.
