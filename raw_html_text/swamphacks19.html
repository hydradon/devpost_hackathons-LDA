                    Both Travis and I grew up in northeast Florida. We have seen firsthand how many of our friends have been affected by inadequate access to food. Whether money or transportation, many people in this region go hungry far too often. That is why we wanted to work on a solution that could utilize resources already in place to distribute donated food at food banks and other organizations. These organizations might not have the resources to connect people in need to food that is available.

                    FOOZOO attempts to connect volunteer delivery drivers with organizations that have extra food. The delivery drivers can view requests from the food suppliers, and if they can carry out any of the requests, they have the option of accepting the delivery and picking up the food.

                    Over the past 30 hours, we have struggled against environment failures, bugs, and uncooperative frameworks to produce a very crude version of a project we hope to continue in the next few months. Though the main functionality is nowhere near a production-level application, we have a solid foundation for future iterations of development.
