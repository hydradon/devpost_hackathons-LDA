                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Headphones blasting sound into ears was fatiguing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Converts 2d seeming audio to 3d seeming audio. The audio is placed in 3d virtual space, so it seems like its coming from somewhere
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The audio wasn't the most realistic, and we wouldn't have been able to finish. SO we decided to work on this later.
