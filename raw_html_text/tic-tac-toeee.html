                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love challenging games and built this java app to defeat the user every time. Java as a programming language intrigues me and I love making games in it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simple tic tac toe that never allows the user to win and will result in a draw or a loss

                    Using java language
