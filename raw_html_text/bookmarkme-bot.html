                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Important messages get lost in GroupMe all the time. This is especially problematic for a class group chat, where a lot of important messages are sent but get lost in the constant barrage of messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BookmarkMe allows you to bookmark GroupMe messages for future reference. See a complete list of commands in the github repo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made a Flask API which interacts with the GroupMe API. I hosted it on Heroku to get a public URL. I have keywords/commands that trigger save, display and delete functionality. I store the bookmarks in a MongoDB instance.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        GroupMe API doesn't allow "continued conversations" so I had to cache the messages to the MongoDB.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        GroupMe API doesn't allow DMs with bots, so I had to rethink the design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Authentication with GroupMe is complicated
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    It works and is completely deployable right now. Try it out yourself - deploy it using the link in the Github repo, it literally takes like a minute. Also look at the video above.
