                </h2>
                <p>
                    reddit, youtube comments, debating, meme culture, internet outrage culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to make this app as a way of showing that disagreeing with someone on a topic doesn&rsquo;t have to be a bad thing.  In fact, for some people it can be a fun experience.  If you look at the countless comments and chains of replies on youtube, you will see that from disagreement emerges new and highly motivated communication patterns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have taken some of the two of the two largest phenomenons of the internet, meme culture and online debating, and have developed a game that can let the user get to know themselves and receive validation from their peers (re: their wit) in a fun competitive environment. Arguing for or against on topics they would not usually support.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apart from the obvious time limitations, we ran into technical difficulties with only one backed developer who had the sole task of implementing the backbone of our app.  It also took some time to gather the topics for debate, seeing as many were unsuitable, we had to be selective as to what our expected users would respond to.  In the end the app idea took on a life of it&rsquo;s own, part video game part image board and we were happy with the final product.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept and implementation over the weekend, despite not having a fully formed product, we have a working demo which can demonstrate some functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe we have made something that our niche audience will respond to, given that most young people read websites like reddit these days, they also play video games and are aware of a lot of the old game/movie characters that appear on our website. However playing online and being rated by peers gives a unique experience that can be both cathartic and exciting as you gather up those badges.
