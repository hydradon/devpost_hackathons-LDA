                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Health insurance is complicated, and that's on purpose. In fact, it took us over two hours just to pick apart what it is we needed to look at to build
                    <strong>
                        SimpleCare
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SimpleCare is a webpage where anyone can upload a Summary of Benefits and Coverage and get in return a synthesized chart of the most important aspects of their health insurance. SimpleCare can help people choose between insurance plans or just understand their existing insurance to begin with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Django for the front end and Python for the back end, creating a text analyzer that picks apart exactly what you need to know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult challenge we faced was connecting our front end to our back end. Unfortunately, something happened to our github, and the front end no longer works. Within the attached github is our still functioning back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the mission we've pursued. Everyone should be able to understand what they're buying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Django from scratch. We also learned how to work as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SimpleCare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SimpleCare has a long way to go, but it could one day be at the fingertips of every American.
