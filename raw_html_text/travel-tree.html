                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day while looking for somewhere to study abroad, I became overwhelmed with the number of programs and options available. Here, we seek to minimize the emotional struggle of choosing somewhere using Alexa.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa will ask a series of questions and then
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Wanted to incorporate regex, elasticsearch or DynamoDB but did not due to time constraints and limited manpower
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Created an idea and collaborated with other inspired students to make a simple but nonetheless functional project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    how to use regex and AWS. Will definitely use both in the future
