                <p>
                    I was inspired to create this after I spent long amount of time sitting down doing work but when I got time to do exercise I didn't know what to do or when I did it seemed dull and mundane to do the exercise. I had a Echo Dot in my office. Thats when I had a

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a rather simple concept. It uses a Array of exercises and then when the user invokes  the skill it starts the maths randomiser which then picks a exercise and then outputs it to the user via voice and/or the screen on their screened devices.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with ASK documentation , My Own Skills , Stack Overflow and the Alexa Developers Forum (and my Son!)

                <p>
