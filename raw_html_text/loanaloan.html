                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed to loan some friends money, very often
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meant to keep track of loans between a circle of friends
It was more of a learning experience creating a functioning web app and connecting all the different parts.
