                    Akira (あきら), which means "intelligence" in Japanese, is a respectful Personal Assistant. It is completely safe for your privacy and unlike its competitors, it will not send data to be mined in the inter-webs.

                <p>
                    It is able to help you with your social media, with integration into Twitter and Facebook. Even if you aren't social media savvy, Akira's encrypted and open-source text-messenger, would allow you to send texts to anyone, just by a simple phrase.

                    When going out, Akira can recommend you on the weather and what to wear by asking: "Akira, what's the weather like today?". Even at home, when you want to just talk about yourself and perhaps journal it, we have a fully custom coded journal library, which was created during the hackathon (

                    ) that can take care of that for you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a fun extra, we added a general challenge bot, in which you will be randomly assigned a compiled list of fun challenges to have some fun!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built it using Python and its library. Furthermore, some libraries were custom coded with custom endpoints/api calls.

                <p>
                    Speech to text was a major challenge, because it was very slow and because it was very inaccurate. We ultimately were able to find a more reliable and persistent library in ProjectSphinx.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments:
1) A custom coded library that is on the official package manager
2) Text to speech and speech to text ended up working.
3) Social Media worked really well.
4) Cross-platform
