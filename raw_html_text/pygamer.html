                    quick, modular, maintainable, and scalable. You can load a game window in a matter of seconds, build a simple game in a matter of minutes, and then spend as much time as you want to scale your game as far as you like. And it will be easily maintainable, debuggable, and variable. This is due to the central ideas behind the Pygamer system for Pygame.

                        Menus should not affect gameplay until active, at which point they should immediately take over the game loop

                        The current running Game or Menu should receive and delegate all events to the proper handlers
