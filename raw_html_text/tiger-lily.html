                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got inspired by the multiple incidents at UNC Charlotte. Some students were robbed at gun point in the middle of the night. Moreover, a lot of students study late at night in the library before walking to their dorm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole idea was based on having Tiger Lily be a small keychain with two buttons. One button would was supposed send out a signal to alert the police and anyone linked to the app and send your location using GPS. We were also planning on using Microsoft Azure Facial Recognition to send out a detailed list of an attacker's features. However, right now, we used Balsamiq to make a prototype of what the Tiger Lily app would look like.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried using the DragonBoard 410c along with the Arduino Sensor Mezzanine to attach the two buttons.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting to the internet with the DragonBoard because it required using Linux which we're not familiar with. We tried to switch to Arduino but it didn't have a GPS component nor was it being detected on our laptops.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How detailed we made the design, and also well we applied it to everyday. Moreover, its a safety device that not only girls can use, but everyone, and giver parents a piece of mind.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Azure Facial Recognition and more about Microsoft API.

                    What's next for Tiger Lily
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a smaller board and implementing the design.
