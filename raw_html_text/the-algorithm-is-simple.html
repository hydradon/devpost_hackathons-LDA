                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the website
                    <a href="http://www.theproofistrivial.com" rel="nofollow">
                        www.theproofistrivial.com
                    </a>
                    . The proof is trivial mocks the way some mathematicians and math majors behave when explaining proofs. Sometimes when a mathematician is talking about how to do a proof, they will say something along the lines of "oh the proof is trivial," then proceed to use advanced math terms that don't really explain how to do the problem. The proof is trivial mocks this by explaining how to do any proof with the simple template 'The proof is trivial! Just view the problem as a [random math term] whose element are [random math term]. We felt that computer scientists are just as bad when it comes to explaining algorithms in a condescending manner, thus there also needs to be a 'The Algorithm is Simple' website.

                <p>
                    Our website does something very similar to 'The Proof is Trivial', except our template is 'The algorithm is simple! Just reduce it to the [random np-complete problem] problem then implement it with [random algorithm/data structure/computer science term]'

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we collected computer science terms and buzzwords from wikipedia and elsewhere on the internet.
We wanted the website to have the same look and feel as 'The proof is trivial', so we used the client side html and javascript from theproofistrivial as a template for our website. We are hosting the website with github pages.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We wanted to have our own domain name, however it was difficult to create a CNAME record with Domain.com.

                    I'm proud of building my first website.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a little about html and javascript (I have never used these languages before).

                <h2>
                    What's next for The Algorithm is Simple
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are thinking that after The Algorithm is Simple 'explains' how to implement the algorithm, it provides a link to a stack overflow page with 'relevant' code.
