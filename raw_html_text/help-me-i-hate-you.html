                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Keyword in the game jam was "resurrection". This was originally a prototype but turned into a short  "finished" game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A co-op shooter where you resurrect your allies who help you defeat enemies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with all kinds of features and tested them in Construct 2. In the end we made one game in Unity called Curepitsa and this one in Construct.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard to make polished work in such a short time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone got to do things they wanted and whole team could discuss together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game Jamming is more about realizing what ideas are good and less about creating a lot of content in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Help Me I Hate You
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few updates to fix bugs. It'll stay in Scirra Arcade where people can play it.
