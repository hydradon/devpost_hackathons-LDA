                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being cheap students, we didn't want to pay for a MIDI keyboard and decided we could make our own!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Keyboard can be accessed online from your phone, tablet or other personal devices. These keyboards range from QWERTY to MIDI boards. Once connected to a PC, they can be used right away.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The keyboards were created with CSS, HTML and JavaScript. The server that communicates between the peripheral and the computer uses Node JS. A Python script was used to invoke the key commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire project and most of the technologies used were very new to all of us. We came to this hackathon with a fleshed out idea about a projected keyboard. One of our crucial hardware parts didn't work out as expected and we were forced to abandon the plan. We still managed to create a similar application that achieved our original goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to build a solid product from gaining knowledge of unknown technologies to completion all in 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even with meticulous plans, unexpected fallbacks may occur. Despite the inconveniences and roadblocks, keeping a positive attitude and open mind can keep the team moving forward.
