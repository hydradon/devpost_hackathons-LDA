                    Inspiration
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was children with Cerebal Palsy who need a fun and engaging way of improving their motor skills.

                    Gameplay
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea behind the game was to have a star wars themed game that could be controlled using the myo.  Due to the lack of assets we settled for a different style but still being aimed at children.

                    How we built it
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made the game in unity and got our assets from the unity asset store.

                    Challenges
                </p>
                <p>
                    We struggled with version control through Github because we were all working on different versions of the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </p>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to use Github in a large group without too many problems.  Prototype which is functional enough to be able to show what the aim of the project was.

                    What we learned
                </p>
                <p>
                    How to use Unity and Github as we had little experience using either.  Commands on the command line and git bash in order to effectively control git
                </p>

                    What's next for Coordi
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to collect information on the movement of the wearer such as response time, time between one hit and the next.  We also want to be able to calculate how much the user strayed from the perfect arc.
