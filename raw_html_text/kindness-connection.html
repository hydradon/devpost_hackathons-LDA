                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was not only the good feeling one gets from helping someone out, but that it gives people connections. We wanted to be able to showcase these connections visually through a map of deeds being paid forward throughout the world.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can can create a Kind Connection account, find a good deed to do, do it, and record their deed and location. This location is mapped so that all other users can see good deeds scattered around the world. This is in the hope that we can seed the world with more kindness.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our website with a combination of html, css, and javascript.
Our database is built with sql and is connected to our website through php.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon, so we didn't really know how to plan as well. We didn't realize until a ways into this project that it would require many languages that we didn't know. We did not know javascript, html, css, or php. This hindered our progress and connection of different components. However, we coded on and though we don't have a complete product, it's a good idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new languages overnight and trying something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planning is key and research into what your project needs ahead of time so we can see if it is plausible. Our project was more than we could handle in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kind Connection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting our database to our website. Improving the UI. Changing deeds to connections of deeds through Facebook. The idea is that you can invite a friend to participate and if they do, they will be connected to your good deed trail. They can see all the locations that eventually trailed to them and when they invite a friend, see where their trail goes. This is not only to encourage kindness, but to see how far it can go in the world.
