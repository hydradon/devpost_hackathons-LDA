                    So Valentine's day hurts us a lot. Being single is hard, especially you have to eat alone sometimes. So Never Eat Alone comes so that nobody will eat alone. This platform helps you find your friends who are also planning to go to the dining halls at the same time periods you are. This way Never Eat Alone saves you the hassle of asking your friends one by one and see who is free to grab a quick meal.

                    You pick and choose your dining hall and time preferences, and then it connects you with other friends who are also down for the same

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    The platform we decided was a website, therefore we used mostly tools for web-development such as css, html, bootstrap. The most interesting we used today is that we learned how to implement Firebase to manage our user accounts.
