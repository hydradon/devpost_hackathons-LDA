                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Excessive pressure and long-last depression could result in serious mental problems among students, proven by students&rsquo; committing suicide every year. What&rsquo;s worse, mental problems are usually hidden, meaning that they are not easy to expose, either due to a lack of public concern or the person&rsquo;s unwillingness. To alleviate mental health problems, we targeted university students and developed Bloomood, an application including both Web and mobile sites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bloomood is based on four main features: A Mental Health Test, online available psychologists, events on campus relating to mental health, and a progress tracker. First, Bloomood provides mental health assessments to give an idea of a student&rsquo;s current mental health levels and areas of concern. This test will be written in collaboration with psychologists in order to obtain reliable results. 
Different from existing apps, our application focuses on relieving mental problems through an interactive way rather than giving excessive information on mental illnesses or hotlines. Stored in an underlying database, the results of the test are monitored by campus psychologists so that potential problems can be detected at an early stage. 
Additionally, we show a list of upcoming campus events relating to mental health, such as therapy dogs or yoga classes, based on user profile and testing results. Another salient feature of Bloomood is that users can write diaries and record their moods every day, and we render them a chance of retrospect showing how their mental states develop over a long time.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Zoho Creator to generate the boilerplate of the web application, and we used Adobe Xd for mobile app development, including the UX/UI wireframes and prototypes. We then attach various features to the skeletons.

                    <li>
                        As beginners, we have difficulties in choosing the most suitable development toolkits. We did plenty of research to find out the helpful tools which allows us to accomplish a feasible and meaningful project within a short time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since not every one of us is familiar with source version control systems, we encountered problems in collaborating. The toolkit we selected ended up providing us shared environement for collaboration.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to cooperate with teammates to promote productivity. One fact we recognized is that advanced tools do not necessarily lead to effective solutions. As a result, we should always well understand the design goal, thus choosing the most suitable development toolkits. Meanwhile, we learned the importance of clarifying problems at an early stage during the UI/UX workshop, and applied the design strategy to our project.
