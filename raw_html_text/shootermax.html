                <p>
                    This game is so addictive. You feel love in playing this game. I personally liked this game.
There are many features in this game like;
-- There are two modes in this Game one is Endless-mode and the second mode is Level-Mode.
                    <strong>
                        Endless Mode
                    </strong>
                    --In this mode player have to hit the plates that come from the left side,There is a ball counting function in this mode.If you don't hit the plate, three balls will be deducted from total balls available.If you hit the ball then there is bonus of three balls.If you lose all the balls, you will the game.
                    <strong>
                        Level Mode
                    </strong>
                    --In this mode, There is a level system.if you complete levels then it will unlock more levels.There are total of 80 levels in this mode that I added.As in the endless mode , There is no ball counting system,In this mode you have unlimited balls.The concept of level mode is that there are hearts.If you skip one plate you will lose one heart.
                    <strong>
