                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've loved the concept of VR and especially of using VR for Space Themed games. This is my first step into the amazing world of VR and it certainly will not be my last.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You are in the cockpit of the ship and can look around the ship and press buttons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the models in Blender, I assembled the component parts in Unity and I configured it to work with VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the Oculus rift was really hard. I had a teamate who spent hours last night trying to get the oculus to work with his computer. He quit, but I kept working on the unity project and the models. In addition, I ran into several problems with Unity. One was the raycasting. The FPSController in Unity has two transformations in the game objects. I was using the wrong one and so the ray I was sending out was the incorrect one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I actually managed to get a program working in VR. I also managed to show to myself my ability to solve problems when I stick to it, ask others for help, and work hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity, Oculus, and Blender. My knowledge of them was sketchy prior to this hackathon. Now I have greater confidence that I will be able to create more games in the future with Unity and Blender. I also learned a lot about the Oculus rift and about how marvelous a piece of technology it is. VR has filled me with a sense of wonder and awe.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ironing out the rest of the bugs with the VR version. Filling the game out with more interactive elements.
