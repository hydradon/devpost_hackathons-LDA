                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the past two years with transitioning to university, we have found it to be difficult to maintain friendships. As someone studying business, I understand the importance of CRM and wondered whether or not the same concepts, ideas, and structure could be applied to managing and facilitating my friendships.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack aims to help the user maintain relationships and friendships through reminders to communicate. By analyzing your current messaging patterns through Facebook Messenger our app would decide a time frame, say every 15 days, that you should reach out to a specific friend.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was both of our first hackathons so while we did not create a fully fledged mobile app, I developed the design and layout using Figma (a UX designer tool) and Nancy implemented a messaging web application using node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never done mobile design before and while we started by aiming to make an Android app, the transition from design to Android Studios was much more difficult than we expected.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created the layout for a mobile app using a site I discovered at HTN. Nancy made a functioning messenger application and learned a large amount of the backend development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Let's Connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to work with the Facebook API and Machine Learning to get the computer to predict the arc or pathway of relationships and adjust your communication reminders to help facilitate this. Additionally, we could incorporate multiple social media platforms and aggregate interactions to give a deeper understanding of a person's  relationships. Finally, we would like to add more features to manage relationships. These would be things like suggestions for meetup locations and events or notifications when a friend you have not seen in a long time is in your city, thereby moving the focus from just reaching out on social media to spending time in person.
