                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we first entered the Hackathon, we set out to find an agricultural problem we could attempt to solve. While the challenges provided a few common and large-scale problems, we discovered an unsung one: farmers in the United States have always been under the control of "distributers," who are just middle men contributing nothing essential to the process. Our team has embarked on a mission to create a way for farmers to be freed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a marketplace for farmers to input what crops they are selling and a few descriptors (quantity, price, GMO/non-GMO, and a short description) and buyers to input what they are looking to buy. We then created a ranking algorithm to match farmers to buyers based on these factors, and then users are able to connect with and message potential partners. The last step was to use a machine learning algorithm to create a recommendation process for buyers based off of historical data of crop prices vs temperature, rainfall, and weather.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the UI on Android Studio and coded the backend on Java, which was simple to integrate together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several technical aspects of designing the UI gave us difficulty, but we were able to solve each challenge with enough time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of making an entire app in 24 hours, and specifically being able to create and integrate smart ranking and recommendation algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned valuable skills integrating coding in teams (this is our first Hackathon!) and being able to plan out a short-term project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Farma
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to take our recommendation and ranking algorithms a bit further by involving more variables and improving accuracy, because those are the most interesting aspects of Farma.
