                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Step 1: Built a PCB and LED matrix, based off the Max7219 and an Arduino Pro-Mini (AtMega328) as the micro-controller
Step 2: Realized the PCB was flawed and waited until the day before HackBU for the fixed board to arrive
Step 3: Hand assemble 38 separate electrical components, most of which were surface-mount, at 7 in the morning
Step 4: Spent a 24-hour hackathon writing drivers for the board, and repeatedly testing, until the blue lights shined true!

                    Challenges I ran into

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The coordinate system ended up having an origin in the top right-hand corner of the display
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designing code to only use 6 of the 8 bits in each of the Max7219's registers, lead to unused data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developing letters that are readable in a 3x5 pixel resolution (A-Z, 0-9, etc. converted into 3-Byte sets)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a snake-game algorithm that fir the hardware scheme I had designed

                    <li>
                        Successfully used a coordinate system with an origin in the top right-hand corner of the display
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Designed code to only use 6 of the 8 bits in each of the Max7219's registers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Developed letters that are readable in a 3x5 pixel resolution
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a snake algorithm that uses the Arduino-based LED-driver hardware, which I designed

                    <li>
                        Arduino IDE is still in need of some major improvements and development
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hackathons are fun, and a great place to get things done
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Code can compensate for inefficient design work, but should not be used as an excuse to finish a PCB design project early, or with unqualified results
                    </li>
                    <li>
