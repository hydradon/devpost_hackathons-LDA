                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a game that would allow us to utilize Unity's physics engine and enable to player to have the challenge of building something within a shooter style game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this game you start as a spaceship with a gun fighting enemy ships. As you defeat the enemy ships you can collect their leftover sub-components, which for this prototype means collecting additional gun turrets, if you don't damage them while fighting the enemy ships. Then you can attach them to your own ship in various configurations allowing you to take on stronger enemies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and wrote the game primarily through scripts in C#. We shared code through Github and separate different elements of the game into subtasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We underestimated how difficult it would be to learn Unity's API and as such it was hard to create functional code from the start. The rather steep learning curve and the short time to work made all equally contributing difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a playable game that has a fairly unique concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about how to write, and not write, code in Unity and C#. It was a refresher for some members of our group in C# and C# was entirely new to some of out group. While we didn't all accomplish the same amount of visible results, we all learned a lot about how this game works under the hood.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Space Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Attending different schools will make collaborating on this in the future logistically difficult. However, it will be fun to continue developing this game in our spare time and collaborating on possible future features. We would like to include different options for future components such as engines and gun upgrades. We would also like to add environment challenges like black holes to keep the game play interesting.
