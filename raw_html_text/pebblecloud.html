                    The project intends to allow users to store a message to the cloud based on their current coordinates, while others can read the messages only if they are exactly at the same spot. This could be used in games like scavenger hunt, where messages are the clue to the next place, or in travelling, where people can leave their thoughts and reviews for later travelers to better enjoy the place, or many other fields.
