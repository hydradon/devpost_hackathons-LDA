                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's so much violence and hate in this world, and it's really stressing everybody out. Also, it's only a matter of time before the zombie apocalypse, and that's pretty stressful too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kyle can be whatever you want him to be--a cute stuffed animal, or a keyboard emulating controller for computer games, or just a friend to talk to to help debug faulty code. The game itself is a maze that you navigate while trying to kill zombies, gaining points for the longer you survive and the more zombies you kill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Makey-Makey, a keyboard emulator, to map buttons on Kyle to different keys on the keyboard. We also designed a first-person shooter game in Java specifically to be played using Kyle as a controller. The 3D graphics also implement raycasting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    --Designing a pathfinding algorithm for the zombies in our game.
--Adding graphics to the game (giving the walls textures).
--Preserving the appearance of Kyle while disemboweling and re-emboweling him several times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    --Managing to design, create, and submit an entry with a team of first-time hackers without mentors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    --How to add raycasting to make a game 3D.
--Playing computer games is more fun using a controller than a keyboard.
                </p>

                    What's next for Stress Penguin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    --Make the game run faster.
--Make the game more complex.
--Improved graphics
