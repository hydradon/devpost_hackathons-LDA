                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by our desire to educate people on the damage humans have caused to the earth, we wanted to combine our technical skills and desire to create a website that educates people on sustainability issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The site educates people on air quality, directs them to proper resources, and visualizes carbon monoxide emmissions around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Node.js and Express for the website, and the map was made with Leaflet and Leaflet-Heatmap.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting data from API's, and setting up the math with its limited documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In less than 24 hours, we were about to create a functional website that visualizes data in intuitive ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about how to use API's as well as UI skills, and teamwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SaveAir
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SaveAir can still use more data and more visuals on the map. We plan to add more parameters of air emissions.
