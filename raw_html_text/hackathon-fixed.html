                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eager to begin coding, I opened the Princeton Hackathon's website, and soon found myself wasting several minutes trying to find details regarding the event. There was no information about when workshops were being held, when meals were, where submissions went, etc... It was then that a friend told me to go to hackprinceton.com/
                    <strong>
                        guide
                    </strong>
                    and hackprinceton.com/
                    <strong>
                        dayof
                    </strong>
                    for this
                    <strong>
                        critical
                    </strong>
                    information. Therefore, I vowed that one day others would be spared this pain. Thus, I created a chrome extension that adds the _ dayof _ and _ guide _ links to the hackprinceton website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That's right! The Hack Princeton website is allowed to reach its full potential with _ dayof _ and _ guide _ links using this nifty extension.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I googled "how to make a google chrome extension" and followed the results I found. Stackoverflow was a godsend, and I couldn't have done this project without it. I created the necessary manifest.json file along with the interacting javascript and html files to accomplish this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Hack Princeton website is now complete thanks to this invention.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to make chrome extensions.

                    What's next for Hackathon [Fixed]
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've considered just recommending that next year's staff includes such vital information on the homepage/toolbar without making students type new urls in.
