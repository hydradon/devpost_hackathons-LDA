                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from the interfaces and GUIs of certain video games, and the "mini-maps" that they use to display information with players. Our app uses this idea and applies it to the real world: allowing pedestrians and travellers to select points of interest in their area and easily navigate to them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MiniMapp begins by presenting users with a simple circular map of their immediate area. From there, they can use a search bar to find locations in their area using natural language processing queries to select points of interests and add them to their map by selecting an icon to represent their destination. These places appear on the edge of the map and rotate with the user as they change their direction, so they can always find their way around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Intially, searching maps databases was a bit of a challenge, but we were able to overcome this and incorporate it into the core of our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud our orientation based mapping system and how it enables users to easily find their way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I gained a lot more iOS experience; in the past I have focused on other platforms, but this time we experiences a good success in developing on iOS again, and we am excited to continue working on this in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MiniMapp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MiniMapp's core functionality has already been developed, but in the future we envision more ways to explore places around you in greater detail with more information, and better capabilities for saving the locations that you have visited.
