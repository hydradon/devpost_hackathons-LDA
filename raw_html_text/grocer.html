                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Usually when I go to a supermarket, I spend a lot of time thinking about what I need to buy. I'd have loved to have an app that would tell me what to buy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply, it tells you what to buy (for 1 day or 3 or X days), what you can cook from it, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walmart API + IBM Watson (for recipes) + Kinetise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kinetise is not too flexible. Walmart APIs are poorly documented and sometimes fail.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prototyping mobile apps with Kinetise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Grocer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    World domination, of course. Or, Walmart should roll it out in all their stores.
