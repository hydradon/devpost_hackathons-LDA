                    Memento is an all in one IoT application that provides therapy and care for dementia patients.  It runs on two separate platforms that communicate their data with each other.  The first part of our solution is a mobile Android Application.  In this application, the user can enter Admin mode and create their settings for voice control and right and wrong answers.  Then the user or their family members can create stimuli that will then be used in their game.  The game then will show the user pictures of people, places, or memories, and ask them what the picture is of.  The user can then use voice commands to tell the application what is in that picture.  If the user gets the answer right, he scores a point and continue playing the game.  This data is then sent to the second part of this solution.  But, there is an additional part of the mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Location Services for Tracking the Patient
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One important concern for dementia patients is that they begin to wander and don't remember where they were going or how they got there, and most importantly, they don't remember how to get home.  So in our mobile application, we have incorporated location services that keep track of the user in real time.  The user can go and check how far he has strayed from home by simply pressing a single button, and this will send data to our web application as well.  In addition, with the integration of the Uber API, the user can simply press a single button to call for an uber to bring them home using the location they are currently at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Web Application
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The second portion of this hack, is the web application hosted by Microsoft Azure.  The web application allows the user to log into their dashboard and access information about themselves in the case that they begin to forget things from their history.  We focused on the personal aspect of this mental illness, such that the patient could trigger their memories or answer the questions the ask over and over again by viewing this web page.  So, once they log in, they will have access to the most basic of information which includes their name, birthday, phone number, address, and a link to 911 in case of an emergency.  They will see links to "Family", "Friends", "Memories", or "Home" with corresponding pictures.  If the user clicks on the
                    <strong>
                        Family
                    </strong>
                    or
                    <strong>
                        Friends
                    </strong>
                    tab, they will be brought to their contacts page, where they have access to a database of family and friends' contact information along with corresponding pictures of the contact.  This page shows the contact's picture, their relation to the user, their phone number, address, and email.  This way, the user can contact them however they'd like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the user were to click on the
                    <strong>
                        Home
                    </strong>
                    button, they would be brought to a map page.  Using the Google Maps API, we integrated a map that provides them with interactive access to past events in their life as well as their current location.  They can scan over the map to see where they were born and on what date.  Other examples of events that could potentially go on the map include the date of marriage or when their first child was born.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the user were to click on the
                    <strong>
                        Charts
                    </strong>
                    tab, they would be brought to a page full of data visualizations for various things regarding Dementia in general as well as their own personal data.  The first graph they would see is how well they are performing in the mobile application on a day to day basis.  Then, they'd have access to a pie chart providing awareness on the most common forms of Dementia, and lastly, they could see how much time they are spending within their home by gathering data from the location tracking aspect of the mobile application.  This data can be used to see how long they have wandered for to see how far away they might have gone, or track daily habits on how much time they typically spend in their homes on a day to day basis.  These data visualizations were made using Morris and Flot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, if the user were to click on the
                    <strong>
                        Memories
                    </strong>
                    tab, they would be brought to an interactive time line that is easily customizable.  They can add new events or delete old ones.  This time line will show them the date, time, place, information, and a picture of the event taking place at the current time.  And the user can swipe through events to recall what he or she has done throughout their life as well as view pictures of the event.  This is really important to the user because this will provide them answers to a lot of questions, such as who was at which event and what exactly took place or when the event took place and what the importance was.  It provides the user not only with information about the date, but with information on when it happened and pictures for further memory recollection.

                <h2>
                    Purpose
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As some of our team member have witness how hard it is for Dementia patients first hand, we thought this series of applications would come in great use not only for the patient themselves, but for their families and care takers.  We put everything a patient would need in one easy to access place.  They can view their memories, call for an Uber if they get lost, play memory games and track their progress, they have access to a database of contacts, and they have location services so their caretaker can see how far from home they are.
