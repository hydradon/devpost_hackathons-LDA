                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every new quarter comes with the same problem--navigating the various school websites in search of office hours times and locations, professor emails and phone numbers. We wanted to make it simpler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill allows your Amazon Echo&trade; device to access your college websites for nearly instant access to any piece of information about faculty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Started with a javascript webscraper, then proceeded to integrate into an AWS lambda function that is triggered by an Alexa skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Navigating an overwhelming amount of guides, articles, blog posts, tutorials, documentation on how to develop an Alexa skill and choosing a path to take.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got it working. Hopefully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't get stuck on dead end approaches. Learn to move on and try alternative paths.
                </p>
