                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Me and a friend were sitting drinking coffee after hearing about the diffuse Berlin hackathon. Discussing some far-fetched and sci-fi-esk ideas we eventually tuned into a great idea. GoodDB! Our idea is to provide databases to developers that do good to the world, much like fair-trade databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Progress
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never learned about distributed and P2P networks before, but after reading the IPFS whitepaper and the orbitdb github repo i'm actually very interested in the subject! I'm currently working out the technical side of how to manage P2P databases and gather metrics about them.

                <h2>
                    Goal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to come to diffuse with a great plan of action and a basic program as a proof of concept with a hope that we can gain some interest in our project.
