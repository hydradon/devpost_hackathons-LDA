                    Think back to where you watched fireworks on the 4th of July. The only thing brighter than the explosions in the sky was the sea of handheld computers that the onlookers held in front of their face to record a video with bad audio to send to friends. Think about that person you knew from back home who thinks Olive Garden is a fancy restaurant who posts 1000 pics of their newborn every day. Once again, a handheld computer is standing in the way of a personal experience just so the photos can be shared online. 
We intend to liberate our fellow humans from the barriers of the handheld computer that sends pictures to their friends by introducing a device that immerses the person in their own experience while allowing them to share an equally immersive video through virtual reality.

                <p>
                    The transition to immersive computing is becoming apparent as consumer interest in VR has rapidly increased in the last 3 years. We designed Virtualix, literally a pair of virtual eyes, in order to give people a way to connect with one another to ensure that virtual reality is a personal and unifying experience.
