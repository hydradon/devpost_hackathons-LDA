                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started brainstorming for around an hour and one of us got the idea of encrypted chats for cybersecurity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Impart allows the user to send encrypted messages to another user making the message more secure and less vulnerable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java, Android Studio, XML, Firebase
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into was getting the encryption working on the app. Another challenge was writing down all of the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to make an app that allows messaging without anyone being able to spy or see it easily. We are also proud of being able to write such a large amount of code in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never use Android Studio again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Impart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on developing this app even more in the future to make conversations even more secure.
