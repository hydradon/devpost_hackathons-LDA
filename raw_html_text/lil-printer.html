                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One day, one of our team members was desperately running around campus looking for working printers. After visiting three printers, she finally stumbled upon a working printer. Not even two hours later, she met her friend who was also searching desperately for a working printer. That's when she realized how great it would be to have a printer application that indicated which printers are actually working!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application tracks all the printers on campus and updates their status of working or not working based on student updates. Students can only update the application if they have an email that ends in @gatech.edu, and those with administrative privileges can add new printers and delete old printers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using Android Studio, firebase, the Google Maps API, and many sleepless nights filled with tears and food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it was our first time actually hacking at a hackathon, we had a hard time planning out our application and executing it in general. None of us previously had experience with firebase, and generally, we struggled with executing our plans for the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how we made a working application and how we were able to accomplish most of the plans we had for the application. Most importantly, we are proud of our teamwork and our ability to communicate with one another!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the importance of SCRUM meetings and the importance of communicating even if it's six in the morning, and we are all running on less than three hours of sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lil' Printer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can improve upon our application and make it into something Georgia Tech can use to improve the lives of students. (so we can stop running around on campus in search of working printers...)
