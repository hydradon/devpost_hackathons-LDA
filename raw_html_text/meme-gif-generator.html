                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make something simple so I'd be able to complete it within the 24 hour time limit. For my first Hackathon I saw it not only as a fun competition but a chance to find the motivation to learn android development. I thought people would enjoy seeing memes and gifs using a simple app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It generates a random gif or meme with a push of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build it in Java using Android Studio and XML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was following  tutorials try to assemble the different pieces but got completely stuck trying to link the button to any action. This led me to scrapping my project entirely 4 times, although the last 3 times were within a 30 minute time frame while the first was 7 hours in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though I struggled to find an idea in the beginning I was adamant about still trying to find one and complete it fully by the end. I acknowledged when it was time to start over and used my time effectively after my struggles in the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to link actions with button presses in Android Studio using a setOnClickListener and learned that savedInstance saves the application state like inputs when the app is out of memory. I also learned that Android Studio uses an Asset Mangaer to manage app icons which you will need to chose between 4 types of mip maps depending on your target device's screen resolution.
