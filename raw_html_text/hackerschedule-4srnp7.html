                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration we have for our project stems from our struggles in managing our time as we work on our assignments. In order to counter that, we decided to create something that will allow us to see our tasks throughout the day in order to track our tasks over time. Hence the Hack Your Schedule project was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a webpage that allows us to input our tasks that we do over time. What's cool about it is that it allows the user to be a better planner as you become aware of what we've done over a specific day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using node express, react, and mongo database in the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the challenges we ran into is that most of our members were relatively new to these programming languages. We spent some time in the first and second days attending workshops in order to learn how to apply these languages into our project. Another challenge we ran into is that one of our backend developers was unable to use his laptop after it crashed in a windows update. We were able to secure a second device in time and was able to continue with our project in the end.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplishment we are proud of is that we managed to create a very welcoming and open environment for each other to learn and grow. Through this, we were able to create a front end page and design by the end of the first day of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the end, we learned how to work together with our team, and being able to attend workshops together allowed everyone to catch up to certain skills we ended up using for the project.
                </p>

                    What's next for hack-your-schedule
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our plans after this submission is to move this project to react native in desktop and mobile in order to make it more universally applicable. We hope to reach out to more users with this in mind in order to allow any other user that comes after us to have the options to manage their time more effectively.
