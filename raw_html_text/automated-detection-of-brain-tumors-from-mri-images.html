                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Computing is a powerful tool that is currently underused in the medical field today. One of the members on our team, Jenny, is in the Neuroscience Lab at TJ. She wanted to be a doctor growing up, but found a passion for programming in high school. However, she now wants to apply computer science to biology research to find non-invasive methods for diagnoses and treatments of diseases, including cancer.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Web application takes a set of DICOM files of horizontal brain slices captured by an MRI and runs a Mathematica function through it. Using the Mathematica function, the tumor is detected using a series of image processing techniques that are able to distinguish cancerous masses by applying distinct morphological, eccentricity, and contrast features typically presented by tumors in MRIs.

                    Wolfram Alpha is powerful, but it is not a very mobile language.
