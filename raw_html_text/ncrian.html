                <h2>
                    Inspiration: Since NCR offers banking, retails, grocery, resturants and many other information technology solutions, I decided to taking the advantage of its large influnce to build NCR ecosystem that makes all clients and users linked and connected.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: A feature allows NCR clients and users to make transactions online basing on the clients' product and service provided with users' need where also a client can be a user to other client. A another feature for business owners, they would be able to see the analytic reports and take reaction, and they can catch the peak serving time when it's busy to maximize labor utilization or reduce labor cost when it's slow.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: Login, signup, retrieve by email, client can post promotion and coupon, client can check events near by and weather, client and user can make purchases, step by step move from front-end to back-end, also tried Web NFC, but failed
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: It is my first time writing code in python and flask web framework, I was basically coding while learning.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of I finished the project all alone. It is my fourth time participate GSU hackthon, yet it is the first time to complete one.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned is the coding spirit that one shall not give up trying because of one field or programming language he or she is not familiar with.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NCRian: The first I would do is to make it more robust for exception handling and less hard-coded for optimization. Since it is such a short period of time, and I was working on my own. Second, I would make the analytic report with visualization tool not just in table or list. Third, I would like to deploy on cloud infrastructure. Last, I want to talk with industry professionals about my idea, and learn from them.
