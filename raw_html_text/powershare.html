                <p>
                    PowerShare allows a user to earn money throughout the day with your EV, wherever your car is. You can quickly find other vehicles/devices that need a charge and are willing to pay you for your excess capacity. It also empowers you to accept your PowerShare stops in advance based on you schedule for the day.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a Python Flask backend that exposes a REST API that users can interact with in various ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, users that need a charge can specify their requirements through a POST to the SINK API. The endpoint is located at /rest/v1/sink.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, EV owners can meet a sink's need by sharing their car battery. That functionality is exposed via a PATCH to a particular sink addressed via an ID. The endpoint then looks like /rest/v1/sink/[id].
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third, EV owners can specify where they will be throughout their day through the EVENTS API. Users can interact with the EVENTS API via a REST calls to /rest/v1/event which then shows up in our event dashboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially our scope was too large.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal was to populate the events of a user's day through a sync with Google Calendar. We just didn't have enough time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we wanted this daily event planning to generate an email that the EV Owner could interact with and let sink owner know ahead of time when and how long their needs would be met.
                </p>

                    We pulled the front and backend together with minutes to spare.
