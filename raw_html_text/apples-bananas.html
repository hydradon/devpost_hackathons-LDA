                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We as a team felt that sustainability and reduction of waste was an important theme that needed to be addressed. We recognized that there are simple ways we can all contribute to reducing waste without much effort on a daily basis - by effectively consuming all our food before it expires. This is not easy to achieve on our own, so we decided to build an Apples&amp;Bananas - an app that help users to easily make a positive impact on the environment by reducing food waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apples&amp;Bananas helps users to reduce food waste by reminding them of approaching expiry dates. It allows users to easily input and view food items in their fridge, storing both date of purchase and date of expiry. We believe that overall, Apples&amp;Bananas has the potential to help everyone live a sustainable daily life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build Apples&amp;Bananas using the React-Native framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no prior experience to mobile development, or the React-Native framework, and so, it was difficult figuring installing the proper program and packages, as well as figuring out how to implement the functions that we envisioned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud to have built a working app and to have gained a considerable amount of knowledge of React-Native during this very short time. For most of us, this was our first every hackathon :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that difficult ideas are not impossible, and that a lot of help is available online so long as we put in the effort to find it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Apples&amp;Bananas
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to expand on Apples&amp;Bananas by having the app access online information to predict expiry dates for the user when the user does not know, for example, for produce with no specific expiry date.
