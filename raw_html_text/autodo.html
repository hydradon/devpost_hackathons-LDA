                    As we were brainstorming for an idea, we were asking everyone what change they wanted to see in their life. A sleep deprived Akhila just said "I wish I could just go to sleep and everything else is taken care of", that struck everyone as a potential idea. We discussed further and AuToDo came to be.

                    Somebody who is tired of all chores and wants a bed appearing splitting the earth just so they could sleep, needs to use our android application and click one button. The app finds everything it can do on their to-do list and simply does it. For example, all the items to be bought on the list are automatically ordered, all emails to be sent are typed and sent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an android application, using android-studio, coding in java.For the to-do list, we integrated with Evernote API. To implement the language parsing, we used Alchemy, that's hosted by bluemix IBM. For the email sending, we used Gmail Background Library. We searched for a name that matches the contact and obtained their email ID so we could send them a mail as expected.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We see us incorporating more items that could be handled from the to-do list. Book flights, sync with all devices that make a smart home, talk to Roomba, help learn something by googling it and sending an email with the summary, and maybe change the single automate button to a voice command.
