                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration was gotten from past farming experience and relationship with farmers in the rural areas and how to help them maximize profit.The problem we observed are in the pre harvest and post harvest stage.For the pre harvest, inaccessibility to funds from financial organization and improved technologies like improved cultivars, seedlings, tissue culture, fertilizer, pesticides e.t.c. whereas the post harvest is lack of storage facilities and access to wide range of market (national and international).

                <p>
                    The platform basically link up the farmers with financial institution that are giving funds , biotech companies that provide improved technologies like yam seedlings from IITA, Storage facilities like that of the warehouse at oshodi and to consumers which make up the market and it can be both national and international
