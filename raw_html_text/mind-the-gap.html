                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create an app that would increase mindfulness and positivity. Oftentimes people get stressed and become negative through the busyness of life and the portrayal of the world through media. We wanted to build an app that would allow others to journal about what good happened to them today and what good they did that day. Users would then be able to view what others have written anonymously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an app that is connected to a database. Currently, all it does is allow the user to type in what they would like to write and then swipe to a page that would have what others have written.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React-Native to build this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating with a database was a pain and took much of our time. The error messages presented on the screen were also not very informative as to what the problem was.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we don't have much, we did learn how to create a basic application in React. This was overall a great ( and frustrating ;) ) learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mind The Gap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To have the database also syncs with a remote database and be able to have multiple users be able to see updates in real time. We would also like to work on the interface and have the design be more user friendly.
