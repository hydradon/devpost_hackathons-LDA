                    Predatory journals are the scientific equivalent of fake news. They fast track the publishing of research articles through low editorial standards and non-rigorous science. These non-peer reviewed articles are damaging for researchers, the open access scientific community, and scientists looking to publish their work.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution is a browser extension that works with google chrome. The user receives a pop-up warning when they are viewing an article that comes from a potentially predatory journal.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to extract journal names from two separate lists of predatory journals: Beall's list (

                    </a>
                    ) and Scholarly Open Access (

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating Javascript into an HTML extension, formatting the predatory journal names to be searchable.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating JQuery into a google chrome extension to allow real time search of our predatory journal database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had very little previous experience with Javascript and learned how to search google for coding solutions. This was also our first experience using Github for a group coding project.

                <p>
                    Better user interface that provides animated warnings. Machine learning integration to suggest similar articles for the user that aren't from predatory journals.
