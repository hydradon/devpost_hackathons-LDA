                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As citizens who are unable to participate in this year's election, we felt the need to encourage those who are able to participate to get active.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is tailored towards young adults who may possible either be uninformed or too lazy to participate in the election. We combine many aspects of the voting process such as voter registration, introducing the candidates, and finding polling sites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming from different levels of coding experience, we decided to use a language that incorporated both front-end and back-end design so that all of our team members could play a role in the development of our innovation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering we are so close to the 2016 presidential election, we were unable to connect to the online voter registration. In addition, because of our limited HTML knowledge, we ran into difficulties implementing correct versions of the google maps API, tailoring the color scheme of the web application to our desire, and lastly, combining all of our desired design preferences in the limited time constraint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of the fact that we learned aspects of multiple programming language in a span of twelve hours. Also, we were able to successfully develop the application's framework despite several roadblocks. Lastly, we are proud that we were able to collaborate with newly discovered women with aspiration in technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Techlection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to improve the app by allowing the user to get the full experience of the google API. We also hope to tailor our application to future election not limited to presidential elections.
