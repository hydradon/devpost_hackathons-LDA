                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apart from helping us be more productive, Technology has also become intrusive and distracts our focus. We are trying to put the user back in driver's seat by giving his core job the focus it needs, by blocking all the distractions coming his way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It blocks Push notifications/messaging which is not relevant to the user's current setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are figuring out a user's current setting, based on his schedule and geographical location and serving him only the relevant notifications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
