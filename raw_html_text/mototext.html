                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Empowering persons with disabilities in ways that would allow for easier communication and living has been a passion of ours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows disabled people (e.g: transradial amputees, blind individuals) to be able to text messages without being limited by their disabilities. They wouldn't need to use voice commands. The goal of this project is simplistic texting through muscle movement rather than finger typing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Thalmic Labs Myo for the hardware to recognize the distinct muscle movement to provide commands to a mobile application built using React Native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using a Myo. Our main obstacles was integrating it into a React Native system and also understand how it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to understand the capabilities of the Myo and were able to achieve a significant milestone with the messaging software, despite having little prior knowledge of the Myo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to operate and develop with the Myo, and integrate it with a mobile application.

                    What's next for motoText
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GyroScrolling, Dictionary implementation, address book lookup, earpiece feedback and texting without being in contact with the phone.
