                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration from available hardware given by MLH and challenges from sponsers

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a simple endless runner game that is controlled only via hand gestures.  The speed of the game is linked to brain activity.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is written using the Unreal Engine, using the leap-motion controller and muse headset as input. Interaction with the muse headset is written in C++, interaction with the leap-motion controller is written in python.
