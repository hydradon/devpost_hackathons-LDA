                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration comes from our team's complaints of having to always keep track of fashion items and waiting for discounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Shoppy, we can generate a user profile, and keep track of a list of interested items online, constantly comparing their price changes, and notify by email when price shifts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way Shoppy is implemented consists of Scraping the common online retailers' websites, storing user information and websites on an double all-to-all-hashing database, and sending out notifications with SMTP library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The implementation we are trying does not fall with any of our team's past experience, so the methods are totally new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For everyone on the team, this project brought around a whole different field of vision, and introduced a number of libraries. Also, a big takeaway here is the thought process of teamwork, as of segmenting the problem into pieces, and return as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shoppy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shoppy shall need a sharp front-end interface to interact with users. This should be the direction we need to go into next.
