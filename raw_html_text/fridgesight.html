                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    IoT devices are extremely useful; however, they come at a high price. A key example of this is a smart fridge, which can cost thousands of dollars. Although many people can't afford this type of luxury, they can still greatly benefit from it. A smart fridge can eliminate food waste by keeping an inventory of your food and its freshness. If you don't know what to do with leftover food, a smart fridge can suggest recipes that use what you have in your fridge. This can easily expand to guiding your food consumption and shopping choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FridgeSight offers a cheap, practical solution for those not ready to invest in a smart fridge. It can mount on any existing fridge as a touch interface and camera. By logging what you put in, take out, and use from your fridge, FridgeSight can deliver the very same benefits that smart fridges provide. It scans barcodes of packaged products and classifies produce and other unprocessed foods. FridgeSight's companion mobile app displays your food inventory, gives shopping suggestions based on your past behavior, and offers recipes that utilize what you currently have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The IoT device is powered by Android Things with a Raspberry Pi 3. A camera and touchscreen display serve as peripherals for the user. FridgeSight scans UPC barcodes in front of it with the Google Mobile Vision API and cross references them with the UPCItemdb API in order to get the product's name and image. It also can classify produce and other unpackaged products with the Google Cloud Vision API. From there, the IoT device uploads this data to its Hasura backend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FridgeSight's mobile app is built with Expo and React Native, allowing it to dynamically display information from Hasura. Besides using the data to display inventory and log absences, it pulls from the Food2Fork API in order to suggest recipes. Together, the IoT device and mobile app have the capability to exceed the functionality of a modern smart fridge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Things provides a flexible environment for an IoT device. However, we had difficulty with initial configuration. At the very start, we had to reflash the device with an older OS because the latest version wasn't able to connect to WiFi networks.  Our setup would also experience power issues, where the camera took too much power and shut down the entire system. In order to avoid this, we had to convert from video streaming to repeated image captures. In general, there was little documentation on communicating with the Raspberry Pi camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Concurring with Android Things's philosophy, we are proud of giving accessibility to previously unaffordable IoT devices. We're also proud of integrating a multitude of APIs across different fields in order to solve this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time programming with Android Things, Expo, Hasura, and Google Cloud - platforms that we are excited to use in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FridgeSight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've only scratched the surface for what the FridgeSight technology is capable of. Our current system, without any hardware modifications, can notify you when food is about to expire or hasn't been touched recently. Based on your activity, it can conveniently analyze your diet and provide healthier eating suggestions. FridgeSight can also be used for cabinets and other kitchen inventories. In the future, a large FridgeSight community would be able to push the platform with crowd-trained neural networks, easily surpassing standalone IoT kitchenware. There is a lot of potential in FridgeSight, and we hope to use PennApps as a way forward.
