                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the number of young people who were registered to vote for the upcoming governor election but weren't sure exactly what they were voting on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tells the user how to vote and what exactly will be on their ballot when they do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used google app engine to create a web application. The languages we used for this are python, javascript, html and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to get the google address autofill API to function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of the fact that we are able to create a product even though this was a lot of our first hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how important it is to collaborate and work together especially in the initial stages of planning the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Poll It!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more features such as helping a user decide what their political party affiliation is and who they should vote for based on each issue.
