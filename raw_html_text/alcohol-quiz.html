                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by drinking games which we played already. We wanted to develop something new, a quiz game where the players can test their knowledge about alcoholism.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a quiz game for two players. It can be tested our knowledge about alcoholism by playing this game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using
                    <strong>
                        Android Studio.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding and resolving problems in code.
Giving mechanism to the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It without any errors. There is a lot of things to improve in the game, but it works just fine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to solve problems while making a bigger project. We developed our Java knowledge by declaring a lot of classes and instantianting objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alcohol Quiz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inserting challenges and "motivation" for players, extending the statistics.
We are planning to motivate the players to drink when they don't know the right answer.
