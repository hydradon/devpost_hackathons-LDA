                <p>
                    Computers are continually changing and so are the ways we interact with them. Mouse and keyboard are already being replaced by more intuitive interfaces like speech, touch and motion. Technologies leveraging speech recognition algorithms are helping us declare remote controls nostalgic objects of the past. While adjusting the volume or choosing our favorite movies is easier via speech, there are many applications in which physically performing our expected computer behavior is more accurate and intuitive than issuing verbal commands. To name a few, gestures and motion recognition can advance medical applications such as

                    We propose
                    <em>

                    </em>
                    : A hand gesture recognition system that can be readily incorporated into various new or existing projects to provide a reliable touchless interface based on hand motion.

                    provides a versatile C++ library that enables any application to declare different hand gestures and register callback functions to be called when their cooresponding gesture is performed by the user. By encapsulating hand gesture classification algorithm as well as the logic for reading and handling motion data,

// classifying gestures

classifier.registerHandler("gesture-1", &amp;func1);
classifier.registerHandler("gesture-2", &amp;func2);
classifier.run(std::chrono::minutes(10));
