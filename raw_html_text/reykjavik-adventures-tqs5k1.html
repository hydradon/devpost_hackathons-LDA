                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reykjav&iacute;k as a smart city is a big step towards the future, and we want to be a part of that!
Tourists that come to Reykjav&iacute;k have a hard time accessing information about happenings and points of interests around town. There is clearly a demand for a service that helps tourist find their way around the city. Having information about events and places in Reykjav&iacute;k, as well as information about tourists&rsquo; behaviour can then be useful to move us closer to becoming a smart city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reykjav&iacute;k Adventures is a scavenger hunt game around the city of Reykjav&iacute;k. The checkpoints in the hunt are in the form of QR-codes. The game uses information about places and events that have been gathered in a database. The idea is having QR-codes distributed at points of interest around the city centre. You can begin the game wherever you are in the city. Jump in anywhere, anytime!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This allows tourists to discover places they wouldn&rsquo;t have visited otherwise, and they don&rsquo;t have to go through the hassle of looking it up for themselves. The customers need to go to at least two checkpoints. By doing that they get 10% discount from a partner of own choice, for example swimming pools, bars, museums, etc. By adding more locations, the discounts add up (up to 50%).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The users can select criterias based on their interests. The game finds the best route based on the chosen preferences, the time you have to discover the city and the distance you&rsquo;re willing to go. If you don&rsquo;t know what you want to see or are feeling adventurous then you can also get a wildcard, where you choose your preferred distance and a random route is generated based on that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make it easier for event planners to submit their event there will be a website hosted by the City of Reykjav&iacute;k where certified event planners/venues can submit their event in a simple way. A simple information form is filled out and the information entered then becomes a part of a big database that the City of Reykjavik owns. That database can be utilized for other means as well, such as making search engines so people can look up information based on their interests.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With simple, front end programming and great team work we were able to get a clear idea of what we wanted to build, and execute it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The brainstorm took longer than we expected and then pinning down an idea we wanted to execute. It was also challenging to think big, and then having to limit the execution due to the timeframe. But his way we were able to see which part of the idea we thought was the most important to present to people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud of having worked together in good spirit as a team. We had fun during the time we were working on our project and that is certainly the most important thing! We&rsquo;ve all surprised ourselves with our skills and are proud of that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all realized a bit better where our skills are best used and what our strengths, and weaknesses, are. We also learned that we are able to do a lot of things even though we&rsquo;re working within a tight timeframe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Reykjav&iacute;k Adventures
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With improved technology, we think that we&rsquo;ll be able to integrate augmented reality into our game. By facilitating event planners to send in their events the city will be able to keep track of events going on around town. In the database, information about restaurants, bars and other points of interest will also be saved. Even though our idea is built around the scavenger hunt game, it&rsquo;s certainly not limited to that. Our vision is to be able to use that database to move Reykjav&iacute;k closer to becoming a smart city.
