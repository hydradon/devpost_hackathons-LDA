                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 2016
                    <strong>
                        political campaign
                    </strong>
                    run by Trump and team was conspicuous to say the least. He allegedly used data collection to identify certain patterns and triggers of the people. The online behavior was studied and targeted ads were launched pro Trump and anti-Clinton to even further his advantage. This gave us the idea to create a game that via
                    <strong>
                        randomness
                    </strong>
                    (in data) and
                    <strong>
                        mathematical regression
                    </strong>
                    simulates the job of a campaign manager and all the unpredictable challenges he/she has to face during a presidential campaign.
                </p>

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a
                    <strong>
                        PvP
                    </strong>
                    (Player vs. Player) turn-based, strategy game that has extremely

                        fun

                    dialogue and actions a player can take to either further his electoral advantage or
                    <strong>
                        sabotage
                    </strong>
                    and reduce the advantage the opponent has.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created a database in which the columns represent
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            3 distinct features
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    (political, behavioral and psychological) and the rows represent some randomly generated respondents who would have a coefficient for each column. Then we distributed weights on each category, thus enabling us to generate a mathematical regression to have a solid ground from which to start the game. Basically this database represents the
                    <em>
                        popularity
                    </em>
                    of each political candidate. We then created all the content of the game (actions, candidates, icons etc.) and implemented them in-game via code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we've faced was implementing all the
                    <strong>
                        actions
                    </strong>
                    in correlation with the database, so that each action taken has a tangible effect on the
                    <strong>
                        weighting
                    </strong>
                    . Another challenge was the
                    <strong>
                        design
                    </strong>
                    part. We had not anticipated so much design work to be needed, which messed up our schedule a little and made us stutter in the process. Luckily, Florin joined and helps Alex with the design of the game.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create a database that
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            pre-generates
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    (via random number generation) voter patterns, including political features, behavioral traits and also a few psychological features. We then use these
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            "respondents"
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    to generate a popularity poll, which measures how popular each candidate is at any given point. Each attribute (political, behavioral etc.) has a certain
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            weight
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    which influences (aided by player decisions) to increase or decrease exponentially the likelihood of that specific candidate to be elected president. In layman's terms: you can either create a political utopia and just softly float towards victory or create a political
                    <em>
