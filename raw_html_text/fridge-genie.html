                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The world has a major hunger problem. If we can implement technology to effectively optimize the distribution of food resources we can reduce world hunger significantly. This helps pave a way to give back to our communities and make life better for less privileged in our communities.

                    This app will assist people to stay on top of your grocery list. We can add and remove items from our grocery without a click of a button. All we have to do is say it. This app also helps keep track of expiration dates. It lets us know if things are going to expire in three days. Th gives us an option to donate to the closest food shelter to us. We can also order food from a grocery store or through amazon whole food store.
