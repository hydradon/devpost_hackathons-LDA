                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the website using Javascript, HTML, and CSS and it is being hosted on
                    <em>
                        FastSpring's
                    </em>
                    servers. The marketplace is also implemented using the
                    <em>
                        FastSpring API
                    </em>

                            mIoT-home
                        </strong>
                        uses
                        <em>
                            FastSpring's
                        </em>
                        databases to store all of our product and user information.

                            FastSpring
                        </em>
                        also takes care of all the purchases and transactions in a secure and user-friendly manner, which allows us to focus on serving our customers.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The original we had for
                    <strong>
                        mIoT-home
                    </strong>
                    was to host the website on
                    <em>
                        FireBase
                    </em>
                    servers using their API. However, we later realized that
                    <em>
                        FastSpring
                    </em>
                    offered a more competitive solution for the problem we were attempting. We eventually switched our servers to incorporate e-commerce into our website.
