                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by my friend playing another game that looked very fun! Also, when I was developing the graphics, the particles were red dots. Everyone thought they were apples so in the end, I made them apples!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You move back and forward trying to catch as many apples as you can and get the highest score you can!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using HTML5 Phaser. I used brackets.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a lot of syntax errors and problems with loops and variables.

                    I managed to fix all the problems I ran into and figured out a lot of the things on my own.
                </p>

                    I learned more about sprites, collision, particles, and sprite groups.
