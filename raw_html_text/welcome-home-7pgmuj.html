                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the power and potential of the google api for facial recognition.  As busy college students, we are always leaving and entering our apartments, as are our roommates.  We wanted a creative and fun notification for when your roommates come and go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facial recognition is used to identify when a known face enters the apartment.  Upon entering the apartment, a google home device greets the familiar face and notifies the roommates that their friend is back.  Upon leaving the apartment, the Google home bids the individual farewell and notifies the roommates that their friend has left the building.  It is also capable of recognizing strangers and will announce to the house that an unidentified person has entered the building.
