                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wolfram hack-a-thon idea generator provided a randomly generated hack-a-thon idea. We liked the idea and were up for the challenge. We originally wanted to build and program a robot of sorts but were unable to; this project filled that hole in our hearts and we soon began to love it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user-held controller made of disposable plates houses sensors which transmit data to an arduino, and ultimately to python code which converts the received data into an image. Users are able to interact with the sensors, manipulating the image on screen, or users can leave the controller untouched and watch the subtle changes in their environment paint a picture for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope to use the Arduino's accelerometer to allow the user to move the controller around in space, this would allow the user to guide the 'brush' on screen and control which sections of the image get painted which colors. as of now, the program colors the pixels in by column.
We also hope to make the controller bluetooth enabled to allow the user to move bout freely throughout their environment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We assembled a handful of sensors from the Grove Kit provided and connected them to the Grove Base shield, which was then connected to the Arduino. The Arduino is connected to a laptop which runs python and displays the image. Three sensors provide input data for color, two light sensors, and one sound sensor. The data received, in terms of voltages, are mapped onto R,G,B color spectrum values (0-255), the sound being the R value, and the two lights being G and B. Push buttons were also included in the shield in order to stop/start data collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The components were duct taped to disposable paper plates which have been fashioned together to provide a cohesive controller unit easily manipulated by the user.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Arduino to communicate with Python provided an initial challenge. We wanted to write all of the programming in python only to simplify the process, but this turned out to be more complicated then beneficial so we wrote programs in both python and Arduino.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we have run into is trying to get the accelerometer to convert data into terms of displacement, and to get the displacement values to map onto the image produced by python as to simulate the movement of the controller. Turning data from the accelerometer into values of displacement involves a double integration which exaggerates noise in the data. we haven't been able to successfully convert this data into displacement data at time of writing.

                    Also, staying awake at 3am was pretty difficult

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully created several images using the sensors and plate controller. We are able to control the rate at which the image is created and size of the image in order to increase/decrease
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Be nice to your hardware. it appreciates it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2/3 of us didn't know any arduino language at all, and have never used a Grove base shield, so we learned how to use those.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3/3 of us never did anything with images in python before, so we learned how to do that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2/3 of use have never attended a hack-a-thon so we got to learn what this experience is like. (spoilers: it's awesome)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sensor Art (Platebrush)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we continue the project back in Alfred NY, we will definitely make the python program able to track the motion of the platebrush, and we will make the platebrush bluetooth enable so we can walk around with it like madmen and still paint on python.
