                    After some research into Smart City projects, we learned that currently, world-wide, the focus is on cost-savings initiatives.  City of

                <p>
                    Municipalities purchase fresh water and distribute it to residents.  (Especially older) water distribution lines are susceptible to slow leaks &ndash; which is a gross waste of public funds.  These aren't detected until there is a sudden burst, causing massive damage.
