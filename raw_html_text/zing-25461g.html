                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was inspired by advances in personalization of AI products, like Amazon's echo, and wanted to create our own version of a personal assistant. We were further interested in Credible's proposal for a health tracking system that can integrate into the user's life as seamlessly as possible. We used these two ideas to create Zing!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Zing is a personal health tracker that monitors both your physical and mental wellness. It eliminates the frustration of keeping track of doctor appointments, diet plans, hydration levels, and exercise by keeping an easy-to-use interface for all four in one app. With easy contact with doctors and simple buttons for inputs, you no longer have to worry about scheduling a next appointment before you can get care or manually type in everything you've had to eat throughout the day. More importantly, it engages with users by allowing them to customize a character that they have to take care of (think tamagachi). This, along with the ability to challenge friends in step competitions, creates a reward system that we hope will keep users coming back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used visual design softwares to create demos. We began by brainstorming and sketching in illustrator, developed a library of assets, and implemented them through Sketch. Character design was executed in Maya and rendered out, and After Effects was used to animate a feature video.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of designers with different skill sets, we had to constantly pass our designs back and forth and test them in different softwares to make sure our app remained cohesive. We had to work quickly to ideate and build as comprehensive an app as possible in a limited amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to communicate the functionality of our app with design skills! We were able to conceptualize an app service that takes into account the busy lifestyles of users and shortened attention spans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about managing general wellness, and how general wellness relates to mental health. Our app is focused around keeping a routine because we discovered through our research that routine is one of the more successful ways to cope with mental illness.

                    What's next for Zing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next up for Zing is IOS development in XCode!
