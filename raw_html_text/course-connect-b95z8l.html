                    There are many such services which connect instructors and students and many of those are reliable too.  So what are the reasons for developing this app?  Well first is, it's free and will always be!
To provide another main reason, let me write about an example.  Suppose, a person wants to teach a course in her/his neighborhood and there are students in that area, not very fortunate to afford formal education, but curious enough to learn about that course, so these students could easily enroll for that course with just few clicks!  And it would also be easy for the instructor to keep tracks of her/his students.
Anyone from anywhere can start a course and anyone can join that course.  Obviously the instructors could add multiple courses on the catalog and students could take any number of courses they want.
So definitely designing a reliable database was one of the challenges.  Since there are many properties associated with a course, and there will be many courses, and also those courses would be taken by many students.  Therefore, to keep the track of these numbers which keep growing rapidly, fast and better data handling are required.  And this was the initial hurdle for this project.  But on continuously working on that problem I was able to come up with an efficient model.

                    Sometimes when it comes to large database implementation, many applications start losing flexibility.  However, in this app, the flexibility is maintained by giving the choice to its users to either login through their usernames or their registered emails.

                    Since there would also be personal information of users stored on this application, so the question of security naturally comes in.  To answer that, the passwords are securely encrypted and in case a user forgets her/his password then she/he can easily reset the password by getting a verification code in her/his mailbox instantly.

                    Since this is an educational app, so people may want to post educational materials on the app.  This could be the next challenge for this project.
I have hosted this application on my private Linux based Apache server.  As Linux O.S. are well known in terms of their power, so to come up with the challenge stated above, this could be achieved by FTP (File Transfer Protocol) which Linux are well known for, but more on that later.

                    Finally, I would like to conclude by quoting one of the greatest poets' view on education:  "There is no wealth like education, the more you spend it the more you earn it!"  And this app is all about connecting students and instructors with ease and free of cost!
