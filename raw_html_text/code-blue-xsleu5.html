                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration largely comes from a clinician that noticed a huge problem while in-hospital CPR was being delivered, namely that it wasn't as smooth and coordinated as it should be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our interface is meant to be used in wearable color-coded bands to distinguish the different CPR roles. Its purpose is to deliver non-verbal communication in the form of vibrations to alert individuals of the end of their task and the subsequent team- member that it is the beginning of their task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We explored several different avenues to combine accelerometer data with hardware. The avenues we explored were myo armbands, Fitbit web developer apps, Android gyroscopes as well as Matlab Arduino interfaces. We settled on using Arduino Breadboards to show the individual wristbands which we synchronized using Arduino's and circuitry. Data was extracted from the Android Mobile Apps and sent through Matlab in order to visualize the chest compressions for the CPR roles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several challenges were at play when it came to data acquisition and software assimilation alike. As mentioned earlier, the interface with the CPR roles was the most difficult. We were initially told that we had access to Myo bands which would use EMC data from chest compression and have that data exported to Arduino. However, since the Myo Bands did not arrive, the group refocused our effort on FitBits since the accelerometers can serve as a substitute for the ECM. The challenge here was that FitBit doesn't allow for the data (which we spent the majority of the night trying to hack into) to be exported out of the phone companion app. As a result the group had to refocus again. At this point, the problem was solved by using our phones and the accelerometers in them. The biggest challenge was interfacing the data with Arduino which required a lot of layers of software and coding.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we had to try so many different methods to serve as a substitute for the ECM data for the wristbands, the success we had in compiling CPR compression data was very promising. It opens up new avenues where we can now use any sensor on the android phone and export the data to Matlab for processing and also Arduino for interfacing.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Code Blue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now that the basic interface is made, the electronics must be consolidated into more wearable devices. After this, we must attach with a community of doctors to do trials with and without the armband to find out if we do cut down on dead weight time. Focus groups should also be taken to find which colors serve as the most fitting for the roles involved.
