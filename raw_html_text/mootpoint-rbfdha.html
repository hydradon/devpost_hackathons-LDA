                    Inspiration - We understood that there's a need in the market for public speakers to know how the audience reacts to them, especially during their speeches. This can be achieved through emotion sensing technology.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - We are using the Microsoft Azure API, which has been implemented into an android application (as a prototype) which will allow the user to read an individual's emotions.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - We built it using Android Studio. Splitting into three teams: Front end, back end, and API, we managed to get a functional application.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - One of the challenges we ran into was actually developing the app. It was the first time for both of the front end members. However, the main challenge that we faced was using and tweaking the actual API. It was difficult, but we eventually got into the system and it worked.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - Eating a whole pizza worth. And the fact that if not completed, we have come very close to the first end product of this service. It took a lot of hard work and only one sleepless night, fun.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - We learned new technologies and languages, and new platforms such as Android Studio, Eclipse and Microsoft Visual Studio.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MootPoint - This is only the beginning. Only our first release. There will definitely be more added functionality and more services come out. One step at a time.
