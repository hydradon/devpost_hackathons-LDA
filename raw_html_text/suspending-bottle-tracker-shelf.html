                    Inspiration: The wide diameter of a coke bottle and roller coasters
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to keep track of coke bottles that are not block by colliding rows of bottles or sandwiches, I wanted to make an object to make make stocking orderly by suspending them by the neck of the bottle. CocaCola bottles tend to have a larger neck than Pepsi bottles. To keep in mind of the customer who buy coolers and drink stocks, I wanted to retrofit existing coolers with my
                    <strong>
                        rail
                    </strong>
                    system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Coca cola plastic shelves and recycled them into rails for bottle necks. Held together by melted plastic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the front end of the rails will have spring flippers that will prevent bottles from falling from the rail, only the force of a person pulling out the bottle will release the bottle. The rail itself is tilted by a couple of degrees, to allow the bottle to fall to the front of the cooler.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used velcro as a short term solution to hang beneath the existing CocaCola shelves below the shelf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The back of the rail is an arduino that is connected to an ultrasonic sensor that detects the distance between itself and the nearest bottle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LED indicators (red, yellow, and green) will be mounted in the front of the rail. The green LED will light up when the rail is 3/4 stock - full stock. The yellow LED will light up when there is 1/4 - 3/4 stock. The red LED will light up when the rail is 1/4 stock. The red LED will blink continuously when the stock is out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Coming up with an idea that is both cheap, simple, compatible with existing shelves, indicate coke products, and friendly to customers (cooler owners).

                    Building the rail itself from existing shelves and can withstand the weight of bottled cokes.
