                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A method which is based upon memorizing digits or terms using visual associations to create a narrative
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using the Oculus Rift, the user can see different characters in an endless hallway. The characters each have a number assigned to them, and the characters can also be used to make a story. We made sure to include some interesting characters such as a dinosaur, a zombie, and a knight.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Only one person on our team had experience with Unity, and we also had various technical difficulties along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the lack of experience using Unity and C#, we were still able to create a fairly functional product
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team learned quite a bit about using different hardware along with software to create a tool which can be adapted to fit different situations in the future
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OculusPi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Expanding the hardware to include support for the Myo armband for keyboardless control through the virtual environment and allowing for user customizable inputs in order to allow for different things to be memorized
