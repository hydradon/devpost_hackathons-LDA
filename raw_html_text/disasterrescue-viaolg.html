                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many natural disasters and even man-made disasters create situations where citizens are badly harmed. Unable to contact help due to local infrastructure also being destroyed, many people are left to hope for a passing Samaritans or rescuers who are blindly sifting through the rubble.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The DisasterRescue app is designed to be a beacon and emergency communication system that brings life-saving aid to you quicker by giving rescuers location, status updates, and search assistance. When unable to remove yourself from your situation the app will emit high pitch audio frequency SOS signals that will continue until you are rescued or the battery dies. This noise will alert human and canine rescuers to your presence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio in combination with firebase and google map to create the app
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had issues with api key, database connecting to the projects, package and library updates.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    What we learned

                    Java, Mesh Networking Theory

                    What's next for DisasterRescue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hopes are to make this project bug free and add better UI options and then apply it to new hardware technology coming out. We are also trying to implement a marker system to better help locate rescuees.
