                    The fear of making and receiving phone calls is common enough to have its own name: phone phobia.
And I know I'm not alone in suffering from it.
When I discovered nexmo text-to-speech and ibm watson speech to text apis, I see the hope for us.
Instead of forcing yourself to pick up the call and talk on the phone, you can just receive a text and reply with a text.

                <p>
                    When someone calls you, instead of receiving a call, you receive a text (by using ibm watson speech to text api).
When you reply, instead of talking over the phone, you just reply with a text (by using nexmo text to speech api)
