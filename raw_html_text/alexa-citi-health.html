                    The Alexa provides the user a weekly summary of the amount of calories consumed by the user during the week and provides the user with recommendations for healthier food choices.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Citi Bank Api to authorize the User's Citi Bank Account and retrieve the user's transaction details and this provides us with the location at which the user ate. Using a Food API, we calculated the calories he consumed during the meal. Based on the recommended calorie intake per day, the Alexa provides the user with recommendations on what he/she needs to cut down from his/her diet.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to authorize the User's card details and his transaction history but we were unable to use the AWS (Amazon Web Service) to host the login webpage. We were able to train the Alexa to respond to our particular question but we could not link the Alexa to the Citi Apis
