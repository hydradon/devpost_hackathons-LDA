                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upset and affected by the three lives we lost to suicide at Stanford in the last year alone, we wanted to find a way to empower our community to intervene and help one another at the right place and time before it's too late.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes in student location and movement data, detects any significant behavior changes and alerts peers in the surrounding area that a student may be in need of help. A peer then comes into assess their friend and evaluate whether additional help is needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through using React, we developed a platform to intake activity and location data, recognize patterns and register anomalies that may be signals that a student is in distress. Notifications are then sent to peers around the area to check in on an individual, and contact Stanford resources for additional assistance if need be.
