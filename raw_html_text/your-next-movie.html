                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a recommendation system that uses ML to try to compare it with other recommendation systems.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a set of movies rated by the user, and recommends a movie to the user based on his or her ratings, providing basic information about it. It uses the LASSO method to train the model and obtain the results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used scikit-learn ML package to fit the data, and pandas to analyze it and treat it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the code form the jupyter notebook and the frontend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to train a model with few data and obtaining reasonable results, as well as having worked with machine learning for the very first time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Your next movie
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to create a frontend which makes it more usable for non-technical users, as well as providing more information about the movies and giving the user the chance to restrict the search to a particular movie genre.
