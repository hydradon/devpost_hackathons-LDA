                <p>
                    We looked at the challenges on

                    and found there was a need for a subtitling app to improve the cinema experience of deaf people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea involved:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        being capable of nudging the subtitle text forwards/backwards
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        having a sync capability that uses some form of voice recognition
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        involve an AR system that overlays the subtitle text on top of a video feed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        allow other languages to be loaded up so the film can be enjoyed by non-deaf people of other nationalities
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have a chance to finish the project, but the main idea was to use audio fingerprinting (python-dejavu) to find the exact point in the movie, then display the relevant subtitles.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how audio fingerprinting works and how to install docker.

                <p>
                    Ana learned how to measure loudness of sound to trigger an action (e.g. phone vibrates)
