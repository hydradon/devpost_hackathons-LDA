                    SCTrucks is an Android-based mobile application that allow users to locate food trucks in the nearby area. The app provides directions to the desired food truck as well as ratings, hours of opperation, and relavent tweets regarding the food truck of choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made use of both Yelp's and Twitter's public APIs to provide the data associated with each food truck and the GoogleMaps public API to direct our users reliably to their food truck of choice.

                    Our Mission
                </p>
                <p>
                    We developed this product to provide LA locals a reliable and pre-assembled database of travelling restaurants. We at SCTrucks love quality street food and strive to spread that love to as many people as possible.
