                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to engage customers using a voice-based platform with intuitive commands to eliminate stressful searches. We wanted to minimize the time customers spend on the helpline or on the website by providing them an easy way of obtaining information by speaking to their Amazon Echo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Delta4Alexa is an Alexa-powered personal assistant for all things Delta - you can ask it to find flights, check flight statuses as well as find out about the most recent TSA wait times so you can plan your trip accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the skill using AWS Lambda to host our back-end and wired it up to Amazon Alexa for deployment on Amazon Echo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We experimented with various server architectures such as Azure but ran into issues integrating our server with Amazon's endpoints and vice-versa. Hence, we decided to choose AWS Lambda to host our back-end due to its tight integration with the Alexa Skills Kit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a novel skill for the Echo that people can conveniently consume in the comfort of their homes to find flights and check flight statuses in an interactive fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Delta's API, AWS Lambda and the Alexa Skills Kit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Delta4Alexa
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Delta4Alexa could potentially be extended to booking flights, checking-in for flights or additional services for Sky Priority or Corporate Members. It could also be installed at airports and therefore obviate the need for manned helpdesks.
