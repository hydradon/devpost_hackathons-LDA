                    We could all use a little less time on social media. ScrollToll attempts to reduce social media usage by utilizing a browser extension that attaches a monetary value to page visits. While a small amount of use is fine, the moderate 50 cent charge quickly becomes prohibitive at high usage. It's like a digital swear jar where 100% of the funds are donated to women's charities!

                    ScrollToll helps you spend less time on the internet while donating some dollars to charity. In the extension, you choose which website or websites you need help limiting scrolling time. These may include social media websites that often leave you feeling guilty after scrolling for hours instead of using the 24 hour gym membership. Some examples may include facebook, reddit, and cutenessoverload.com. With this extension, you donate 50 cents to charity every time you visit one of your token websites. In the extension, you can see the total donated the charity as well as the history of your payments.

                    Everyday, people all over the world log into social media websites and applications. "Nearly 20% of total time spent online in the US across both desktop and mobile devices is on social platforms." -Business Insider, 2016. Our mission is to help you decrease your scroll-wasting time while helping charities along the way.
