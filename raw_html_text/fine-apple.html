                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group consists of all students who currently attend university/ college. We believe that college students have a lot to handle such as classes, tests, homework, clubs, rent, and tuition. They do not necessarily have time to think about what to make for dinner because they are constantly juggling various activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides healthy food ideas based on  taste, BMI, and cuisine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using Android studio. We made this app through Java. With this we displayed images of various food items using cloudinary based on the user's preferences. We also used a google API NLP which helped us create a more interactive environment where the user can directly message the API for suggestions. They can ask questions like "Can you suggest Mexican food?" and an item and it's recipe will be displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge during this process was understanding how to import our images from cloudinary to our app. Although most platforms can do this through a simple process, using android studio plus java took a lot of research and hands to figure out.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off using flutter and found that we were completely stuck for hours. We decided to reflect back and use what we knew (Java) to build it through Android studio instead. As we kept going, we came up with more ideas and were able to include so many platforms because of that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all came here with no knowledge of building apps. With Teamwork and the help of mentors, we started off simple, and slowly built up our idea more and more which gave us a thorough and hand on understanding of cloudinary, Google NLP API, and android studio

                <p>
                    We want to be able to click on the images and provide the recipes and amount of calories for each food item.
