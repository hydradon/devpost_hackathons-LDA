                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made a very elementary form of snake using Java in high school and I wanted to see if I could do a more complex version now, using Python.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently it does not do much. I built the general outline of the code but did not have a lot of time to put it together. So currently, it makes the game for each of the faces with various prizes or obstacles on each face, located in random positions.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I coded solely in Python. I played around with classes, which I knew a little bit about from my high school AP Computer Science course, but I have not touched object oriented programming in Python yet, as I am only taking the introductory Python course this semester.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not know object oriented programming with Java before this. I had trouble accessing the classes that I made in other python files. I was trying to stay organized but it ended up being more complex than I anticipated. Additionally, I have not had any experience working with graphics. I tried to make it so that the game would appear on a window. Finally I did not know quite how to actually have the code input commands from the keyboard.

                <p>
                    I did figure out how object oriented programming worked in python for the most part. Although I did not get quite as far in this project as I wanted to, I learned a lot and I think I got a considerable amount done considering how unfamiliar I am with programming and that I got a later start than I wanted. (Originally I had been working on the sleep challenge with some friends, trying to use the sound sensor from the grove kit to monitor sleeping cycles and use it to give advice to the customer. However, I have even less experience working with a board and eventually decided to switch to this idea instead.)

                <p>
                    I learned a lot about python's object oriented programming as well as trouble shooting.

                <p>
                    I am going to try and figure out how to smooth the connections, take input from the keyboard, and actually display the game board.
