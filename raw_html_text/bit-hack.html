                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever users have to use a cloud service then most of them are afraid of selecting a proper service as there are too many platform which provide same services which make very complex to decide by the users. Another problem is that they are not sure which service is best for them and hiring a proper expert can cost them a lot so there is requirement of user friendly platform where users can compare different services and select required service then control and monitor different services from same platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
