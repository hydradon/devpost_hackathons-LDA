                    The existing flight cancellation system does notify the client when a flight has been cancelled, and the user is required to reach out to customer service via phone to find out the next steps of the procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the conducted surveys customers find this process tedious and time consuming. 
And as a result, this affects the company reputation and customer satisfaction.

                    What's next for JetBlue Cancellation Module
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To improve the service, JetBlue decides to work on the implementation of alter methodologies in case of flight cancellation.
A proposed solution is not only to notify the customer in any cancellation scenario but also provide an interface with all the upcoming flights, which will facilitate the user to rebook the flight instantly, with only one click!
