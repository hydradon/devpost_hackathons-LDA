                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a Lumosity-style application that would heighten your brain functions and give you scores according to how well you do in each function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It trains your memory
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with ideas and did research and collaborated to make it happen
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to have multiple minigames crammed into one big project, but we only got this one minigame done
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got it working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't code when tired. Bad idea.

                    What's next for Memory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may add a reaction time feature
                </p>
