                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is hard to wake up at a hackathon once you are sleeping. It is hard to wake up from a nap after school. In general, it is hard to wake up. So we wanted to make something that had a purpose
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an alarm clock that automatically donates to your charity if you don't wake up on time. You have to manually check off that you got up otherwise it will automatically donate to the charity of your choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built on swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of bugs in the beginning. Some of our code only worked for an earlier version of Swift, so we had to use trial and error to get it working again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rohan and Sushanth came into this hackathon with no knowledge of Swift and iOS develoment. At the end of the hackathon, they had experience creating designs and integrating it into an iOS project. Keshav helped them pick the fundamental skills so that they could contribute to this project effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    From Previous Projects
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired from some of the previous projects we had made. We used code from open source libraries for handling user storage and previous projects for handling time change and notification.
