                    Information is exploding. Time is money. We love saving money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to summarize long textual information, and often it is not summarizable. Instead, we should extract key phrases only, like what we do for preparing an exam: highlighting what we think are important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    we TL;DR everything.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given a txt or pdf file, it reads the content and extracts or highlights sentences related to the given keywords. If no keywords are given, it automatically extracts topics and gives key sentences. The results are shown in the application and can be saved to a txt file with markdown syntax that highlights the extracted information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also gives an interesting link related to the context, for some curious and diligent user, as additional materials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first process the textual information and extract the main topics of the text using LDA. Then we compute for each sentence its score which indicates how much it is related to the keywords, or the topics if the keywords are not given. In this step, we use the word2vec model
                    <code>
                        GoogleNews-vectors-negative300
                    </code>
                    in order to compute the similarity. We also google a related article or website that is related to the topics and recommend this as additional reading. Finally, we build a UI for interacting with users, let user to choose text or pdf file to be processed, the way to show the key sentences, keywords etc.
