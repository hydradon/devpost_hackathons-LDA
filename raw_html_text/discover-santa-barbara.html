                    Finding local entertainment can be an important step in familiarizing one's self to a new environment and feeling at home. This is especially the case in a smaller, suburban city like Santa Barbara. Our app, Discover Santa Barbara, is essentially a compact, mobile introductory guide to some key highlights, that a new resident in search of activities to fill their weekends would not be immediately aware of.

                        We used Xcode, applying Swift.

                    <p>
                        As beginner coders, we were unfamiliar with the differing commands associated with different versions of Swift. We also struggled with setting constraints on multiple elements on our ViewController.

                        The whole process, and the fact that we have a final working product!  We've never coded before. EVER. And are very happy to have the opportunity to begin our journey into coding at this hackathon.

                        We learned the basics of Python, Swift, git and github, how Xcode works, and what data science is.

                    <p>
                        Our original idea was considerably more ambitious than our current skills could successfully achieve. We plan to improve our coding knowledge and skills so we can incorporate the following features into Discover Santa Barbara: more pages/categories of activities, a customizable activity schedule, the snapchat map to let users see public stories for the activities listed, and Smartcar API so users can see if their friends are nearby via their vehicle locations, providing an opportunity to facilitate a possible rideshare and group activity.
