                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Synchronizing data between our app and the Alexa Skills Kit was somewhat challenging.  The Alexa Voice SDK is also lacking some features. Also, due to the lack of nearby places, we had to fake our GPS location to the center of Times Square.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AVS working on a phone was challenging. Also, doing a voice-oriented demo in 60 seconds was pretty tight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voice recognition is great! ASK is very easy to use. It's very challenging to do AVS on a non-echo device, however.
