                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the brainstorming session for this project, we were especially interested in the idea of creating something that aimed to contribute to social good. With more than 90 people die in car accidents everyday, we set our sights on creating something to minimize hazardous driving conditions. We got the idea to target tired drivers because there is only so much car music can do before it joins the lullaby drone of the sound of a car rolling down the highway.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the web application allows the user to choose between playing audio-based games by themselves or to connect with another sleepy driver. The calling feature has not been fully implemented yet. There are also options to play audio games with another person over the phone. These games have been designed and chosen to keep the driver awake at the wheel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I, Abigail Fink, worked mostly on the front end aspects of the website. I designed the layout of the app and implemented it in raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also designed the web app's logo. The backend is still a work in progress. We got the domain "
                    <a href="http://www.longhaul.live" rel="nofollow">
                        www.longhaul.live
                    </a>
                    " from
                    <a href="domain.com" rel="nofollow">
                        link
                    </a>
                    , and are currently trying to connect it to a Google Cloud Bucket, but the DNS settings of our domain take some time to update. We are serving our static website files through that Cloud Storage Bucket, and then planning on using Twilio in a Python Flask app hosted on Google Cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We also ran into difficulty implementing Twilio API into our application to enable browser calling. We are running a python Flask server since that is what my teammate. Brando Mora, is very familiar with. Unfortunately for him, there are not very many resources specific to browser-browser calling for Flask. I, personally, had some trouble formatting html correctly as I am still relatively new to CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are both very happy with the way the website's logo turned out and the overall layout of the website. Though the formatting is not going to be to the caliber of something a giant company like Google, would make, we both agree that it is pretty good considering the (lack of) experience I had coming in. We also very much enjoy the overall layout of the WebApp since it is sensible and sleek
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to better integrate the main three languages of web development to make something visually appealing. I also gained a more conceptual understanding of what the frontend encompasses and where it ends. My partner, Brando Mora, learned more about backend technologies like Twilio and Google Cloud, along with the overall architecture of these technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LongHaul
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To start, we want to finish our work on the minimum viable product we have attempted to make at this hackathon. We would like to make audio calling more interactive by also incorporating a listener into the call stream that would be able to accept input via voice to make voice games more interactive and hopefully engage driver's brains more so they don't fall asleep. Eventually I would like to rewrite the html and css I have created in terms of the React Framework. My partner would also like to migrate his Flask code into a Node.JS Express application, since these are both more standard and sought after skills in web development.
