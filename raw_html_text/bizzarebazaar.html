                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was born out of the problem I faced at the end of every semester. I had too much stuff lying around which I just wanted to get rid of.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows users to barter items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using iOS and my teammate built it on Android. The app uses a Parse backend and Uber API to allow users to call an Uber from within our app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had never worked with asynchronous functions/blocks before and this was a major challenge. Additionally retrieving a JSON object and parsing through it proved challenging in Swift especially since it was my first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to deep link Uber into our app. Users are given an estimated fair and time from within our app and can then call an uber to go pick up an item they'd like to trade in for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to interact with an API, deep link apps and use asynchronous functions. This was also the first time I used a relational database of any kind which I built using Parse

                    What's next for BizzareBazaar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to implement chat into the app. After that we need to clean up the UI, refactor the code a little bit (we had to use some hacks this weekend) and then we are ready for a first launch
