                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that would allow disabled/immobile people to experience StateFarm in a new way. We thought it would be nice to create this user experience so that we can make sure that everyone can experience really cool technology along with very convenient services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of right now, the app only shows the environment in which the end user will be interacting with. The goal is to let the user visit a booth and do specific actions to their StateFarm account. In this example, we have 3 booths, one to pay for bills, deposit your checks and transfer between multiple authorized accounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to build the environment thanks to Anthony Veserra. C# and the Unity SDK were used to build out some interactivity with the environment such as head movement with the help of Michael Leeser-Smith, Rajeev Goonie and Adriana Holley. We were able to find all of our features needed using Agile/SCRUM methodologies with the guidance of Miggy Reyes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware and download speeds were the biggest challenges to our development process. We had to switch from Oculus to HTC Vive because the Oculus did not want to connect to Michael's laptop. We realized this maybe 8 hours in. The learning curve to connecting scripts to GameObjects was very high as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to develop with languages and syntax that were new to us, and working together to develop and build our idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this competition, we learned how to code using the C# coding language, Unity framework, and SteamVR library. We also learned how to work together as a team and follow Agile/SCRUM methodologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StateFarm in VR?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Banking (Deposit, Transfer Money as well as make payments), Private File uploads, ID records, Customer Support. We came up with these features based on the already implemented StateFarm mobile app.
