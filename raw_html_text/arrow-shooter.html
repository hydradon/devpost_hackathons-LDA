                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used to play a lot of archery games back when flash was popular. Now my teammates and I have the opportunity to build upon them with our very own game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A normal archery target practice game but as the levels progress, the more room for error! The amount of archers to control also increases leading to all kinds of situations!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote it all in Haxe and used the HaxeFlixel library to aid us. It compiles to HTML5, Flash, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble with coding the physics of the arrows as they can collide which drastically increases the complexity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WE learned a new approach to programming games.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We plan to add more levels and flesh it out more
