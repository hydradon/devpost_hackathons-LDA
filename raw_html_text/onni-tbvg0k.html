                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile payments in China have become so pervasive that I got funny looks when I tried to pay for something in cash. And they have a point - it's incredibly convenient. Why doesn't the US use a mainstream wireless payment platform?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A merchant (a restaurant, etc) charges a client for an item by displaying a QR code. By scanning the QR code, the client immediately completes the purchase. No middle man, no waiting, no wallet, this all happens at the tap of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the provided API's by NCR as well as HTML, CSS, NodeJS and Python to integrate our idea into a web platform and mobile application. The web platform authenticates the merchant and supplies a QR code based on the purchase details while the mobile application registers the QR code and instantly transfers money from the client to the merchant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Silver API permission was restricted, so we had to use a proxy to build around the issue. Additionally, we encountered issues with JavaScript and CSS while building a functional site. Lastly, conflicting modules in Android Studio presented some of the bigger problems that we ran into.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to be able to bring the movement of instant, wireless transactions to the US by directly implementing methods that have been proven to work. By working closely with NCR, we have been able to gain a fundamental understanding of the problem, and more importantly, how our solution will revolutionize the marketplace forever.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most team members had little to no experience working with APIs. This fixed that. Additionally, we learned how to delegate tasks and quickly learn new skills in order to maintain an adaptive and faced pace workstyle.

                    What's next for Onni
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two-way interactions (the customer can show a QR code for the merchant to scan as well as the other way around) and a cross platform mobile application that runs across all devices (androids and iOS).
