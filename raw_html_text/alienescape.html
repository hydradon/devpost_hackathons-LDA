                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the two amazing instructors to make a game as complicated and difficult as possible to make something different from what is currently on the market. The game was made to be very hard so that I would encounter more problems in creating it. This was my first time coding in swift and I wanted to try out as many different functions and mechanics as possible. The goal was to learn so much so that I already had code for any possible future app or game ideas without having to encounter those big conflicts in the future or at least being more prepared to tackle them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My games is a Puzzle/Strategy game that tests the user's problem solving ability, speed and adaptability to new mechanics and it allows the user to explore the virtual universe created within the game as the user progresses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it's a level based game, I have a Game Scene for each of my levels but I use only one general Swift file that sets the parameters for all the levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift doesn't have a Projectile motion prediction line, so I am the first person that was able to code it in swift using Physics and Mechanical Engineering and of course getting a lot of help from my instructors. (Thank you) I'm currently working on releasing the code separately on GitHub so that no one has to go through that struggle to create a motion prediction line.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Helping other students develop their projects by sharing my code, brainstorming with them on their games and working on their assets to make their games better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to not give up, even if it seems like your code is completely not working because you probably forgot something small or used "and" instead of "&amp;&amp;." It's really about the process, not the result. Also to run your problems and ideas through your friends, they'll always give you some valuable input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AlienEscape
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm continuing working on expanding the virtual universe, creating new levels, making new cooler skins and in game items. The next big thing is going to be making my universe from 2D to 3D so that the experience of exploring the universe becomes a lot more fun.
