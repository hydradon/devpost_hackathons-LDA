                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members Erick had the inspiration from his own experiences with therapy. He saw that there was often a disconnect between the therapist and the patient that caused a lot of miscommunication and stress for both side. This would especially happen outside the sessions when the tharapist and the patient had no way to communicate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app facilitates the communication between a therapist and their patient by allowing them to share entries, comments, and feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a basic starter kit for react-native in order to not only learn the framework by scratch but also build the platform a lot faster. In addition, we used python for the backend to handle sign-in requests, entry request, and other API calls. We also used twillio for reminders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because react-native and in general react was completly new to us we were having trouble connecting our backend and our front-end. In addition, we constantly ran into problems when merging certain components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were successful with using the twillio api. In addition, we designed a really good looking front-end mobile design with the user in mind. We are also really proud of the fact that this idea is really practical and can actually really help make life easier for those suffering from mental illnesses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about the languages we thought we knew pretty well. We also learned an entire new framework in a day while also learning new APIs. In addition, our knowledge of SQL was also improved along with how to work together as a taem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for speranza
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue working with speranza and develop a more flushed out versions with more features to continue making life easier for both the therapist and the patient.
