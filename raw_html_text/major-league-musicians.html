                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many times, people predict that an artist will become successful based on their talent long before the artist is popular. I found myself in that situation several times and I wished that there was something I could do about my predictions. Combining that problem and my love for sports, I thought of Major League Musicians which would be like Fantasy Football except with your favorite Musicians instead of Football players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was intended to be a game similar to Fantasy Football, but rather than selecting players and receiving points based off of their performance, you buy stocks of Spotify artists. Every day, the stock of the top 100 artists on Spotify (based off of their popularity and followers) would be calculated. Throughout the month users can buy and sell stocks to try and take the lead in their tournament. However, there were more difficulties than anticipated and so we eventually settled for a prototype of our Major League Musicians program along with a combination of simulators (including Conway's Game of Life and a Pet Stick!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use a JavaScript implementation so that each of the users could access their stocks online and interfacing between users would be simpler. It could also be accessible from a variety of devices, rather than just Android or just PC.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge that we ran into was tasks that ended up being impossible for students at our skill level in this timeframe. For example, although we were successful in creating and populating a database, we were unable to read from this and actually utilize it (at least in Javascript). Additionally, although we managed to implement an Authenticator so that users could log in, this was difficult to connect to the rest of the project. We eventually decided that these aspects would be dealt with over a larger time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the Authenticator working, we were able to use the Spotify API to get artists details and store them in our database, and we successfully used domain.com and firebase together to create our website and make it public. We were also able to use CSS to make our website fun and entertaining and we had fun while doing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned that before deciding on a project, we should determine what is and is not feasible to do during our time frame. At first, we planned on implementing many features that we could not actually implement with our current level of knowledge. In the future, we will make sure that each aspect of our projects is feasible. We will also make sure that we are experienced in each aspect of the programs that we plan on implementing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Major League Musicians
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After this, Major League Musicians will continue to work on this project and attempt to learn more so that we can eventually succeed. We also plan on entering other Hackathons and beginning new projects.
