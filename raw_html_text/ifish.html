                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the challenges facing fish populations around the globe from over-fishing to climate change.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows fishermen and other people aboard fishing vessels to record their fishing trips and catch in order to increase the aggregation of fish data collected around the world.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first determined what kinds of data the fish-folk would need to collect by talking to a few experts in the field. We then developed an easy to use app that was as simple as possible to simplify the data-collecting process.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to determine which fields were necessary to be collected, and setting up a uniform data standard so that the data would be easily transferred between states, countries, and continents.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building an app that may help with the awful problem of over-fishing and creating a data standard that could help integrate fishing data worldwide.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the atrocities of over-fishing and the problems fishermen face when trying to

                    What's next for iFish
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add support for other data-collecting tools to lessen the amount of data that the fish-folk have to input by hand.
