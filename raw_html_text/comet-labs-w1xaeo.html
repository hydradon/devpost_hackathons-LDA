                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding research on campus is a difficult and cumbersome process. It starts out by going through a university's directory of professors. You have to then email them to even find out if they are looking for undergraduate researchers. Professors and busy people and they often get hundreds of emails a day so it would be very easy to never get a response. Now imagine if applying for a job was like that.
