                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've personally spent a lot of time on various buses, contemplating which bus I would be if I were a bus.... Unfortunately my curiosity could not be satiated because no one had ever made a way to find out. So I took fate into my own hands and created my own solution that I can share with the world. Now no one will ever wonder in uncertainty what Rutgers bus they would be. They can just take my quiz!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app asks you questions about your personality and tells you which Rutgers bus you are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used XCode and Swift to make this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first app I've ever made, so I ran into a lot of issues with the interface builder, making the layouts look consistent throughout different IOS platforms  and sizes (iPhones, iPads), I had some basic syntax misunderstandings that I've since learned from (ex. I forgot to add "static" to all my variables and was wondering why they kept resetting to 0 every time the app moved to the next view controller class).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of this accomplishment because it is really the first real app I've made myself without any guidance. I took CS 111 last semester and have been learning swift and Xcode for only about a month now. (I'm an alumnus that graduated last year as a humanities major)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Again, I learned some basic syntax stuff (like the difference between Static Var and just Var within a class), as well as how to use constraints and stack views better in XCode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rutgers Bus Quiz: "What Rutgers Bus Are You?"
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for this app is to hopefully have it finish being in review at the App Store and put a link of it on the Rutgers Meme page for people to find out what RU bus they are!
