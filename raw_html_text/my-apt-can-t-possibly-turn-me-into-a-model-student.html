                    It is an interactive website with interactive activities to lead us to our game.

                <h2>
                    We built this game with mainly HTML and CSS. There are other aspects to it too such as Renpy and botkit.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into We ran into challenges with Renpy. We are both new to Renpy so issues regarding renpy are not an easy fix.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I am proud that we both get to compete into this environment.

                    What I learned: Ronnie and I learned a lot from this Hackaton. We are not computer science majors so this hackaton was an incredible learning experience. She learned how to code a bit and I became more familiar with CSS style sheets.

                    What's next for My APT Can't Possibly Turn me into a Model Student!? What is next is to take data from our surveys and expand on what students see there is a lack of direction to. It is important that students find all the necessary resources needed
