                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind getaway is a personal experience I had last year where I planned out a trip to montreal for me and many friends. After finally getting there and no one knowing what they were doing, I could see there was a problem to be solved

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works by a user entering their starting and ending location, and their preferred method of transportation, and it calculates forms of transportation, accommodation, and entertainment for you.
