                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Our story begins with four nerds who love to code. For all of us, this was our
                        <strong>
                            first
                        </strong>
                        Hackathon, and excitement brewed in each of us. Originally, the team was just three: Alexander Stangl, Annie Xie, and Taylor Jean-Jacques. Each one of us had experience in Java programming, but beyond that, we were venturing into the unknown. As Alex sat at a table with seats reserved for the two ladies, a friend of his approached the table. It was Carl Sun, a friend and fellow from his Zee group in Blair. Alex mentioned that two of the seats were reserved, but that Carl was more than welcome to sit down for dinner. Eventually, Alex offered Carl the opportunity to join his team, and Carl was happy to accept.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the first day, we gathered in Friend 101 and threw ideas around. From a social alarm clock that lets friends set reminders for events to an automatic schedule maker for what major you wanted, we definitely had plenty of exciting prospects. However, as we considered each one, we found ourselves unsatisfied as we gave them more thought. They just didn't
                        <strong>
                            click
                        </strong>
                        , you know? Anyway, as we were going through Carl's list, we arrived at an idea that immediately excited us in a way unlike the others. He presented the idea of an app that would expedite communication on social events, especially with parties that the eating clubs would host. He complained that at the beginning of the year, he felt like he was left out of the loop whenever he found out about a party the day of, from a friend on Facebook who just seemed to be much more popular and "in the conversation." It was incredibly frustrating to him, and since then, he'd been wishing for someone to come up with a better communication system for this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After discussing how to go about furthering this idea and tweaking it around, we decided on an app similar to the Princeton Mobile App. It would be developed on Android Studio, which worked out well with our mutual Java experience. There were definitely some obstacles to debate over, such as the security risks of stalking or how to limit party knowledge to certain people vs. everyone who downloads the app. After discussing through these, we went to workshops: Taylor and Carl went to Android Studio, and Alexander and Annie went to Ideation (just in case).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After finalizing the decision to work on this app, we began the process of coding and designing. Late into the wee hours of the morning and with plenty of coffee and sugar to run on, we slogged through learning Android Studio and designing the interfaces and activities of the app. Frustration fluctuated throughout the past two days, but here we are, with a basic finished product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And so, we present to you: Fear Of Missing Out? No Mo! The app of a social Tiger's dreams, it currently allows an individual to find out who's at all the eating clubs tonight, and check themselves into an eating club for friends to see! Currently, it's logging in by entering your name, and choosing a "Here" button next to the eating club of your choice! And that's it! Simple for now, but regardless of the results of this Hackathon, if we get enough support from our fellow Princeton students, we're more than happy to update and continue work on it. Thank you for looking at our app, and we hope you feel just as excited about it as we are!
                    </p>
