                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating our first ever hack and coming from a strong musical background in marching band, drumline, pop, and symphony orchestras, we wanted to use our knowledge to help others.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program interprets EEG brain wave data from a MUSE device and recommends a song based on emotional state.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first spent a lot of time playing around with the MUSE device, seeing the chart readings as we listened to calm and exciting music. We then saved the recordings as .txt files and parsed through them with a Java program.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Converting .muse data into a usable form in Java. Understanding the brain wave data.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing a program that is able to examine an enormous data set to output meaningful suggestions.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first time hack-a-thon-ers and beginners in computre science, I learned a lot about how to read files and do various manipulations of the data.
