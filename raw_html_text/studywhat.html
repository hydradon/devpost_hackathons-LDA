                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Being someone who is new to programming, I wanted to create an app that was both simple yet useful at the same time. In college, I run into a problem in which I have a lot to review before an upcoming test or exam. With all these terms I have to keep track of in my classes, it's difficult to prioritize what is needed most. Therefore, I have created an app that helps solve this issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -StudyWhat? is an application that helps a person figure out WHAT they need to STUDY first of the many terms that they need to review in classes. You can take a confidence survey in the app and rate how confident you feel about specific terms in classes you are taking on a scale from 0 to 10. From 0, meaning "I know absolutely nothing", to 10, meaning &ldquo;I&rsquo;m basically a pro." After taking the survey, StudyWhat? sorts the terms from least understood to most understood based on the confidence scores YOU select. This lets you know what to focus on and what to prioritize to make the most out of your study sessions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    StudyWhat? lets you know what you rated each specific term the last time you took the confidence survey. It also makes the slider and the score adjust to the previous score so you know whether you improved or have forgotten the term.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -I am proud of actually finishing the main functions of my app and actually improving my programming skills. It was really cool seeing what steps to take into making an app and actually creating one myself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StudyWhat?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -I might add a better use for the second tab bar item I have in my app. I might have it combine all overall terms and scores in every subject so you can see your results all in one place of what you need to work on. I also might also add a way to view definitions of the terms you input. Or I might take out the second tab bar item and just create everything all in one for simplicity.
