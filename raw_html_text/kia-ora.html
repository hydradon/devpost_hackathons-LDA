                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that there weren't any apps for mental health support for students on the app store and we wanted to create a resource where students could go if they start feeling overwhelmed because no one should have to go through it alone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app has four buttons that lead to different resources based on what the student wants. One button leads to an interface similar to a task interface where students can go to enter exam/assignment dates. Another button leads to an anonymous communication service where the user(anonymous) can talk to a bot using the Slack API. The third one, allows students to listen to motivational or calming audio. The fourth one allows the user to upload positive visual media for other students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Android Studio with Java(Android) and .xml files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it challenging to implement an API for a chat bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was our first app, we did not have prior knowledge in Android App development. We learned a lot of new things in a short amount of time and we're proud of the functionality we were able to achieve given the circumstances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to navigate through Android Studio and about the integration of .xml files with modified java(android) code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kia Ora
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more functionality to the project. The fourth button will be up and running. We will have more audiovisual media as a positive resource for students everywhere. The task interface will be fully functional and we will add push notifications with encouraging messages as students get closer to exams and get more overwhelmed. The API will be connected and the bot will be fully functional, allowing users to anonymously communicate and feel support anywhere, anytime.
