                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ruby-On-Rails as our framework and Materialize as the material design styling, along with basic HTML and CSS.Our version control was Github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nobody in the group had a strong grasp of Ruby-On-Rails, so it was a lot of learning about the framework itself. We had also not specifically used Materialize before and were trying to get the Polymer gem to work beforehand. We decided to switch to Materialize when it wasn't working. Finally, none of us had ever deployed to Heroku before and that was a struggle because the project came nested and Heroku didn't register our project as a Rails project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works! It's deployed to Heroku!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have a much stronger grasp on Rails and a better feeling for material design in general and Materialize specifically.

                    What's next for Imposter.me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add tagging so that you can search the posts by topic, as well as authenticate users and offer login/logout functionality.
