                    : To start with, I'm a marathon runner and i met my GF at my company's running squad, when we were practicing 
for a Marathon event. Usually i use to run with her,so that she tries to run faster than me. when the event nears 
we looked her past record and noted that whenever we ran together those timings were good, also whenever she ran alone
her timings were slow. we got to know that whenever someone runs with us we try to push our limit and also it will be a healthy 
competition. As we couldn't find any app which satisfy our needs,we tried a one for real time run tracking between two individuals
from any part of the world.
