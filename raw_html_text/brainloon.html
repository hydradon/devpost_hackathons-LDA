                    Have you ever tried to lift up objects just with your brain? Well, BrainLoon makes it possible!
Controlling a ballon is already a hard task, but what if you were tied up and had only your thoughts to control it?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the game you are in a balloon flying over countryside. There are many challenges to overcome, such as big clouds and angry tornados. As the game progresses you start to notice how the surroundings are slowly being destroyed by humanity. The Earth is in danger and we need a Think.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does it work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Muse headband measures the players brain activity using 5 electrodes. The signal is being processed using machine learned algorithms, thus moving the player on vertical axis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Configuring the Muse turned out to be quite a challenge and took a significant amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the amount of data that we were able to capture and process with the help of the neural network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be near impossible to use the output of muse manually. However, using modern technology, it turned out to be doable under 24h.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BrainLoon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, it would be possible to add more freedom to the player by adding various actions controlled by other Muse outputs such as accelerometers, different frequency rage EEG. Our data capturing system is viable for further research or implementation in other games.
