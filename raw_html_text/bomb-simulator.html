                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came to this hackathon with no idea and little to no developing experience. But we knew we had the potential for greatness. Assembled within this team are the people most capable of coming up with useless ideas. We decided to put this untapped potential to use in this hack. The bomb simulator.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It counts down, It beeps, It does everything a bomb does except the part that make a bomb a bomb, the bomb.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an arduino to make the bomb simulator and used a raspberry pi to add remote accessibility to the bomb simulator

                    No experience in hardware. At all.
