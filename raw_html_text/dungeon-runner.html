                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first game jam as well as my teammates. We didn't spend enough time in the beginning fleshing out our idea properly. This led to us not using our time as efficiently as possible therefore leading to not being able to implement all the elements we wanted to.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we participated in the game jam and that we were actually able to submit a playable demo.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork and communication are the most important aspect of building a game.

                    What's next for Dungeon Runner
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the use of all of the artifacts we intended to use in the game. As well as adding the traps to make navigating the maze more of a challenge.
