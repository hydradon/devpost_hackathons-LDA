                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Growing up with consoles and controllers, members of the Sculptic team have always felt more immersed in a world with a little bit of shakiness. We wanted to integrate haptic feedback (more specifically vibration) into the controllers of the future - like Leap Motion's virtual hands. Sculptic has the ability to make a VR experience into something even more immersive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sculptic is a glove-like device to be worn over the hand. It has vibration motors at key points over the fingers and palm, along with an LED for additional effect. It provides a unique and varied set of haptic feedback to the user, which is fully programmable, customizable, and more versatile than any controller.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Particle Photon board so that our game, programmed in Unity, could send POST requests using the REST API and make changes to the state of the Sculptic. This is what allows us to create an integrated gaming/interactive VR experience just from Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Particle Photon board occasionally has connection issues, and seems to relish in its failure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have managed to integrate a wide variety of different technologies into one working, compete project, and we've learned a lot throughout the process!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned about interesting and useful connection APIs, as well as tidbits from game design, and firmware algorithms. We've also learned how to work together over the course of a long weekend with minimal rest!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sculptic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't know if Sculptic will ever become a commercial success, but with the Rabbit Hole VR club and their hardware, we here at the Sculptic team intend to spend a good number of nights in Lab 64 making and playing truly interactive games with the Sculptic!
