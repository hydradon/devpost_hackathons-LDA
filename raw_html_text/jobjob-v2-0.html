                <p>
                    Finding a suitable job out in the job search market takes MASSIVE AMOUNT of time and effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Many jobs are not found at all or even completely left outside of the scope of conducting research, because job applicants are not equipped with knowledge on keywords to find fitting jobs.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Job posts are far from transparency on the metrics that actually matter to job seekers; Company culture &amp; who are the colleagues, company financial success, what the job is actually like.
                        </p>
                    </li>
