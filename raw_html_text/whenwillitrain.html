                    When we set out to make a project for Hack Western 4, one aspect that we really wished to pursue was the functionality of the project. In the case of most hackathons, the hack itself is highly conceptual, and often many parts are there just for show. Teams also end up having to hard-code some of the components they wish to demo, which is bad coding practice.

                    With Will It Rain, we made an interactive simplistic website that will ask the user for a city, and tell the user when it will next rain or snow in that city. We accomplished this by making use of a micro web framework known as Flask and a Hack Western exclusive API by The Weather Network. Along with Materialize, a front-end framework, we created a simplistic, beautiful website that gives the user well-formatted information about precipitation.
