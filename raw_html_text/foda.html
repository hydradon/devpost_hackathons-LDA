                    Android app for translating and visualizing words. 
Our original idea was to create an app that lets you take a picture of food menu in foreign languages, then shows the translation along with a picture, so you have better ideas of what to expect. 
In the future, we'd like to include features for showing ingredients and detailed descriptions of the dish as well.
This app can be very useful, not just for understanding menu at restaurants, but also for learning new languages!
