                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a large communication gap between healthcare providers, hospital settings, and patients that leads to decreased healthcare productivity, obstructed patient experience, and increased costs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a medical LinkedIn where GPs, PTs, specialized physicians, and patients can easily interface with one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Circulo using Python through Django, a free and open source web framework. We set up our own local server and set up pages on the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have enough time to implement features that we had initially envisioned but we were able to establish a solid foundation to build upon in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully set up a local database where both patients and physicians can log in, put in medical information and view pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that diverse teams can flourish and grow with collaboration and teamwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Circulo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personalized medicine can be expanded into the sports field as well. Pharmacists can also use Circulo to more accurately create dosages based on the availability of patient information. Yelp can also make use of this technology to allow patients to look up nearby local providers and give them reviews based on how well their check ups went.
