                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When discussing of the inspiration within our team several points rose. We all had personal or close circle experience from the difficulties of job-hunting especially from the time when we were younger. So in the solution we&rsquo;ve created something that would have helped us in the past. The difficulties in our personal problem is also seen in bigger scale in our society. Difficulties in having a job causes social difficulties since having a job is an important part of staying away from exclusion. The realization that our concept could make huge social impact and it has actual demand was such a motivating thought.

                    Academic research has also covered this topic and pointed out how the negative emotions affect the willingness to start looking for a job:

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mentori is a platform that supports young people in job-hunting. The core concept is to create positive service that is supportive towards doing and learning which all aims to getting a job. We are taking concrete perspective into job-seeking by breaking the whole process into small steps which both improve strength own recognition and thus enhance ability to seek a job that fits. This perspective makes the whole process more approachable because it makes it clear what to do on a certain point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our service can be roughly divided into three parts:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Activities
                    </strong>
                    The function of the &ldquo;Activities&rdquo; part is to help the users to recognize things that they can utilize in their job applications, even though they are not considered as traditional work experience. There are different categories in the Activities section, and under every category the user can find lists of smaller tasks they can do. Example categories could include &ldquo;creativity&rdquo;, &ldquo; entrepreneurship&rdquo;, &ldquo;hobbies&rdquo;, etc. For example, &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; category would include tasks and ideas like &ldquo;write a blog post&rdquo;, &ldquo;film your own video&rdquo; or &ldquo;take part in a play&rdquo;. By doing these kind of tasks the user will learn useful skills but also notice what kind of topics interest him or her. These tasks function like to-do lists where the user can tick off tasks after completing them. The user can also add their own tasks, which encourages to think what other activities could benefit them in finding a job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Scoreboard
                    </strong>
                    At the moment the job applicant can&rsquo;t really see his or her own development. There is only &ldquo;yes or no&rdquo;, either you worked hard and got the job or you didn&rsquo;t. The scoreboard section is tackling this problem through gamification and visualization so that the user can see his personal development and current status. In order to gain more experience, the user doesn&rsquo;t need to get a job, but they can instead complete tasks in the &ldquo;Activities&rdquo; section. This way there is a constant feeling of progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Job market
                    </strong>
                    Teenagers are desperate for work experience, but they can&rsquo;t really compete against other applicants with a longer working history. They spend hours creating a half empty CV and then get disappointed when all that work seems to be for nothing. This is why our solution includes a job market dedicated for people with almost no work experience. These &ldquo;jobs&rdquo; would include small scale jobs like helping at the local sports club, picking strawberries for one week, participating in a workshop or, for example, TET weeks (A finnish program providing one to three weeks of real work experience). When the applicant finds an interesting job, they can simply click apply. The platform will accept 10 applicants and offer the job for the applicant with the least amount of experience. The applicant doesn&rsquo;t have to create a CV, instead the platform sends the basic information of the applicant straight to the employer. The employer will also receive an online feedback form with two questions: &ldquo;What went well?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What could have gone better?&rdquo;. The answers will go straight to the scoreboard of the applicant, so that she can easily see the feedback and possibly use it when later applying for other jobs.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created mock-ups with Illustrator.
The actual execution of the software could be done by creating the product as a micro service besides KEHA&rsquo;s current digital service model which gives the freedom of technical stack and removes dependencies on each other in some extent. Possible integrations with existing data could be done by API&rsquo;s that aren&rsquo;t dependent on each others development stack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users should be able to access the platform with a native application on the most popular mobile operating systems and through the web browser of their computers.

                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started overwhelmed by the scale of the problems in our given challenge: &ldquo;Hack the job&rdquo; was and a lot of time was spent in trying to find a compact part of the entire process of making unemployed people find their way to the right place to work.

                <p>
                    A possible solution that can either be developed forward or hopefully at least a few workable ideas.

                <h2>
                    Marketing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Target groups of the software are young people ages from 15 to 20 years. The marketing should be primarily targeted to these groups by choosing marketing channels that are near to these people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The media and thus marketing consumed by youngsters is mostly digital, so marketing campaigns should be mostly run on these platforms. Alongside with digital marketing, more traditional channels can be used with some discretion. These include marketing done on public transport, since especially young people are using relatively lot of time in public transport.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides young people, it&rsquo;s important to reach out the officials at schools since they have a considerable impact on helping the students to start their path to working life. The officials can be best reached through official training and by using possible ready made connections between schools and KEHA. By help of these authorities it&rsquo;s easier to get users into the platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The platform also relies on having actual jobs offered on the site, which means that partners who can offer them are also necessary. The partners can be companies but also municipalities, bureaus and possibly even private individuals.
