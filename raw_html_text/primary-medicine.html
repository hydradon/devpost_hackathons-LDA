                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On average, it takes up to 45+ minutes to see a physician at an urgent care clinic &amp; 4 hours to get discharged. For many people, the wait time or misdiagnosing an issue that they think is minor can lead to serious health complications. What if there was a better way to seek help, through a secure telemedicine platform?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows hospitals, urgent care clinics and physicians to easily connect with patients through their mobile devices. Patients are happy because they can receive personalized healthcare at the tap of a button. Doctors are happy because we automate the paper work and they generate more business from patients anywhere.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a modern tech stack that includes Agoras HIPAA compliant video platform, Node.js, MongoDB, Bootstrap, Gulp and Zeit
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out the best data store to use (we decided on mongodb)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building a production ready platform for the telemedicine space
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That their is a real problem within the telemedicine space. Many private practices, urgent care centers and hospitals we talk to want to offer a solution like this but dont have the expertise to build a solution like this in house. Thats where we come in, the power of web RTC &amp; mobile video SDKs is very real!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Continue to build out the platform and onboard partners. We are working on establishing a pilot with a hospital in the East Bay Area!
