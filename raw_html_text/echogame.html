                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We just thought that creating games bring the biggest fun
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Player has to go through map and collect treasures. Unfortunately it is so dark around him that he can rely only on the sound.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using phaser.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    phaser.js and javascript itself
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the features are implemented and with every new one it looks better and better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    phaser.js and javascript - I have never made single project in javascript before. Actually only one of us knew how to work with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EchoGame
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add new levels and increase difficulty. Also soundwaves should look more like waves than just circles.
