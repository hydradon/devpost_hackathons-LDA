                    Inspiration : This was all thanks to Sam's long love story with scratch projects. On a more serious note, this idea came to be when we realized that students like ourselves spend a lot of time commuting and would prefer to listen to their class notes as audio files instead of tiring their eyes in the bumpy Montreal roads.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does : These are two demo versions showing ALI, our mascot guiding the user to convert basic numbers into text and text into sound.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it : Using the public Scratch network and a lot of trial and error, our project is an adaptation through some pre-existing project source codes to create the bigger concept of converting written notes into something the user can listen to.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into : It was really frustrating that two of our teammates left. We had some ideas but our skills were not up to bar. We also fell into a huge loop of updates and software installing with android studio so we eventually had to change the idea again.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of : We managed to work on both projects in a parallel manner with only two members with perseverance.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned : We learned how to use GitHub, Scratch and how to research source codes under a time limit.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ALI-E : We can integrate deep learning so that ALI-E will be able to recognize the user's handwriting more accurately. We can also use an extensive database that will not rely only on letters but on phonetics to create a more fluid speech.
