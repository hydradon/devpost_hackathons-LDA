                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently, I have been trying to learn how to write songs. However, I had some trouble learning the proper chords and scales.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This tool helps highlight the basic scale that is needed to begin songwriting. The major scale. The android app can tell the user which note they are playing, the chord they are playing, and highlight the major scale of that note.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I first began by using a great amount of RectF's to make the white keys, which are red in this piano, and the black keys. The piano responds to touch by using the onTouchEvent command in Android java.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a few issues with the sound playing and after loading the project as a whole multiple times, sometimes the prgram would cooperate in playing a sound.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of myself for coming to my first hackathon, not sleeping and drinking an entire 2 liter bottle of Mountain Dew to stay awake.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When participating in hackathons, don't sleep, as you could miss valuable info and your chance to win prizes.

                <p>
                    I would like to add other scales like the minor scale, diminished scale, and augmented scale to name a few. Then, I would like to know how to incorporate .xml into my code. That would allow for an easy metronome and a few sample songs to play to a certain speed set by time.
