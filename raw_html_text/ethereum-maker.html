                    Ethereum Makers - The Digital Gold Rush And The New Global Dream.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today, we are un-disputably living in the &ldquo;Digital Age Of Gold&rdquo;. Cryptocurrencies, Ethereum Smart Contracts, in particular, have redefined and reshaped the current economy, the Makers Economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ethereum Makers are highly sought after. We are the architects of the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Lower barriers to entry
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All you need to participate in this new economy is an internet connection and a computer with a 
Chrome Browser. You can even do away with the computer and just use a Chromebook which lowers, even more, the barriers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    New Opportunities
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never before in this digital economy has it been possible to program money. Makers, with that particular set of skills, are writing their own tickets to the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not everybody is a developer, but not every developer is a business person as well. As different verticals will need integration with Smart Contracts, there will be a demand for collaboration between technical and non-technical person to build the future of the decentralized world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ethereum Makers are going to be high demand to build Smart Contracts based on specifications from the business world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The New Norm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New millionaires are minted every day. ICOs or initial coin offerings are creating instant millionaires, via essentially smart contracts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Needless to say that, as much wealth si tied to Smart Contracts, there will be a tremendous need for security audits and other smart contract related services.
