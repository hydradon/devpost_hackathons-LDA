                    Every student looks for solutions for their problems in scientific articles. Often however the articles are too sophisticated for his skills/needs. Then the poor student&rsquo;s search continues, reading through piles of articles and scientific mumbo jumbo until he finds what he needs. However it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way&hellip;

                    When a user reads an article and find that the reading difficulty doesn't match their level of comfort, they can use our service to find other articles on the same topic but with a different reading difficulty.
This will be useful for anyone reading articles. Meaning the potential user base is very broad.

                    With python script as main processor for the request on the Node.JS backend.
The script is making API calls to Microsoft Cognitive Services to find the main topics of the text through text analysis. Then through a Bing search it&rsquo;s finding relevant articles and their URLs then again to evaluate each of them in terms of reading difficulty. The results are then parsed to the frontend formatted as a table with clickable links.
