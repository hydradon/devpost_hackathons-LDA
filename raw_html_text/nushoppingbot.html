                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we didnt even know that we could make online payments via telegram, felt like it was a chance to tap into this aspect of the market
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    users can purchase items that we sell through our telebot through stripe. We have decided to set up a online store for NUS student computing club to faciliate with selling our merchandises to the whole faculty. Additionally, we have the events list to inform students of upcoming events and course materials up for sales as well. We hope to increase accessibility of students and reduce manpower and time put into manually selling the merchandise.
