                    . In addition to these patient benefits, physicians-in-training can develop better skills interacting with patients from studying those they see as expert - so-called 'master clinicians.' But what are the elements of communication, patient interaction, and empathy that make these particular physicians 'masters'? Certainly characterizing these traits will make it easier to educate other physicians in like manner. To date, however, the current 'gold standard' research instruments for studying the patient-physician communication involve manually watching full encounter videos and tagging particular conversation points. We would like to bring these types of important analyses into the digital age.

                    Diglossa was built using Angular with a firebase cloudstore database on the back-end as well as hosting via firebase. The app is broken up into discrete angular components which can be dynamically added to produce dashboards which provide meaningful insights into both the speech of health care providers and its intersection with patients. The app is a web app but is written to be as mobile friendly and portable as possible to enable doctors to use the platform either on tablets, phones, or laptop computers.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the principal challenges which we faced is the lack of support for speaker diarization (distinguishing between speakers) in the Web Speech API. In the end, we determined that through noting pauses in speech, changes of speakers could be inferred yet this is an imperfect solution which would need a better long term solution eventually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, our team was particularly challenged with the overall efficiency of the application. While we wanted to add as many features as possible, we quickly found that latency across the app began to reach exorbitant levels with the plethora of features we were adding continuously. As such, we made cuts for efficiency and simplicity to ensure the best user experience possible without the frustration of frequent freezing or lagging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the (though incomplete) product we managed to produce in just a couple days. The dashboard which shows time series data describing the doctor-patient interaction is something we truly feel can improve outcomes for patients across the board. The real time nature of these speech analytics is largely unprecedented in the medical field. This sense that we have somehow made a difference in the medical community in a substantive and unique way is very fulfilling.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Doing this project taught us the complexities of PPC with so much available data yet not many contrived algorithms to fully exploit it to its full potential. We learned a lot about speech analysis and its intricacies in order to produce the best data visualizations possible.

                <p>
                    We would like to improve speaker diarization, get our hands on some real clinical data to train real-world models, and undergo a UI overhaul.
