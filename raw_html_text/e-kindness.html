                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every person has extra/spare belonging which they don't use. We want to encourage them to easily donate them to needy &amp; deserving people with the help of technology.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Donor posts their spare belongings, we collect them and give them to local organizations, who have access to needy &amp;  poor people. We keep tracking the donation and let the donor know about it.

                <p>
                    We built an android prototype app over this weekend, which works exactly as we aim. We have built APIs &amp; server based database using node and MongoDB, respectively.

                <p>
                    E Kindness is based on how to help poor people instead of how we will make money out of it. We made the prototype over this weekend.
