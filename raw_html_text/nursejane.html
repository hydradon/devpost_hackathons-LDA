                <p>
                    One of the most important factors that make a high ranking hospital, is the patient experience. And one of the biggest feedback problems hospitals get, are the anxious, annoying processes of being dispatched. But We have a solution:
                </p>
                <p>
                    NurseJane is a cloud based program that will allow the processing time of a patient to be more efficient, and the patient to have a more calmer, pleasing time waiting to be dispatched, by allowing the patient to have a website where the patient can fill out forms, allowing the paperwork process to be quicker, and giving them real-time updates on the process of dispatchment, so there is no anxiety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NurseJane also grants the nurse that controls the patient information, a website where they can easily edit and input information of the nurse, like a confirmation to be dispatched.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspiration for your submission - We were inspired to do this project because we wanted to learn about cloud based solutions. We thought it would be the best thing to collaborate with partners and make a useful solution.

                    What your submission does -
                </p>
                <p>
                    How you built it - Using Oracle Cloud for web hosting, domain.com (for a cool domain), html, css, javascript, php, and MySQL, a partner worked on the frontend of the website, while two partners worked on the backend PHP, and MySQL for the website. One partner also set up the oracle cloud and combined everything, to make NurseJane
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges that you ran into, and how you overcame them - We had to learn new languages and processes. We also encountered and issue with the server, and MySQLi has been difficult to work with. We used online resources and mentors to overcome our challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that you're proud of - Learning PHP and MySQL in one day, to make or solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for your product? - We are currently correcting errors, and attempting to implement things that will make our solution better in order to fit our agenda.

                    Data input: 1) Data from "Add Patient" to "patients" table (creating rows) - When a new patient is created, the bools (doc_check, safe_home, safe_trans, prescriptions_sent, nurse_breifing, patient_paperwork) need to be made false, and the time_init should be recorded. 2) Data from "Edit Patients" to "patients" table (editing boolenans)

                <p>
                    Data output: 1) Patient list on staff-side (sort by start time) - maybe color-code? - visualization of checklist for edit patient 2) Patient info on Patient Side -Percentage/checklist w/ visualization
