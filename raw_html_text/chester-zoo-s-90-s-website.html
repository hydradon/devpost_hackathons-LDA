                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was great for feeding our nostalgia: dial-up tones, auto-playing music, low-res images and wild backgrounds ruled our inspiration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a 90's theme site for Chester Zoo. We have lots of about us pages, educational info, quizzes and gifs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript. This was great for us, because anything else would have felt too slick, and none of the team members have much experience in web development, so it kept things simple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to find information to help online was hard - we could find plenty of advice to speed our websites load times, but nothing to slow them down!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of it. It's hideous, horrible to navigate and the ultimate nostalgia trip, with cute gifs to boot!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So much, from delegating work amongst a team, to tackling new coding challenges that are new to us as very green developers!
