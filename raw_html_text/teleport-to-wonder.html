                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did a project in school to vary the idea in different forms. I started off with an idea to creatively teach people about the 7 wonders because many of them are ignorant about it. Finally, I ended up making my first VR product, and that too on my most preferred platform the web. I was intrigued by AFrame when I landed at the RealityVirtually Hackathon at MIT Media Lab.
Also, I'm one of the craziest persons you will find about the 7 wonders of the world. I have visited three so far.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This provides a WebVR experience and gives you the impression and feel to study the basic history and understand the new 7 wonders of the world by teleporting you virtually there, with visuals and audio. This can be expanded to rebuild a feel of the ancient 7 wonders of the world as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this with all the basic info that I learned in the first 2 days at the RealityVirtually Hackathon at MIT Media Lab.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to understand the difference in tags with the a-frame semantics and the regular HTML but with a little trial and error, I was able to work around it. With more time, I could add CSS animations, transitions, focussing the clicks on certain areas and also build the 3D models of at least the ancient wonders that do not exist today.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first venture into VR and I'm so happy about it. What makes me glad is that I managed to build this within two days on my own, inside Web, because web is one of my favorite platforms! It's just fun to know that there's something like Aframe out there and I can't wait to dig in more. Also I hope this serves as an inspiration to those who want to build quick VR apps. This is a good start to help children get virtually the real experience so that they can understand stuff better.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just make it! Get down and dirty and just make it, no matter what people say.

                <p>
                    Adding better and focussed interactions, expanding it to the ancient 7 wonders and giving a try to build 3D models with Aframes to replicate the extinct ancient wonders.
