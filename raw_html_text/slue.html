                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So my family and I had gone on a trip to Pairs last summer, Now some quick context about my mom, she loves gardening and she has various species of plants all over the house. When we went to Paris, my mom was very paranoid that the plants were going to die. When we came back, this ended up being true. After seeing this unfold, I wanted to make a simple device that would be able to water my plants when I am not there to do so.

## What it does
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The Slue is a watering system that gets the soil moisture and plant nutrients from the plant and waters them accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the slue by using Arduino to get information from a soil moisture sensor and water the plants using a water pump. We also use the information gathered from the soil moisture sensor to send notifications when the plant is being watered on an app that we made with flutter by uploading it to Asksensors and extracting the data from it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to get the motor to start in the beginning because we did not configure the Arduino properly. We were also having a lot of trouble getting the data from the soil moisture sensor to firebase so we switched to using ask sensor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get the water pump system working and we were able to get the data from the soil moisture into sk sensor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned a lot about Arduino and ask sensor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Slue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make a professional app for Slue and import data to firebase so it is more secure We also want to be able to display real-time data on our application. We also want to make a web application.
