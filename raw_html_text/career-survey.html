                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to help young girls pick out a career! We all know how hard it can be to pick a direction, so we developed this to help some people out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using a simply weighted Python-3 code, it assigns weights to several different career choices depending on your answer choices.

                <p>
                    I had a lot of trouble with tabbing and spacing - Python is really finicky!
