                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The amplitude of mental health problems among students has increased a lot in the last couple of years. Study after study shows that students of today feel higher and higher levels of stress. In a survey made by mtvU Associated Press, 60% of students reported that "severe stress interfered with their ability to complete their schoolwork". Another survey, made by the National College Health Assessment, reported that 46.3% of all undergraduate students felt overwhelmed regarding their academic responsibilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal with this project is to decrease the stress of students and at the same time help them to improve their mental health. We want to make it easier for students to finish their schoolwork on time, and at the same time give them the possibility to do activities that increases their mental health like take walks or workout while doing so.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snap a picture of any text and listen to it! Your textbook would be an excellent choice. Have it read aloud from your phone anywhere you go!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Snap it, hear it, learn it!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end in flutter, which we connected to Google-Firebase. When the user snaps a picture, the picture is uploaded to a storage bucket. Using Firebase Functions, we built a back-end in python which uses Google-vision to extract the text before converting it to audio with Google-WaveNet and storing it in the bucket. The back-end returns a signed URL to the audio, from which the front-end streams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first tried using Firebase ML Kit, which would have eliminated the need for a back-end entirely. ML Kit's capability proved too weak, so we opted instead to use the fully powered cloud versions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One team-member hadn't used Flutter until this Hackathon. Going from that to building our front-end was no easy feat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, none of us had ever been at a Hackathon before so we have learned the whole Hackathon atmosphere. 
Above this, we have learned Flutter + Firebase architecture and workflow, and also how we work as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snap and listen
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add functionality to snap multiple pictures, for example 10 pages from a textbook and have it turned into a mini-audiobook. Improve the front-end, make it more user-friendly and intuitive.
