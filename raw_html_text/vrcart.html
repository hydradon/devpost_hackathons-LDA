                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every day each one of us gets a chance to make a conscious choice to be more environmentally friendly and most of us knowingly let that chance go away. We wanted to make this choice more convenient for everyone so that they can make a difference whilst having fun with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    W3RCart is an environmentally conscious shopping experience which increases the reliability of online shopping with an innovative, and engaging, purchaser platform that is intuitive and gamified.

                <h2>
                    Why VRCart
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, 66.6% of online consumers only purchase online as a supplementary action to their physical purchases. The growth in online grocery shopping is approximately 15% per year and will account for about 12% of the total grocery market purchases by 2020. This reveals that whilst an increasing number of students are making grocery purchases online and they have access to the applications and the tools, the experience is not matured and enriching and rewarding enough for them to properly utilize online channels in their grocery purchases.

                    1) To make a seamless and simple but engaging VR application to make purchases online without ever facing the need to, or the absence of, a physical store. 
2) To gamify and build customers loyalty around our platform, make them invested and aware of greener buying options

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity, VR Tool Kit, Google DayDream and Android Studio.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the whole team had no prior experience with VR development and Unity, we struggled to figure out how to make our inspiration into reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn a lot from this experience and gain a completely different perspective on VR and immersive technology as we got to develop it first hand and come up with something that we are proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned collaboration and failing fast initially. We were able to learn to develop on VR, use Google VR and Unity.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps include gaining traction and building a loyal customer base that fully converts to using VRCart for their grocery purchases and then building networking of referrals from them, alongside constant improvements and additions.
