                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I work in community development locally in the Erb West and Paulander community centers funded through the non for profit Carizon. I have first hand seen the positive impact these community centers have made on the neighborhood and how important it has been in the development of a strong, united community.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app notifies neighbors and provides a calendar view about the events that are occuring at the center in an easy to view.
