                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our math teacher regularly prints out questions to throw into a bag and pulls them out to randomize test/exam reviews. This technique was inspired by a student called Nadine, which is where we got our name from. Though it was a very useful way of reviewing for evaluations, it wasn't shareable with students and it was tedious. We thought it would be easier and more effective to create a digital tool that can do the same thing faster and better. Our goal is to make something functional and have fun while we do it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of now the program simply allows the user to select a PDF file and designate the pages of the PDF they want to show. After displaying the file, the questions displayed can be sectioned off. When the export button is clicked, all the individual sections will be converted to PNG files and saved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python with a GUI library called tkinter
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Library compatibility issues
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning a new library
Creating a high level GUI
Apply the principles of MVC application architecture
appreciate how far we've come in terms of developing desktop apps
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    prepare even more. We planned this hackathon out pretty well but I still had a lot of suprises thrown at me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Nadine's Review?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we want to actually make something functional and useful, we have some quite ambitious prospects for the future of this project.
Here are some in no particular order:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Implement the prototype in our school, many of our teachers have already endorsed the product saying they would use it if we made it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a mobile and web app for further ease of sharing and creating review sets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use AI (OCR) to allow the program to automatically recognize individual questions making the user experience even better.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have separate viewer and creator interfaces and also a better looking UI in general.
                    </li>
                </ol>
