                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Course Registration was coming up in a week and I felt frustrated with the faculty pages of professors not displaying the courses they are currently teaching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of right now, this Android app will display a UT ECE professor's name, image and coursework randomly at the tap of a button. The information will fade away automatically after a couple seconds. This layout is almost similar to a flashcard quiz format, and the flashy, trivia setup encourages an attempt at remembering the information, instinctively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the random display required some form of random number generation. I looked into different ways this randomness could be achieved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing the background and burnt orange layout was exciting to do on Photoshop. I wanted school pride to be an aspect of this app and feel I have accomplished that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to rasterize shapes and combine layers on Photoshop. I also learned some Java syntax which was surprisingly similar to the C programming I was familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Random Professor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Potentially, this app would be expanded to more departments at UT and maybe even more universities. It would be really nice if this app could provide a platform for users to update professor info and maybe even share advice with their fellow colleagues about course rigor. However, this is not necessarily a professor rating app. I intend for this to familiarize students with their professor's interests and research. It would then be more convenient to make classes and schools searchable rather than randomized.
