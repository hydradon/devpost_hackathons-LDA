                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nowadays people have very little time (or so it seems). In addition, bank hours are often inconvenient for those who work full-time. We address these problems by connecting financial advisors to their clients directly via a secure video chat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Verifies user identity using facial recognition.
The user can see their banking dashboard.

                        Schedule appointments with their financial advisor
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Text, voice, and video call with their advisor via the web app
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a basic HTML/javascript/CSS website as a template. We used google firebase to store user images. We used Microsoft Azure to host our site. We used Microsoft face API to analyze faces and verify a users identity against a saved image of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wow, there were lots! We started with an angular application but that didn't go too well. Most APIS were better suited for javascript (not typescript). It was also difficult to write files straight from javascript to google firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks pretty good! At our last hackathon, we had a java gui so this is definitely a step up in terms of UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned javascript and some HTML. Chris learned how to use APIs.
                </p>

                    What's next for McAdvisor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're thinking of pitching it to the big-five (maybe Goldman).
On a more short-term note, adding voice recognition. Take advantage of all firebases functions. Integrate online signatures for forms. The list goes on and on!
