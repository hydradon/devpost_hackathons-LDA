                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A common barrier that people face to developing a productive mindset is lack of self-discipline. Our team feels that this is an issue that can _ and should _ be addressed.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app tackles the issue of self-discipline by setting short-term goals for the user which will lead them towards a more productive path. This is done by forcing the user to reflect on their current habits, and then decide which habits they would like to strengthen and which habits they would like to break. The app then tracks their daily progress as they work towards this goal, and provides continuous feedback to let them visualize how they are doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using android studio, we created a series of XML files that are linked together in a logical flow for an optimal user experience. The back-end is done using Java to keep track of all the user inputs, and provide daily feedback to the user based on their progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -linking pages together when a button is pressed
-outputting text based on inputs from the user
-keeping track of how many times the user inputs a new value
-stopping the program from crashing when incorrect values are inputted
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -successfully updating an array of numbers each time the user submits an input
-forcing the user to input a number by changing the keyboard to a numpad
-creating an icon for the app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of writing and testing an android app. Additionally, we gained strong skills in collaboration to develop code together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Habit Haven
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main opportunities to improve the app are as follows:
-Removing the option to track your progress (hide the button) until the user has created a habit
-Improvements in user feedback (ex. graphical representation of the data collected)
-An Improved prompting to select a habit (ie. have the app choose options from a list and suggest those to the user)
-A notification system that would prompt the user each day to input their hours for the day
