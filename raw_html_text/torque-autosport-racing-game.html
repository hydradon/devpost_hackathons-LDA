                <p>
                    Many games today include these new hypercars but they forget that customization and tuning etc 
Current NFS Rivals is an example it includes hypercars but no street cars and barely any customization.
So Torque - Autosport is doing the exact opposite street cars with street racing and big customization and tuning like Forza Game Series
                </p>
