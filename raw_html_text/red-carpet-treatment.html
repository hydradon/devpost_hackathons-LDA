                    Most Facebook Group members are disengaged. Anecdotally, the top 80% of posts consists of 20% of the members, while the majority may never return.

                    Building a strong community requires immediate access to

                        findable + excellent content, not just exposure to the most recent posts.

                <p>
                    From our community leaders, we&rsquo;ve heard
                    <strong>
                        many members miss important posts

                    <strong>
                        admins find it difficult the disseminate the most important content.

                    Imagine every group you join is an inviting home that rolls out a red carpet for you. The host personally welcomes you to the family, serves you the best content, and shows you to the house's unique amenities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interest groups can now give their members the royal welcome, surfacing curated content, available with a search function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you joined the group "Wellness Mama - Official" with 11K members, you can view week by week top posts, as well as subject-matter posts that you&rsquo;re looking for (#advice, #emergency, #ask).

                <p>
                    We had a stylish design for home, but were constrained by our team size and time limit. It could be very time consuming to get all types of feeds supported completely (status type, single attachment, multi attachment, media type)

                    This was a one-engineer show. Thanks to Louis (Kwan), we came up with a working prototype &amp; a whole user story in less than 14 hours.

                        Member-only sponsors (eg 10% off at Trader Joes, free first Barre3 class, BOGO at Gymboree for &ldquo;Wellness Mama&rdquo;), allowing a triple symbiosis. Users will feel a strong identity to their new home, Facebooks Groups will attract and retain more users, and sponsors have a high-conversion acquisition channel.
