                    The inspiration for this project was wanting to connect more with my local community to take action and improve the overall quality of life. Promoting a more eco-friendly way of living will potentially motivate future generations to care more about our earth. We believe that the process of rebuilding some of the damage that has occurred, can begin through a more conscientious way of life. our motivation is a large scale change in the ways of living that will benefit everybody. through our web based app, donations that are made will be used for charity and actually investing in the green technologies that everyone is interested in. With an awarness to the importance of volunteer work, teenagers within the community will be able to accomplish volunteer work that can be added to their resumes, that afternoon.
