                    My inspiration comes from other multiplayer games. The other players block your path and accidently kill you, so I decided to make a game where blocking is the main component.

                    In this game, each opponent has to get to the opposing side, and can hit each other on the way there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started by creating a &lsquo;skeleton&lsquo; with a variable that controls what screen you&lsquo;re on. I then started off with the mandatory mechanics, then drifted into more technical parts.

                    I ran into a challenge when randomizing the powerup each player can get as I had too many if statements and the game was crashing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&lsquo;m proud of the part of the game where the opponents bounce of of each other, as it was cool to see how I created an interactive program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned many small things that will help me in later hackathons, such as proper randomization, and many good debugging techniques.

                    I was planning to make multiple maps where the players can&lsquo;t simply go from one side of the map to the other, but I ran out of time.
