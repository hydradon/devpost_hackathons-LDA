                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Braulio and Lil Andrea have never hacked, Vicky and Azael love to hack. It's dangerous to be alone! Take Alexa!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa gives you inspirational quotes, funny stories, quirky jokes to cheer you up. But Alexa is really concerned about you, if you keep rejecting her positive gestures, she contacts your mom/your best friend/etc in hopes of making u smile :-)

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python and Flask master race
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually understanding Alexa. The longest part of the project was setting her up and creating a more interactive dialog
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using twilio! And we like the engineering jokes we included
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vicky: I love Alexa and coffee even more
Azael: I learned about Amazon's Alexa and improved my programming skills
Braulio: I realized how frustrating and rewarding coding and CS are. Hats off. 
Lil Andrea: I found out that devices can do a lot more than what they come with. What CS can make them do is quite exciting
                </p>

                    What's next for cheeriOS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Phone calls, more complex interaction...also we wish she sang...she'd have a great singing voice, also IBM Watson Tone Analyzer integration
                </p>
