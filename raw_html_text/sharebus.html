                    A demand on service that offer a door to door journey and complement the actual transport network in Barcelona. This service is available in the Barcelona Metropolitan Transport APP and eliminate the disadvanteges of the old on-demand services due to the restrictions that we apply when we are going to book the travel.

                    The city is a living organism, a dynamic system full with flows in ever direction, is a knowledge plataform that allows the materialization of exchanges.
The existing public transport network, as a rigid structure, is unable to satisfy the constant demand of a dynamic society.
In this framework we can not provide a rigide solution to a dynamic question.
We propose a flexible public system that works as a complement to the existent public net unifing the paths that currently are overlapping them-self in individual private vehicules.
Developing an app that is based on an algorithm that provides a shared bus service through the coincidence of origins and destinations that overlap unifying paths. T
We propouse a new way to move us. This is a demand-on service that offer a door to door journey and complement the actual transport network in Barcelona. This service is available in the Barcelona Metropolitan Transport APP and eliminate the disadvanteges of the old on-demand services due to the restrictions that we apply when we are going to book the travel.
