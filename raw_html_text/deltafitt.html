                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea to promote fitness using a point-based system called the Fitness Score that compares your fitness rating to your friends comes from a concept used in the Chinese government to make people want to behave a certain way. This is accomplished by making the application send messages to provide the user with shame for slacking off while a friend excels, or guilt for not helping a friend maintain their activities. The messages themselves range from sassy, Gordan Ramsey-like insults to quirky compliments and references that makes accomplishing fitness goals funny. The idea being that if people can have a good laugh while making progress, or laugh getting called out for not doing anything, they will enjoy achieving their fitness goals more.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project stores input from the user based on their activities, including information such as their location, their Netflix usage, and any other helpful information that can be found in user's linked account. The user can also input their exercises into the app manually. The user may edit their goals on the app page, and view their daily, weekly and monthly progress. Users are required to link an email, Facebook or Twitter. It will add friends who have their accounts linked to the app as friends on the app automatically, and will provide the option to search friends in the app itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app increases the user's Fitness Score whenever they make progress towards their goals, and decreases it when the user is inactive, or tries to lie to the app when adding their exercises. The Fitness Score will also adjust based on data collected on the user from the system. For example, if the user tries to input today's physical activity while they have actually spent the past 2 days binging a series on a Netflix account linked to the same accounts that app is linked to, the system will instead decrement the user's fitness points and display a funny insult. Messages from the app will be displayed regularly on the device as the user's Fitness Score changes.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was meant to have been built with Android Studio, but due to unforeseen circumstances I was unable to complete this for the reasons listed below in challenges.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was initially a team project, however all of my teammates abandoned on the second day, and took important code that they didn't post to any group chat or repo with them.

                <p>
                    I'm mostly just proud that I was able to submit an unfinished project despite being solo.

                    After the presentation, I may build it all again from scratch one day in the future.
