                    GIGANTIC project to combat information overload on the internet. It requires a lot of motivation to educate oneself through the internet.

                    Don Norman (author of Design of Everyday Things) would identify this as a design flaw arguing that the internet as a product does a bad job motivating users to educate themselves. With the ridiculous wealth of content on the internet, this is understandable.

                    Discovery is my research project, and Discover Black is only a part of it. Here I parse wikipedia to help users narrow their topic of interest. Wikipedia's ontology has a nice layout for this, and I was able to provide information to users pretty well. There's one bug in it that would require a decently big refactor though and that's doing a ridic amount of string parsing lol I'll probably have to go this route to finish the project for the end of the term.

                    Ignoring that, Discovery is decently well on it's way - I want to add a resource recommender (like page rank but better) and a user profiling is needed. Front end also.
