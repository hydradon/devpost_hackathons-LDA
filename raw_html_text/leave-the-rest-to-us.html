                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One health problem almost all college students face is sleep deprivation; with school, work, and everything in between, it's often hard to squeeze in those much-needed hours of shut-eye. We wanted to build a simple utility to help students manage their time and improve their sleep schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Leave the Rest to Us
                    </strong>
                    first asks for basic user information: age, stress level, and other attributes in order to determine the ideal amount of sleep for the user. Then it takes in both the user's schedule as well as a list of tasks to get done throughout the week as input, and fills in the gaps in their current weekly schedule to ensure they have enough time to get their work done while getting adequate sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app around Node.js and developed unique algorithms in order to determine ideal sleep level and to generate an optimal schedule based on the user's needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it very challenging to come up with a working algorithm to generate a reasonable schedule that would be valid and useful for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented a great deal of thought and logic in developing our algorithms (as well as our debugging techniques) and also had to come up with pretty creative solutions to represent our data visually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing algorithms is very difficult and requires a lot of patience and thinking.

                <p>
                    Location support, task prioritizing/splitting, mobile app porting, and algorithm optimizations.
