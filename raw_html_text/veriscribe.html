                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were motivated by the sheer number of cases in America where prescriptions go wrong. People re-use their old prescriptions by switching to a different ID, allowing for drug abuse issues. Other people have the prescription misinterpreted by the doctor or the pharmacist who fills the prescription. These various mistakes can be extremely costly in terms of human well-being.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a web app that keeps track of all your prescriptions so far. Prescriptions can be generated by a doctor in a clean, easy-to-read format preventing any mistakes in interpretation. Additionally, by requiring DocuSign signatures from the doctor and the pharmacist filling the prescription, we prevent abuse of the platform. Once both the doctor has signed the prescription and the pharmacist has signed acknowledging the fact that they filled the prescription, it is considered to be closed and can no longer be used to obtain more medications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this whole app using React as our main backbone. We also worked on integrating the DocuSign API into this product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some difficulties figuring out the DocuSign API and we tried to get help from the DocuSign team members at their booth, however, we were unable to find them. We figured out how to mock the DocuSign user experience in our frontend so that potential users can clearly see how it would work in our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our members learning new technologies, such as React.js, as well as the overall clean look and potential impact that this project could deliver to millions of Americans relying on prescriptions for critical medicine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to successfully drive the product conceptualization and launch process within a small, agile team. Most importantly, we learned how to quickly identify what is actually important to users and focus on executing to attain those goals.
                </p>

                    What's next for Veriscribe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue working on DocuSign integration, hopefully in collaboration with DocuSign themselves, and work on delivering this as an actual product that can be used in hospitals and clinics nationwide.
