                </h1>
                <p>
                    Inpired by ImaginBank and Skyscanner challenges, we decided that creating a piggy bank that allows us to collect funds that will be destinated to travel was an interesting approach. To make the task easier, the process is done by a Bot empowered with NLP (Luis AI) that maximices the understanding capability of the ChatBot.

                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We have created this chatbot with microsoft bot framework for the bot itself, node.js to manage skyscanner API calls and process them to facilitate Bot's data.
To make the bot "smarter" and allow the user to go faster throught the process we allow the user to be able to have a normal conversation with the bot and we'll just detect which fields are filled during the conversation process. This is done thanks to Luis.ai and the training process that we've done.
To make appear images in the cards, we've done API calls to flickr to take out images related with the country we were interested in.
All this application is built in a heroku.

                    Flight advisor is just a use case of what ImagineBank can do with a chatbot, this application could be extended by adding more functionalities or simply by improving the ChatBot experience.
