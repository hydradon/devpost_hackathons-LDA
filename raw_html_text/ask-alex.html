                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed alexa has a number of shortcomings. So we as developers decided to do something about it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa is great but she's not perfect. She only has a group of developers updating what she has an answer for at any given time so we built a community of people that can update what she knows instantaneously without having to be a developer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon's Lambda servers so that we could excecute the functions remotely. We also used node.js for scripting among other things. We also built the website with html, css, and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Language processing, making the connection between the website and alexa's database etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built and evergrowing personal assistant that is frankly smarter than Alexa itself. We also did all this while working at a nearby starbucks because Ruoxi's computer wasn't connecting to the given wifi and myself (Jeremiah) working with a chromebook and a phone for coding (I used sourcelair to code online once my chromebook ran out of charge).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop for the amazon echo in entirety. Before this we had no knowledge of anything echo related.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ask Alex
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on continuing this more and more, forming a company in the process, because we believe in its future.Hopefully if we are successful Alexa's will constantly become more advanced human-like.
