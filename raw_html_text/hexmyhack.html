                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During Athena Hacks, we had trouble connecting our Microsoft Kinect to our Surface Board. After trying multiple Kinects, it still came with no luck. At that moment, we told ourselves we just had bad luck. We wish we could have known earlier about the hardware defects or had the opportunity to share our AthenaHacks experience as we saw other teams grueling ahead in their project ideas. Then came the idea "Hex my Hack"! Originally stemming from the FML and My Life is Desi stories we read for comedy, we thought it would be fun to read other people's tragic and LOL stories from hackathons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hex My Hack allows people to share their experiences of attending hackathons by rating the event. The criteria for rating include: how organized the event was, the type of food, the giveaways, which companies attended, how helpful the companies were, whether there was a code of conduct.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    We are beginners in HTML &amp; CSS, and we had trouble figuring out how to store data for reviews.

                <p>
                    We have a skeleton for our HexMyHack website.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use local storage to store user input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HexMyHack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue working on this after the hackathon is over. This will be a fun Spring Quarter Project for us and we plan to have a better and stronger server in which we can actually search all hackathons on.
