                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To succeed and help change the world by gearing it towards a better place
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes an individual's finger print and stores any information they enter, into the address of their fingerprint
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uncompleted when compared to its' full potential, the program provided is made with java and selenium
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding an algorithm that would be able to log into any desired website provided with the correct log in information and implementing fingerprint recognition
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The new things I've learned from creating this program, such as learning the extension of selenium and being capable of programming java to be able to open a web browser and log into websites, such as Facebook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The extended possibilities when using extensions. My java and programming skills have also improved through this whole session
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OneTouch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Actually getting a fingerprint scanner and implementing the program. OneTouch will store personal user information, such as annual salary or income, social security, etc. In the long - run, OneTouch will replace the signing of legal documents with fingerprints. An example is purchasing a house or a car; instead of signing a lot of papers and bringing in a multiple documents for proof, OneTouch will pull up all the required information through a fingerprint. This will save time, prevent fraud and identity theft, and make managing your personal information a lot easier. The innovation of OneTouch is exactly where the future is heading, and with OneTouch, we can build and get to that future even faster.
