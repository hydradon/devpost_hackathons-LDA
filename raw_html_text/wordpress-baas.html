                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you think about it, managing Wordpress content within a mobile/desktop application is huge. It opens up a ton of possibilities for content creators and consumers alike. Content creators might begin to see a new and better crop of mobile/desktop blogging clients that allow them to create blog posts and more in unique environments that could never be built in the backend of WordPress itself. Likewise, there could be whole new content experiences built on the web or mobile apps using programs that function completely differently than WordPress but that get its content from a WordPress site.
