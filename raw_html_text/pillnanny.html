                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all a forgetful bunch, and we are all passionate about healthcare and self-care so Pillnanny was a natural intersection of the two! And we decided to continue with this project because we thought it was a smart, fun, and effective solution to the big, but often overlooked, problem of medication noncompliance that&rsquo;s plaguing the US.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is part hardware, part software where we designed a smart pillbox that docks to a hub that smartly distributes multiple medications to the pillbox. It also connects to an app on your phone where you can view a quick list of all your medications, add medications, add caregivers, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardware is a first prototype currently rendered using TinkerCAD where we did research on sensors to integrate. We built the app using React Native for front-end, and firebase, python, flask, and jquery for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In general: using new tools and running out of time! 
Specifically: we ran into challenges using Firebase&mdash;although we had created POST and GET methods to query the US National Library of Medicine of API, we were unable to upload these results to our database. Additionally, we worked on integrating text recognition onto our frontend but were unable to enable Camera permissions for the platform we were using.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all used some cool tools that we've never used before or had little experience with but learned to love now- like Figma for design of the app, Expo for app development, Firebase for our database, and Tinkercad for the design of the pillbox.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal about the gravity of the problem of medication noncompliance, or nonadherence. Technically, we learned to share knowledge on tools we weren&rsquo;t familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pillnanny
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technical goals: Text recognition of pill labels for easy adding of pills, easy upload of pills from doctors, and interactions by using ML and AI to survey how people feel after taking their medications. 
Broad goals: Including education about the contents, side-effects, and other details about their medication
