                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people have questions about where their food comes from, and how it is produced. We wanted to create a platform for consumers to easily access information directly from the farmer. Our web interface,
                    <em>
                        Foodify
                    </em>
                    , will help build a bridge between farmers and consumers to foster consumer trust in food. By using blockchain, we aim to hold food retailers accountable for flaws in their sustainability practices and absolve middlemen such as Cargill from responsibility for misinformation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Foodify takes information from a farmer's IoT device and stores it on a blockchain. Consumers are then able to identify their food item and can trace the certification status back to the farm. For example, a salmon supplier can register their product onto the blockchain. When a consumer searches the product ID, they will know that their salmon is Alaskan and wild-caught.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Foodify using the Flask micro web framework (written in Python) to handle the server-side processes. Using HTML forms and Flask requests, we created a simple website for Farmers to submit data and Consumers to search data. We store the information on a simple homemade blockchain.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Original idea was to use machine learning to predict shrimp disease. We couldn't find sufficient data to accomplish this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Originally attempted using Hyperledger Sawtooth supply chain implementation, but ran into a bug in the current release.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                <h2>
                    What's next for Foodify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A wider range of categories for product registration, implement QR/barcodes, allow consumers to easily and beautifully trace the source of all components of a food item. The future of Foodify could be ingredient tracking, how the meat was slaughtered and when.
