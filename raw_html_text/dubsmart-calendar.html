                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the idea of recovering the many hours of "lost time" we all have each day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DUBSmart Calendar keeps a log of tasks you want to complete, and finds the optimal time interval to complete each one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Calendar API to pull calendar data and find openings where our service can automatically schedule tasks you want to complete.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Installing maven and setting up our development environment were a major challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that our service is capable of handling recurring events, having events show up in the earliest time interval, and most importantly, accounting for sleep hours and planning ahead of time (rather than on the spot).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained familiarity with React and found the best package managers for our project.  We also learned about working together in real time on a large CS project - this was new to most of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DUBSmart Calendar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In future releases, we would like to use machine learning to analyze users' time preferences for recurring events and use location services to prioritize scheduling.
