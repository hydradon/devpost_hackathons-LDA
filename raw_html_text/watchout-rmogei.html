                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During emergencies like snow storms or hurricanes, I would go to Mcdonalds to only find out that they are closed. Another step forward, what if near by power is out or a tree is fallen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User's can report open or closed near by so I know where I can find food to eat. User's also can make incidents if near by activates like fallen trees, we should be aware of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We used GitHub for team collaboration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time is the most challenging process we ran into. Another challenge is vetting the system to make sure false incidents are not reported.
