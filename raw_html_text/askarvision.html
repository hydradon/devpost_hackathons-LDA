                    AskarVision will track your eye movements and find where you are looking at on your computer screen.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Python using OpenFace and Tensorflow. OpenFace analyzes pictures of the user that are taken whenever the mouse is clicked. The user is typically looking at the mouse cursor when they click, so we use this method to gather the training data. We put it through Tensorflow which created a useable model for predicting where the user is looking on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting everything set up took a long time, and Tensorflow was very difficult to work with. It took a lot of trial and error.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually got a working classifier from Tensorflow by the end. It was rudimentary, but it has a lot of potential to be improved greatly in the future.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tensorflow is hard.
