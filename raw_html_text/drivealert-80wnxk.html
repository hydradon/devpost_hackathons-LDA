                <p>
                    No one knows the exact moment sleep comes over their bodies. Any driver from commercial vehicles, to late night shift workers, and drivers with untreated sleep disorders are susceptible to drowsy driving. It is estimated that 1 in 25 drivers have fallen asleep while driving in the last 30 days, and the

                        National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates drowsy driving is responsible for 90,000 crashes, 44,000 injuries, and 795 deaths
                    </a>
                    . There are up to 6,000 fatal crashes due to drowsy driving each year. DriveAlert was developed with the intention to decrease these numbers and save more lives.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once a driver opens the mobile application, our application tracks their eye movements. When the user presses the "Start" button, and their eyes are closed for more than three seconds, the "Alert" page opens and an alarm rings, waking up the driver. If the driver is awake, the screen is green to indicate they've started.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built DriveAlert with XCode using the language Swift. The face tracking was completed with an ARKit. All the designs related to UI were mocked up in Photoshop CC and added to the application using the storyboard. We used colour theory to choose colours that made the user more awake and alert, instead of calming and peaceful colours to put them to sleep.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up and calibrating the ARKit was the most difficult aspect of this project. Once we were able to configure the face tracking with the ARKit, we were extremely proud of our project.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned multiple different techniques in the 12-hour time period, including ARKit and iOS development, which helped us develop DriveAlert.
                </p>

                    What's next for DriveAlert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we see DriveAlert being implemented into taxi applications (i.e. Uber, Lyft, etc.) to ensure drivers who are working late in the night can track their rides as well as stay awake. We also hope to integrate more custom settings for preferred colours and alarm sounds.
