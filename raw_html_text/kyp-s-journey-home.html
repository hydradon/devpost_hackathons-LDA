                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to
                    <strong>
                        push the limits of digital media
                    </strong>
                    . Given the accessibility and flexibility of web technology, we thought it'd be a great story telling medium; especially considering other great interactive stories like
                    <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/theboat/" rel="nofollow">
                        "The Boat"
                    </a>
                    and the work done by the NYU-ITP program.
Additionally, the aesthetics of the story was inspired by the retro 8-bit style games. Not only would the stylistic constraint be a new challenge for our designer, but it would also add some more points of interest to our project.

                <p>
                    We follow Kyp's journey from getting stranded on earth, to reuniting with his family.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js, React.js. 
Adobe Illustrator and Sketch was used for creating the various character and background assets and laying out the basic prototype.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with an idea for our interactive story was our biggest initial challenge. We weren't entirely sure of which direction/tone we wanted our final project to have. By discussing the various story options we had, our team was able to reach a consensus. 
Later on, we found that designing all the needed assets took much longer than anticipated. We under estimated how much assets a "complete" interactive story would need.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the smoothness of the story and transitions. Additionally, the assets reflected our retro 8-bit successfully.
