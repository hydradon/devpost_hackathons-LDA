                    Slogan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Action on Distraction.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a project that we built previously at another hackathon that we went to. We realized that we could create another version of it that was much more effective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It notifies your friends if you have any when you go on distracting websites so they can shame you for wasting time. This way, you will be really motivated to not waste time in the future so that your friends do not shame you in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Script to send the email which notified someone's friends when they were wasting time. We used PHP for the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to figure out how we were supposed to notify a user's friends that they were wasting time. We originally wanted to make a Discord bot but we were able to use Google Script to send an email via Gmail instead, which was more practical.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to create something that could be used in the real world by helping people manage their time. This will allow people to be more productive, which would push society forward.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Google Script to send an email via Gmail.

                    What's next for DistrAction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to continue this project and make improvements upon it. Being very useful, it can help people in the real world, which is what we would like to do. We would make it more user friendly and fix a lot of the bugs that are present in it.
