README file describing contents of proposed application:
Project name:       Cruz Repairs
Mission Statement:  Cruz Repairs will help create a network of people which will
enable clients and service providers to interact. This will 
revolutionize the way people hire/ are hired. 
Issues addressed:   People who need to hire a repair person often do not know who 
or where to hire these people. This network would provide the
client with a list of nearby repair service providers who 
provided their resume. This is a unique feature: craigslist,
for instance, provides people with a site where people can 
put up their ads, yet the site leaves the client in the dark
about the person&rsquo;s qualifications. By creating this network, 
we are also enabling people with specific skills to enter a 
pool of resumes from which clients (of our app looking to           hire someone) will be able to browse and hire.
Plan:
The app/company is only providing the network for people to 
interact. The app/company is not held liable for any person 
hired or any person who hires someone. It is a space similar 
to how Facebook is modeled: Facebook is not technically 
liable for anyone who meets someone on Facebook and later is            harmed. Our app is just the people&rsquo;s means of communication.
Actual Implementation:
The basic functionalities were set up. It is a rough 
prototype of what the app will look like. It currently has 
seven screens.
