                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a few teammates' love of the Disney movie Frozen, and wanted to make something like it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snow Power Fight is a 2-player game where players throw snowballs at one another, and use ice shields to block throws. The first person who gets hit 3 times loses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using Myos to control where the hand is on the screen, and to control when snowballs and ice shields are created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because two of our three team members are beginners, we spent most of the beginning of HackTJ learning some programming basics. We ran short on time towards the end, and had to do most of our work at the last minute.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to both learn and teach so much. All of us feel like our knowledge and skills have improved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code with Myos and incorporate their data into our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snow power Fight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had time, we would've liked to have used the Oculus Rift to make the snowball fight 3D. That could be one of our next steps in improving our game.
