                <p>
                    Our Proposal contains 3 main steps divided on the level of Urgency:
                </p>
                <p>
                    First Problem: Clients are using the same License on different Computers. 
Second Problem:  Lose of customers after the first contact between the Broker and the Truck Company
                </p>
                <p>
                    Immediate solution.
                    <br>
                    Automation of Anomalies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Create a Program that takes all the previous and current information about users behaviors (logins, transaction amounts, IP addresses)  from all the available databases, consolidating the data and apply different rules to automatically prompt Transcore Staff, about suspicious activity.  Some examples of these rules are:
 -The volume of transactions v/s number of licenses. 
 -Times of logins from the same license (credentials). 
-IP addresses changes, on a defined interval. 
This upgrade is going to directly diminish the amount of labor and resources used by TransCore.

                <p>
                    Short Term Solution. 
Software Unique Identifier Authentication
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Short Term, we suggest implementing an Open Source Software (free), called UUID &ldquo;Universal Unique Identification&rdquo;, this is a software that creates a unique Key on installation, attached to the computer where the software is installed. This implementation allows TransCore&rsquo;s License to only be used once a specific computer, also it gives TransCore the option to choose between selling a license that imposes the user to buy one license for each computer, or on the other hand, to sell a license that allow more than one user at the same time &ldquo;With a higher fee&rdquo; .  By using this method TransCore is also going to be able to check if one license is trying to be accessed at the same time and log out the other session first. This also decreases the number of calls for &ldquo;Blocked IP`s&rdquo;. 
Long Term Solution.
Transaction-Based Business Model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We propose changing the way we see licenses and move towards a Pay-Per-Transaction model.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Benefits
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                No license needed, just a membership (monthly fee).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                No need to worry about the location where the license is being used
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A small customer is going to pay only for the number of transactions performed.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        A big customer is going to pay more at first (creating more revenue) but has access to more functionality.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                No IP or authentication needed. 
How membership works: Depending on TransCore numbers, there should be a number for the minimum to pay for small companies and a max amount for big companies (to keep them as a customer by not making them pay too much).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Problem: Maintaining a customer after the first contact between broker and driver.   Membership level
                </p>
                <p>
                    -Over a number of transactions (or higher membership fee ) grants access to -Gps location of the fleet running with their frights -Advertising model for Brokers and Truck Companies, ( after reviewing of behavior and higher fees, brokers or truck companies are going to be shown first on the list when searched)
                </p>
                <p>
                    New Feature Driver Without truck  is added: - Driver without truck mode, Truck companies with extra trucks can rent their trucks to available drivers.
                    <br>
                    Transcore owns a very large amount of data related to trucks that can be used as Big Data. Statistical information could be sold to potential partners like &ldquo;Firestone&rdquo; in exchange for good and positioned advertisement on the Transcore brand.
