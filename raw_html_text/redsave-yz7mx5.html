                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to challenge ourselves with a platform we aren&rsquo;t extremely familiar with, but we also aimed to make the hack worthwhile and have at least some potential for society as a whole.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application is mainly used by the layperson who would be in a natural disaster or other hazardous situation. At the user&rsquo;s discretion, the app collects medical records such as weight, height, and special conditions and pairs them with a last-known GPS location and a picture of the user. If the user is trapped or in danger after the natural disaster, the app will make a single file with all of this information so first responders can rescue civilians faster with this important information. Because this is a bluetooth messaging system, internet and cellular reception is not needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app with the Xcode development environment and the programming language swift, which we more or less learned on the way. We mainly utilized apple&rsquo;s airdrop for communication because it does not require internet or cellular reception.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, we were rather unfamiliar with swift and the limitations of it. Eventually we were able to produce an app with this, however, it did not go exactly as planned
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are both proud we learned some of the nuances of swift and developed an application which has the potential to save lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that arguably the most important part of a hackathon is to have fun. No matter how daunting a challenge can be, the supportive community are always willing to teach and nourish one&rsquo;s curiosity and creativity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RedSave
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will develop the application further and streamline the experience. Regardless if this application would gain traction, the opportunity to learn app development and express oneself is an excellent benefit. For the future, we are planning to use the RedSave Clientele to daisy chain the current process we have to allow more people to be put into contact with the distressed.
