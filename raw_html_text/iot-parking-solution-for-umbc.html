                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parking at UMBC can be time-consuming, given my personal experience I would estimate parking to take 15-40 minutes if everything is near capacity. This is a waste of time that increases emissions while wasting student's gas; a solution to optimize this is vital.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Project Proposal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to make a solution that will optimize people's time and reduce emissions by optimizing the parking flow at UMBC.  I am proposing a system that will track how many spots are available in which parking lots. So that when students drive into UMBC expecting to find a parking spot in a reasonable time, in the best possible location, they know exactly where to go.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How are we going to track what spots are available?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Using pneumatic vehicle counters on every parking lot entrance/exit. These
vehicle counters will be able to collect...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Direction of Travel (in or out of the parking lot)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Speed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The distance between vehicles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The length of each vehicle
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    per vehicle. When this data is collected over a substantial period of time
it can be used to make infrastructure improvements, view seasonal trends,
improve traffic flows, and much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While all this data can be collected optionally, the only thing we really
care about for this application is the direction of travel for each car.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How will this data be transferred from the parking lot into the cloud?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Using Symphony Link from Link Labs. Symphony Link is a wireless solution for
enterprise and industrial customers who need to securely connect their IoT
devices to the cloud. Symphony Link is optimized for low power and wide range
which makes it a great candidate for this project.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    RXR / RLP Communication Modules
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Each parking sensor device will need a Link Labs RXR or RLP Communication Module
which can connect to the Link Labs Gateway.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Gateway
                </h4>
                <p>
                    This powerful device manages security, uplink and downlink, and much advanced low power,
wide-area (LPWA) features only available with Symphony Link. For data backhaul, the gateway 
features ethernet, WiFi, 3G cellular, or 4G LTE.
The Link Labs Gateway should be installed on one of the two cellular towers that
are registered to the University of Maryland: Baltimore County. This would give
the Gateway a great enough range to cover the entire campus. Although more gateways
might need to be installed if capacity is too great (more than a hundred modules
connected to one gateway).
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How will students view this data from the cloud?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Once we get the data to the cloud, it can go anywhere we want it to go. While
most people would make this a "Parking App", I think that is problematic. We
should not encourage students to drive while looking at their phone. This is not
a "hands-free" app and will need to be looked at in the car. An app is not the
answer to this question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We should install Symphony connected signs that show up-to-date numbers for the
cars that are in each lot. These signs need to be in strategic locations (such as
the UMBC entrances and in front of the Lots, etc.) that can be discussed and modified
at a later date with more specifics. These signs will display a table of the selected
lots and how many available spaces it has.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The display signs will use the same RXR/RLP Communication Modules to connect to the
Symphony Network.

                    The Simulated Proposal in Action
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this Hackathon, I created a simulation of my design proposal to convey a better understanding of how this system will work. I did this by creating a "Sign Display Server" and "Parking Sensor Client(s)" that would simulate how a large-scale deployment of this project would look when developed and deployed. Once the "Sign Display Server" is executed, it will accept an unlimited amount of connections from "Parking Sensor Clients". Each parking sensor client has the ability to simulate either a "Car Leaving Event" or a "Car Entering Event" in both manual and automated ways. All of the data is then collected, combined, and displayed to the user via the "Sign Display Server". Design Diagrams can be found below.
                </p>

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Using python, I used the multiprocessing connection libraries along with many many threads to create this simple server-client model. Design Diagrams can be found below.

                    In order to simulate the Symphony Link network, I turned what would be the Display Sign Device into a server that the parking sensors instantly connect to. This connection can be seen as the direct replacement for the much more complex Symphony Link system.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Networking. I originally wanted to make a demo using our Symphony Link Gateways, Modules, and Backend; but I could not connect to our backends through the network's firewall. So since the connection to our backend was blocked by the network, I would have had to get a gateway with a cellular connection which I did not have access to as of implementing this project. So I improvised by creating a complete simulation.
