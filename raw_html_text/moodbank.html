                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It all started with our interest in Envel's challenge to come up with an interesting savings algorithm, as well as in working with Google Cloud's NLP API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web-app aims to determine what percentage of the user's net income should go into their savings by analyzing their mood through several processes, including open-ended questions, random check with Twitter API, and weather mood measure. Ultimately, the user should know what amount they should save: the more emotionally negative they are, the more they can spend (the less they need to save) on something that will make them happy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using Flask, MongoDB, Dark Sky API, Google Cloud's NLP API, and Twitter API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mostly had problems with coming up with an appropriate algorithm for finding what percentage of the user's net income should go into their savings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of coming up with such an interesting, interdisciplinary idea/algorithm, and of being able to work with an NLP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides learning how to use an NLP, we learned how to combine what we have learned in the past to build a multidisciplinary project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MoodBank
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We look forward to coming up with more endgoals for the project, including more options for a more varied population (as we know not everyone feels happier when they spend instead of saving.
