                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The number of young adult voters has hit all time lows. Students are not representing themselves, and it is hard to vote when you aren't in the city where you registered to vote. It's especially hard to vote when you are not registered at all. So we made a website with information on absentee voting, early voting, and voter registration information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user clicks on the interactive map and they are redirected to information on voting specific to the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used dreamweaver to put things together, and I coded in css and html5.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first website, and I am not an experienced coder; so there were many challanges. Starting the website was the hardest, because I didn't know how to code, what to code, or how to work dreamweaver. I had a question about how to make the United States map interactive, and a mentor told me to use an API. The API I found was complicated to introduce into the existing code, so that was a major issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a lot of thinking and "Googling," I found a way to not use the API, and I made the map the way I wanted it from scratch. It took longer, but I'm very happy and proud of it. I also used a css style that fixes a background image then allows me to lay an image on top in a way that gives a kinetic effect when the user scrolls down. This method upgraded the user experience and added to the asthetic of the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything that I am submitting is what I have learnt in the last 24 hours, and there is a lot. I learnt HTML5, how to work dreamweaver, how to read css, how to effectivly use open source code, and how to make a seamless user experience.
                </p>

                    What's next for Voter Information Website
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Voter Information Website is potentially going to be posted to the CMU homepage to inform students how to vote from wherever they are in the country.
