                    Inspiration- I am in rutgers IEEE and there is a competition during the spring at Brown University. It is a maze solving competition, and I wanted to have some experience with making a maze traversing program.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does- There is a randomly generated maze that has at least one wall at each vertex of squares, and a 2x2 square in the center. The block starts in the top left corner of the maze and traverses the entire maze using DFS.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it- I programmed this from scratch with java
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into- DFS was really hard to get working, I had to constantly tinker with the stacks until I finally got it running. Also getting the maze to generate within the specified rules was very hard to accomplish.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of- I have tried a few times in the past to make a DFS program on my own, and I am really proud that I was finally able to do it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - I haven't worked with java graphics much at all before, so I learned how to make use simple graphics with java.
