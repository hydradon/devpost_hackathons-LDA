                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The GreenGrocer website is hosted on Wix which communicates with our backend and Azure via REST endpoints. After a user uploads a photo of their receipt, GreenGrocer utilizes Azure's Computer Vision service to perform image to text analysis of receipts. This text is then matched to a database to look for high impact keywords. Information is retrieved and displayed to the user to help them make more informed decisions based on their purchases.
                </p>
