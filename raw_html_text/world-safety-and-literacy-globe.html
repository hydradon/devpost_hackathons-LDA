                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted something visual and interactive that could be used to represent statistics regarding safety and empowerment. We came up with a solution that can be customized in the future and presents the data colorfully and visually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It loads database info from world safety indices and global literacy rates to highlight a comparison/contrast between the two societal aspects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made python scripts to harvest the data, process csv sheets, fetch geolocation data for cities and countries, augmented proportions and range of data to highlight contrasts, and formatted the final data to be json and accepted by the webGL globe. We then formatted our WebGL globe to look the way we wanted and designed a team logo.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hosting the globe on the web. We were ultimately not versed enough/introduced to heroku properly before the hackathon and decided to host and run locally.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to harvest global data and highlight safety in a visual way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to overcome problems by analyzing code (even if a foreign language) and searching for similar situations and solutions.
