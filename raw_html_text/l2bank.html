                </h2>
                <p>
                    Online banking can be intimidating for new users. Signing up for online banking and being presented with an interface to handle your money but not being provided clear instructions can be overwhelming. Many new users are unsure about different types of bank accounts, how to deposit, transfer and perform other banking operations.

                    What L2Bank does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    L2Bank changes this by providing users a web app platform to learn and practice online banking. L2Bank focuses around an achievement based system to give the users an incentive to use the web app. L2Bank has achievements indicating tasks the user should complete to successfully learn to online bank. L2Bank allows users to create artificial bank accounts. The user can then create different types of bank accounts that range from Savings, Checking to Credit Card accounts. The user can then deposit artificial money and see what occurs in their account. They can see that transactions take time to process as they are pending. The user can also perform transfers between their different bank accounts. The web app provides a shopping simulation that provides the user with a few products to purchase using their account funds. The user can make purchases and see what occurs in their accounts. They can see that the purchase will start as pending then deduct the item cost from the account total. This simulates purchasing items using debit cards tied to their banking accounts.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using HTML, CSS, SASS, foundation, Javascript and Angular.js for the front end. The back end was created using Capital One's Hackathon API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Major challenges we ran into were hosting our project on a domain. We originally hosted the project on a github pages domain. However, github enforces HTTPS which blocks all requests to HTTP urls. Capital One's API can only be accessed through HTTP urls. We ended up removing the HTTPS enforcement by using an alternate domain name which is l2bank.me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Results
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud to have produced a working web app that does what we initially brainstormed. We were able to accomplish the functionalities that we wanted the web app to have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many aspects about the process of creating a fully function web app from scratch. We learnt about the creation of front end and the connection to the back end that handles the data. We learned how to incorporate both the front end and back end to create a functional website that can create user data, store that data and present it from the database.

                    Future of L2Bank
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be brainstorming and looking to add more innovative features to improve L2Bank to help young adults with online banking!
