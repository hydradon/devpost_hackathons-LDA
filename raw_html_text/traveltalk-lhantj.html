                    Inspiration: We both have a deep interest to travel one day.

                    What it does is it allows travelers to share their journey with other people through text and pictures via a mobile app. It is a social media platform where information about a person's journey is included for others to learn more about certain locations and experience.

                    How I built it: We used iOS software to develop a mobile app.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: We are new to programming and creating the app was a big challenge in itself.  This explains why we only got to making the login screen.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:  We created an interactive login screen and although it may not be much, it is a big accomplishment for us beginning programmers.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: We learned some of the basics of iOS development and we would like to continue exploring the software. We also learned how hackathons work and that we have a lot to learn.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TravelTalk: At some point down the line, we would like to actually develop the whole app. This will happen when our knowledge of iOS has grown considerably.
