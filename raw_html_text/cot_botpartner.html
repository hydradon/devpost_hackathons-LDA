                    Jarvis, Mark Zuckerberg's new housemate, an artificial intelligence assistant he created this year that can control appliances, play music, recognize faces and, perhaps most impressively, entertain his toddler. &ldquo;No commercial products I know of do this today, and this seems like a big opportunity."Zuckerberg said. Surprisingly, BotPartner already made it. Our chatbot is called Louis Lin, and you can control your home, including the lights, temperature, appliances via Messenger. We call this &ldquo;COT&rdquo;(Conversation of Thing).

                    The main idea behind CoT (Conversation of Thing) is to communicate with objects. You can control the internet of appliances by simply talking to communication software. To make it reality, we base on state-of-the-art technology as well as the techniques of ChatBot popping up this year, and finally we&rsquo;ve created practical CoT available for appliances. This project was part of an effort to learn about the state of artificial intelligence, and also an opportunity to experiment with cutting-edge technology at a time when voice-activated assistants like Amazon's Echo and Google Home are gaining widespread popularity.

                    Digital helpers like Apple&rsquo;s Siri and Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa have made their way to all types of gadgets, from laptops to smartwatches and home speakers. We feels that mobile devices are the right vessel for AI assistants because you&rsquo;re not restricted to only engaging with them when you&rsquo;re home. You can communicate with Louis when you're not home and even abroad. Therefore, we chose the phone to be the primary interface rather than a home device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that a helpful assistant should support both text and voice input. The input of our CoT product can be either voice or text on Messenger. During the process, we apply speech recognition and natural language processing, identify the order of the mission by cloud servers, and make command to the object in the end. It supports Chinese, English, French and Spanish.Messenger is the platform we chose, but aside from Messenger, other communication software or apps can integrate COT as well.

                    Last but not least, we hope that every developer can develop easily in order to build intelligent appliances based on our open sources which bridge the gap between hardware and software. We've released our open source code of intelligent appliances to share with more developers. The complete CoT project is under the MIT license as the link below:
