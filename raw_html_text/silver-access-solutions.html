                    Summary
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>For this project, we decided to create a website that caters towards the elderly by providing them with a web-based resource for their technology needs. From personal experience, the elderly struggle significantly when it comes to transitioning to the modern era. The experience gap is so large with technology that many stay away, or do not use it due to frustration. Our goal is to provide a basic, easy to use resource that provides them with a way to learn at their own pace on their own products with simple terminology that they can understand. 
Unlike any other website, ours consists of a very welcoming, friendly user interface. We care about how our users feel when they are learning or studying, so we have considered all possibilities to improve our users' mindset. To assist in the usage of our website, we have added a comfortable color scheme for our elderly users to feel safe and secure, gif files to have a visual representation for the steps necessary to take, and audio reading to go along with the text.

                    We provided instructions for setting up email accounts, how to download different internet browsers, and setting up a default browser. Such processes can be confusing to our users, so it has been our task over these last 24 hours to make a satisfactory and positive experience. We want them to experience the wonder and beauty of modern technology without having to deal with the frustrations of fancy or complicated modern websites.
    Not only do we provide tutorials, but we also have a terminology bank for key words that we believe are important for new users to know. Since this is a startup website, we have started small, but are looking to expand. With more improvements on our website&rsquo;s in-depth guide and a community outreach program to retirement homes, we can further expand our resource to cater to all users.
    Most importantly, we have provided a section solely based on the possible dangers the internet may hold and how you might protect yourself. Such information is critical, especially for inexperienced users as hackers are always targeting them. We want to provide our users with the best security recommendations we can offer them while not losing their understanding of the topic.
    While our main focus is on the elderly, our services can also be expanded to the younger generation and even in between. With our easy to use resource, we hope to provide a strong learning environment that brings more people into the world of modern technology.
    Our team consists of 1 Senior, 2 Juniors, and 1 sophomore. All four individuals are from the college of business&rsquo;s cyber security program and have basic experience with the fundamentals of java. Tackling a project of this magnitude was a stressful and daunting task for us as inexperienced coders. However, we believe our passion and drive to make a real life social benefit tool was worth the frustration and have worked hard to complete it within our 24-hour deadline.
