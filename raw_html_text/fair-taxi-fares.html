                    We wanted to work with data, and after tossing around some ideas and losing some time we decided to use taxi  and the google API for simplicity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app allows anyone to find the usual, approximately, taxi prices for any given pick-up and drop-off locations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We studied Pandas to implement some of the data analysis needed in the price prediction, set up a web server and ran a web app with Python Flask, and developed data scrapers for the FINRA data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were many difficulties in setting up a Flask app due to some problems without implementation, making some tasks several hours longer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We successfully developed a web application that makes real and pragmatic use of data provided by FINRA, which may've gone unused or unappreciated otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manage a project with several individuals performing in different and distinct technical roles, as well as became more acquainted with technologies like Flask.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last thing we think we ought to do with this project is put it up on a public server for public use and make the interface a bit nice, with this niche data which turns out widely useful.
