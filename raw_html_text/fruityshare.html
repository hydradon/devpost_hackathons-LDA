                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by the waste at the gardening as a result of growing excess produce and an increasing lack of sense of community.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project allows individuals within communities to share their excess produce with neighbors and acquire produce not found in their garden. The app is for trading produce to reduce waste and increase a sense of community and communication.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges. We spent about 8 hours working on a React front-end with a node.js and MySQL backend. We later realized there was an issue of running our javascript on this setup and as a result our work had gone to waste for both front end and backend. We then started over and ran into an issue with our backend as well as a major git issue which resulted in us losing files and time. As a result we could not complete the prototype so we completed a simple mockup using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in about 4 - 5 hours so we could demo our concept.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the idea, it was the most liked out of 70 ideas we had. We are also proud we did not give up and managed to make something that we can present even if we feel it is not what we would have liked
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about protyping and brainstorming efficiently. We also learned that before starting any work, we should proof of concept and a connection between the front and backend going first. This will result in a strong foundation and reduce many hours later.
