                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incredibly sophisticated phone sensors are underutilized.
Real-time workout data is motivational.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses the phone's gyroscope to track rotational velocity. From the rotational velocity profile, extracts data like number of reps performed, time per rep, time spent resting.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and the plotting library AndroidPlot, running on a borrowed Android phone (our team is all Apple users!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Forming a team was hard. The idea generated a lot of interest but several would-be team members flaked out. Then, when we were finally ready to start working, the built-in AndroidStudio GitHub integration completely failed. We had to work around it. After that, development was relatively smooth-sailing.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    First Android app! Yeah :D
Proof of concept: the rep-counting ended up being pretty accurate.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use the Android UI setup and AndroidPlot.

                <h2>
                    What's next for WorkoutTracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding better support for linear workouts (pull-ups, bench presses, etc.) using accelerometer data. The gyroscope approach is best suited to rotational workouts (curls, squats, where your arm/upper leg is rotating). Also, more importantly, saving workout data and tracking trends over time.
