                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always wanted my device to play a song/music for me, and an app will choose the song/music for me that is relative to my current state of my mood. In this way, I don't have to choose a song/music. For example, it will feel like a movie in a scene where there would be a heroic victory, and an appropriate song/music will be played in the background. Essentially, I just wanted a song or music to be played depending on my mood or the environment/atmosphere around me, but the song/music has to be very fitting and accurate toward my mood or surrounding environment/atmosphere.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an app that plays a song that is relative to your current mood. There is a list of option of moods to choose from, and when you choose your mood, a song plays.
