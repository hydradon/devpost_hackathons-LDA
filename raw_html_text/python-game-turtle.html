                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Haven't coded for quite a while so figured Id brush up my skills in python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    its an unbeatable tic tac toe game... You either end up with a draw or you lose
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the turtle module to build it as I found it easily accessible and easy to use. 
I first built the most basic game where the computer makes a move absolutely randomly
and then kept adding different scenarios and their corresponding counter moves
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to make sure that I got every scenario
also it was confusing sometimes as to for which scenarios the program should check for first
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works(kinda)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the turtle module 
Learned how much I need to learn java as android apps work on that
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Python game(turtle)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Id like to add a multiplayer option
would like to make it so that the player can play the game again without exiting the program(this is very simple to do with a user defined recursive function)
would like to make an app with other such games that people can play when they are bored during lectures
                </p>
