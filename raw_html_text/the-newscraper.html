                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tired of reading the same old news in the bloated, ad-filled format. So we decided to do something about it. A newsletter that is ad-free, and gives you all your favorite news in a short, condensed form which you can digest in seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you the daily news in a condensed and summarized form that you can read in seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We web scraped all the news articles from different websites and applied NLP on the content to summarize and sort the articles into different categories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fetching the right articles and sorting the categories of news in the designated basket.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us are front end developers and we're proud of building a website with fluid interactivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Flask, HTML/CC, web scraping large amount of data from different websites
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The NewScraper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build a recommendation engine to recommend new articles to our users. 
Also, link previous articles to the new ones so we build a story of all the news that has been published.
