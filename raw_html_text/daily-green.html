                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to make a fun story and quiz-based game to teach some interesting facts about some everyday life choices you can make to live life sustainably and combat climate change.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a website that introduces and lets you play a quiz that counts points based on the life choices you make as you go about your day. If you choose more sustainable actions throughout your day, your score increases!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a .NET framework, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we had a difficult time deciding on a game idea that everyone liked that were also compatible with our areas of expertise. Eventually we settled on this idea and got to work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to take advantage of everyone's skills so that we could all contribute to the project even if we had different levels of programming experience. We all learned a lot about CSS and Javascript!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's important to communicate effectively and patiently work through technical issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Daily Green
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps of this project require us to keep developing additional features. We'd like to connect the game with links to sustainable living organizations and some API data to learn more about what you can do to combat climate change. We also plan to improve the UI/UX by adding more choices, animations and making the website easier to navigate.
