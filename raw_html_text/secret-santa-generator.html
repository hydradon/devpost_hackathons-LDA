                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration was after talking with some friends there was a need for creating an easy way of randomising a secret Santa list so that different people gave gifts to each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in [peoples names and emails. It then mixes up the names and matches them with an email of someone who will then be instructed to buy them a gift and their name will go to someone else.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it all in Java using array lists and comparing those array lists. I also used a randomiser to create a new array of names.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Configuring the java program so it would send the emails directly. I would have worked on it if I had more time. 
Loosing part of the work which I can't remember which ran a check that the same person wasn't being matched with the same person.

                <p>
                    I have learned more about array lists how to send emails from SMTPs. Also more about what you can do in Java.

                    What's next for Secret Santa generator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the mail api so that it can directly send emails to the designated recipients and rewriting the code which checked that someone wasn't being sent their own name in an email.
