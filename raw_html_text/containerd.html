                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After going to many hackathons, we noticed one major problem: Everyone spends so much time and effort creating these beautiful hacks, but they rarely live on after that. The project would live on Devpost and Github, but you could never show your project to your friends of to the world. We set out to solve this problem by making hosting backend much simpler.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project allows users to host their backends on our server. It provides a user interface that clones a git repository to our server, installs the required dependencies, and starts the required processes. The user doesn't have to deal with ip addresses, ssh, or firewalls; their app will just work. Best of all, they are provided with a public facing url, so they can show their project to the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project sets up each app in a docker container. A flask server redirects the traffic that arrives at our server to the correct docker container.
