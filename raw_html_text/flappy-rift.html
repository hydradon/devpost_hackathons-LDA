                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really, really wanted to work with the Oculus Rift. None of us had used this before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a 3-Dimensional version of Flappy Bird.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the game development IDE called Unity to develop on the Oculus Rift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Troubleshooting the Oculus Rift. We initially tried it on 2 different Macbooks only to realize that El Capiton was no longer officially supported and because of this we could not use the positional tracker. Then we tried it on one of team members Surface Pro 3 and found out that the Surface was not able to power the Rift. Eventually, we ended up bringing in one of our own desktops which made it possible to render what was being displayed on the Rift. None of us had any prior experience with game development. We also had to find workarounds for functions that Unity has but does not support for the Rift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the fact that we got a game running with no prior knowledge of Unity, especially since we were able to incorporate the Oculus Rift. We all played a different part and were able to bring everything together and make a functional game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about game development with Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flappy Rift
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to put this up on a web site and improve visuals.
