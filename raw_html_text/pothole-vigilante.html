                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pot holes suck and it's hard to fix them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We put an IOT box on your car with a bunch of sensors. We tell when you go over a pothole, and when you do we register it on a map and send a tweet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hooked up a bunch of sensors to an Intel Edison that can tell when you hit a pothole. We then used MQTT (a low bandwidth protocol) to have the Edison ping our server whenever one is hit. Our server is hosted on a Raspberry Pi, and is capable of displaying a map of the known potholes with the Google Map API, and tweets every time it sees a new pothole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the accelerometer working with the Edison was difficult, and we couldn't get the Raspberry Pi working until we managed to find a monitor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The map and Twitter feed are pretty great, and getting the whole system to run on two single-board computers is even better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out the MQTT protocol and how to use both the Raspberry Pi and the Intel Edison. In writing the backend we also learned a ton about Flask, SQLite, and the Google Maps and Twitter APIs.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pothole Vigilante
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever Gotham is in danger of suspension breakage, we want it to turn on a spotlight aimed at the clouds with a picture of a giant pothole on it.
