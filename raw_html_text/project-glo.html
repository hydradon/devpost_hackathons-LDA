                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To help improve the daily lives by simplifying an individuals schedule - from parents with busy schedule, to children with ADHD and those with early-on set dementia and mental health issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A garment that helps with your schedule through LED colored lights embedded in your fabric that communicates with your plans through an app/website.
You will always have a physical &amp; color-coded reminder about your daily plans!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we made an idea and drafted a design, there we got our materials to start drafting the garment while coding the motherboard to use the LED lights. We also designed and built a double sided ribbed knitted fabric used for our garment, the ribbed tubes included in the fabric design holds the LEDs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the four of us are design students, doing anything IT related was struggling. Dila &amp; Eric taught themselves how to use the coding program in order to work the Feather HUZZAH.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely learning how to code, learning about the industrial knitting machine and working as a team to identify and fix our issues as efficiently as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about coding, soldering, components for IT and using the industrial knitting machine to make incredible products.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PROJECT GLO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If people are interested in this idea, we would love to go through and find a sponsor who would take control of the technological areas of our project.
