                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the growing importance of convenience in modern applications, we thought making a music player that automatically chooses songs based on the emotion conveyed through the facial expression of the user would make listening to music easier in a car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our music player uses a AI to analyze the facial expression of the user to determine their emotion, then accordingly chooses songs to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built upon the given API from Octave Group and implemented the facial emotion recognition using Google Vision API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had difficulty finding a way to determine which genre of songs to play given each emotion. We also had difficulty making the front-end, and we ended up scrapping the original idea of a Material design UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We trained our AI ourselves using a set of training data that we have collected ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with different API's and train an AI.

                    What's next for aMuseMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to implement constant facial tracking for real-time update of the music playlist. We also intend to implement a liking feature where users can like their songs and these songs will be played more often according to their moods.
