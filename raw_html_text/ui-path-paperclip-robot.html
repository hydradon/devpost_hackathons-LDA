                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have a strong desire and will to make paperclips.
But, I sometimes don't always have the time to be making paperclips.
So I wanted a robot to make paperclips for me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This robot can make paperclips super fast.
Not only that, it understands how to sell these paperclips online, it knows supply and demand and can change the price dynamically.
The robot buys its own supply of wires and knows that it should be buying wires when it's cheapest. The wires that the robot buys eventually ends up to become paper clips
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used UIPath Studio and used a bunch of flowcharts for the robot to automate the task of making paperclips.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning UIPath Studio is a journey. I learned the many advantages and disadvantages of learning UIPath Studio. UIPath Studio is very different from low-level programming languages. UIPath is very easy to understand but also very easy to mess up if you are a messy programmer like me
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of learning a new tool to help automate tasks. I am proud of making this project. I am proud to be here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about UIPath Studio and its style of programming.

                    What's next for UI Path Paperclip Robot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, I will use my Paperclip Robot to enslave humanity, Conquer Earth's resources and turn the entire Universe into paperclips
