                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something that was equal parts useful, innovative, and helpful to the community. With the increasing usefulness of voice assistants, we decided to try to improve the educational applications of this technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an application using google cloud services, in specific, dialogue flow and natural language processing. This app alllows you to practice speeches. The quality of these pracitce speeches are evaulated using natural language processing heuristics, which we apply to our speech data using google cloud NLP api's.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and flask for our webhook development and heroku for webhook hosting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The details of dialogflow were challenging. Especially as it related to managing contexts for more complex dialog sequences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Future of our hack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think we could expand this into an extremely useful platform for education. Features we wanted to implement but weren't able to due to time contstraints included automatic user recongition via voice printing and more advanced recommendation tools for serving educational content via constructed user profiles.
