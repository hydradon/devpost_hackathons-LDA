                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is always a sense of danger, even with a daily routine such as going to school, work, or even home. The level increases for females, who experience more danger when walking alone. We want to create an application to help ease the fear in even the most simple activity.
                </p>

                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website sends an urgent message to an emergency contact if the user does not finish their commute in the estimated amount of time. It shows the current location of the user when the website is loaded and user input for destination, amount of time to wait, and the emergency number.

                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website was built using google Maps API and a combination of web programming languages. In particular, the Google APIs we referenced were geo-location and Matrix. The programming languages used were PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. We also integrated twilio for sms as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many different languages and their fundamentals in a short period of time. Due to our inexperience, we faced many problems and unknown errors often. Some mistakes took hours and some took minutes. The most challenging experience was the amount of circles we walked around for hours for some of these mistakes.

                    Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our effort we poured into this project. We persevered these past few days, and even through it was challenging we still did not give up. Although the finished project has a lot of improvements needed, we still were able to keep the concept alive.

                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this event we explored languages that we only briefly touched on before. We learned more about these web programming languages and the best language to implement depend on our needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Future Goals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In future, we hope to expand this idea to different platforms, such as mobile application and wearable technology (such as fit bit, apple watch) to allow better convenience for the user. We also plan to learn more about web development, clean up the back-end of the website we created, and add more features to give the user more options.
