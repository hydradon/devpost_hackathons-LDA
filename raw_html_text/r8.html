                    <em>
                        r8 was inspired by some popular social media mobile apps including Snapchat and Instagram. The app is based on the mobile camera, and the ability to share pictures with friends and family, which has become an integral part of social media over the past few years.

                        r8 is an android application that allows users to rate and share pictures with friends and family.

                    <em>
                        r8 allows users to take pictures with their mobile camera and give it a rating. The photos are then uploaded to cloud storage where other users can rate and comment. r8 provides a feed where users can see pictures, their ratings, and their comments uploaded in real time.

                    <em>
                        We built r8 using android studio, with a dyanmo database and an s3 cloud storage. We used Amazon Web Service's lambda functions as a server-less back end that allowed us to trigger the database and cloud storage link.

                    <em>
                        Amazon web service does not have documentation on many of their features making them extremely difficult to implement. UserID retrieval, lambda function triggers, uploading to the database, downloading from the database.

                <p>
                    _ We learned a lot about mobile app development, specifically android app development. We learned how to code in Android Studio, how to work with dynamo database and s3. We also had to understand Amazon Web Services, the lambda functions, coding in python, and UI development.

                <p>
                    We will add emojis to our rating system, and add the ability to caption pictures. We will also add the ability to add friends and a tab that shows only friends' posts. A second tab will show posts in a geographical region around the user's location
