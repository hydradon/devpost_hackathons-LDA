                    We wanted to make being informed about current events easier and more efficient

                    Our website considers a user's reading preferences and commute time to find news articles that will pique their interest and that they will be able to finish before they reach their destination
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We used Python (specifically the News API and Flask) for the back-end and HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front-end
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    On the front-end, we created multiple prototypes of the home page to find a user interface that was the most intuitive ans aesthetically pleasing. We were faced with the challenge of using new, unfamiliar APIs on the back-end.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We are proud of the new technologies we learned and creating a project with multiple layers.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned that creating a user interface is not as straight-forward as initially thought to be. Also, we improved our ability to solve issues pertaining to new environments and programming tools.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We would like to integrate Google Maps API and make our website responsive so it is easier to use on mobile devices. We would also like to improve our user interface. We would like our application to get user-feedback so it can better recommend articles based on the user's reading speed and the user's reading preferences.
