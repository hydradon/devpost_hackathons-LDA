                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was August of 2008 in San Francisco. My friends and I were going to Burning Man. Each of us had to pay a $100 share to buy a generator for a small camp of folks. Apparently it was cheaper to buy than rent. We only used it for a week. Next time I had to buy a generator was also while preparing for Burning Man, in 2013, with another group of friends. The same story. We bought generator, never saw it again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows individuals, small businesses, or companies to rent out industrial equipment down to an hourly rate. This allows for cheaper costs and overhead.

                <h2>
                    Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cost. In a US market of $40B dollars per year, it is still very expensive to rent equipment. 
Oligopoly - local markets are still controlled by a handful of middleman companies.
Lack of innovation - hourly and per-minute rentals are unheard of. 
Low utilization of equipment owned by contractors.

                    Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A blockchain-based solution for locking, renting and collecting fees, in the form of mobile app and a website where owners of equipment list and rent their own equipment to others.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to fully test out our chaincode due to a proxy error with IBM Bluemix about an hour before

                <h2>
                    Why Blockchain? Which problem does Hyperledger solve?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Contractors don&rsquo;t always trust each other. Blockchain solves the trust problem between contractors. Hyperledger allows building permission-based networks of blockchain nodes with private transactions (not visible to outside parties), yet available for audit by regulators.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Is it a decentralized autonomous organization?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No, it&rsquo;s software solution for real-world individuals and organizations who may want to become rental companies but are not always trusted in their marketplaces.

                    Dealers of equipment now can become rental companies.
