                    For many, drinking can be an enjoyable, social activity. However, it&rsquo;s important to keep tabs on your safety, as well: If you&rsquo;re falling on your face, you&rsquo;re probably not having a good time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That&rsquo;s why Hack@UCF members have created DrunKnights, a simple mobile app that helps you keep track of what you drink, and when. With DrunKnights, keeping an eye on your BAC has never been easier, so nights out can finally be as safe as they are fun.
