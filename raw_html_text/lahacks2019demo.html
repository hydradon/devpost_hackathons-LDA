                    Language Learning app in Android!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to make an app where you can take a picture and the app translates all the objects in the picture for you into a different language. That way, if you forget the word for something in a different language, or you just wanted a new tool to assist you in learning a new language, you could use our app!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to develop this for Android, as the back-end was nicer than swift (with Java). We also used xml for the front end, and we used 3 APIs: Google Translate API, Google Cloud Vision API, and the Android Camera API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The toughest parts of this project were figuring out the APIs and merging our moving parts. Eventually, we managed to figure everything out and got a working product.
