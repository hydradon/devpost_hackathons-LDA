                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many times my parents are always confused about what to make for our meals.  They usually come back home beat from work, and they are too tired to make us anything, let alone think of a meal.  Not only them, but students also get too lazy to cook actual food.  As a result, they resort to unhealthy fast-foods.  I've seen many times if folks get the inspiration for a meal, they'll cook out their vision and enjoy an actual meal for once.
