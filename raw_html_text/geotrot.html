                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Geologists often rely on accurate satellite data and street images to accurately identify where they are the field. To better serve the needs for accurate and precise mapping for areas with dense natural resources (minerals, forests, water, etc.). According to the University of Pittsburgh Department of Geology and Environmental Science website, their students are embarking on areas of research that include, but are not limited to "isotope geochemistry, applied geophysics and tectonics, paleoclimatology, planetary science, remote sensing and GIS, volcanology, and human-environmental interactions" (Geology.pitt.edu 2017). So, obviously, this is more than just kicking up dirt. We want to change that making their work more accurate when off the beaten path.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    GeoTrot allows you, the avid outdoorsman,  to take geotagged photos and upload it to a shared network with the goal of building a repository to supplement google street view.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GeoTrot was built using a web platform based partially on the Google maps API and a built-in repository.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges included learning how to use the Google API and ironing bugs in the development of the service and its host platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a website for the project that also includes mobile functionality. Additionally, it is a project we truly believe can be of use within academia and beyond.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code in java, refined our HTML skills and learned how to use the Google API.

                    What's next for GeoTrot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next update for geotrot will include the ability to see all the photos the user has taken on a map with its accurate geotag
