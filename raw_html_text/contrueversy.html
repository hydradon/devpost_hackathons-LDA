                <h2>
                    We decided that the apparent bias in news articles was a primary cause in the polarized society we live in. Raw truth is hard to come by, and we tried a unique approach to allow readers to formulate a knowledgeable truth integrated from different viewpoints.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Contrueversy juxtaposes two articles on the same topic side by side on the same page. It has five main topics and randomly generates pairs of articles based on the topic selected. This allows readers to gain a sense of the other side of an argument while reading what they may typically believe.

                    We built it through Cloud9 using HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Because we had never used SQL on Cloud9 before, we found it difficult to set up the databases using the right credentials. It was also hard to format the page to align with our purpose of juxtaposition.

                <h2>
                    We are proud of finally sorting through the initial technical difficulties with the server and proceeding with our idea on a relatively new platform. (Also, we're pretty proud of the logo.)

                <h2>
                    We learned to integrate both our differing skills in coding and creativity to create one product. Through this process, not only did we learn more about website developing, we also learned more about the biases that plague society today.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We hope to expand the sources of Contrueversy and maybe divide it into subtopics. We also hope to create a more efficient algorithm to extract biased news articles. We also want to continue stylizing the visual aesthetic of the website.
