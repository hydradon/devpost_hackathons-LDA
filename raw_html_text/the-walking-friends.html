                    We hope to make the world more open and increase connection between people by letting Facebook friends play the same game together. Moreover, we hope to design a game that really pushes the player to reason, to strategize, and use his/her brain to organize under thorough consideration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also include our past study in Network Engineering to design and evaluate the behaviors of network and the spread of info through complex network. We hope to device networks that maximally simulate real-world network and make our zombie game as realistic as possible!
                </p>

                    Be a hero! And have fun.
