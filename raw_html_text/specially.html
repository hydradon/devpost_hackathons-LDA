                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Did you ever forget mum's birthday because mum happened to follow the lunar calendar (yes, in the 21st century) for her birthdays? And get kicked out of your house? Or your anniversary with your girl/boyfriend? And get dumped?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Worry no more, reserve a special GIF message for them!
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>

Now not only will you never get into a fight because you loved ones think that you forgot their birthday, your messages can also come with the dopest gifs. Make your loved one's day and your day easier.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a Flask app that takes a message along with a GIF searched from the content of your message and saves that message in a PostgreSQL database and uses Celery to prearrange them to be sent through. When the time comes that you want to send to your loved ones, along with when you want us to send it.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The designing and communicating of the webpage and specific actions of the application was a challenge as a big team of six. Combining separate work from all six of us was also challenging.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a database to save reserved messages that wasn't necessary for the demo but would be needed later.
Our website design and layout was done mostly by Rachel, who is a first-time HTML/CSS learner. Getting the API call to Giphy to work was a big deal. I'm still not sure why it wasn't working at first, but after moving the API call to it's own file and running it from my browser things were working perfectly. The only thing to do after that was parse the data and figure out how we wanted to display the GIFs. Once that was done, we tweaked the code until it did exactly what we wanted it to, which is show three GIFs and highlight the selected GIF.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being this a first hackathon, I determinedly learned front end developing. I mostly worked on html &amp; css. Designed the webpage. There were challenges in combing the GIF's, webpage &amp; design.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add features such as timezone and automatic calls to give users a wider variety of choice.
