                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed that TJ students had created a study guide group on Facebook where they post study guides for their different tests. However, simply uploading documents and pictures is unorganized, and it&rsquo;s hard to find the right study guide for your test the next day. We wanted to create something where students could still upload their study guides, but it would be organized by class and school to make study guides easier to find!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students can upload study guides by pressing the upload button, where they will be prompted for a Google Doc url, document name, name, and school name. Students can also find other study guides using the drop down menu up top.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off trying to use a Java applet and HTML/CSS to code the website. We worked on this for about 5 hours before finally at 11 pm, we decided to start over and use solely HTML and CSS. None of the four people on our team knew how HTML and CSS worked, so we all had to learn really quickly and try to create a working website.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we're proud of us overcoming the challenge of starting from the very basics. We raced against time to try and learn as much as we could. We're really glad that at the end, we have a working website to show for our efforts!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use HTML/CSS to create a website, to learn from the online community, and read APIs. We learned how vast the subject of computer science truly is. Previously, we had only known Java through the Foundations class. Now, we've been exposed to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We discovered that through perseverance and determination, anything can happen!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next steps include adding an account system so people can log in and post study guides, a rating system for guides, and further formatting the site to make it easier to use and navigate.
