                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by my own adventures to create a website to sell things, but was met with the one thing a kid couldn't face on his own: A credit card form. Everything costed money and my parents obviously would not pay for it as they didn't see a ROI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's basically the entire backend of a website built to sell items. You would need to connect a (Mongo) database, use your own API keys, and add the items with the required information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using NodeJS and Express with a lot of other smaller projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a lot of bugs I hadn't seen before because of the wifi restrictions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first big Node/Express project and I'm fairly sure I learned how to organize a large project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the nitty-gritty of Express and other packages, and learned how to organize a large project in Node.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stripe Boilerplate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I believe that this can be an alternative to Weebly/Shopify as it's free, open-source, and you can learn to code while building a cool website.
