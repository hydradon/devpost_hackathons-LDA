                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website provides basic information about the growing carbon emission problem. It also allows for the user to calculate the carbon footprint they leave after using different types of transportation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the framework for the website using HTML and CSS. The carbon emission calculator works through JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We weren't proficient in JavaScript, so we had to learn as we coded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Carbon Emission
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goals are to expand the calculator to calculate the carbon emission that a person has overall in one day. This would extend beyond transportation into AC, heating, lights, etc. We would then also like to get sponsors for eco-friendly options to decrease the carbon emission.
