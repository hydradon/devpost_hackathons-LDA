                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a frequent commuters, we often face delayed buses and gridlock traffic, it can take twice as long to get home on the weekends and even longer for other commuters. We personally experienced these unexpected horrible delays due to local events. We wanted this problem so that others can prepare their travel in advance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SwiftTrip is an iPhone app that allows users to look up a list of local events and plan transportation rides accordingly. They can choose different forms of transportation and routes. It even encourages commuting! The Map and List view make it easier for the user to see to analyze in a way that they prefer, from tables to maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, we wanted to incorporate Google's API within our app, but after many attempts we decided to create the application using only Xcode. We first started by creating a list table view of all the events as well as an add event page. We then focused on the map view of our application. We utilized the iOS language Swift within the Xcode platform. We discussed how to produce great data visualizations for our users through User Interface Design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we ran into was asynchronous and synchronous data within our application in the Map View. Although we received the support from numerous mentor, we still were unable to fully understand a concept called completion handler block. We then decided that even though we didn't have the resources or experience to accomplish one part of our project, we still thought we could provide a prototype of how the app would work in the future. Another problem we faced was adding radius circles around pins in our Map View. We looked at a plethora of resources in order to incorporate this feature in our project. We believe that we were unable to accomplish this feature because they limited amount of time offered in this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to saw that one major part of our app is fully functionally. Moreover, this project was written in a language that was not familiar to the majority of team members. We were able to communicate easily within our group. Everybody had a positive attitude during the whole experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the complexitiy of Google Maps and different types of programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SwiftTrip
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to incorporate a working Map View if we were to release this in the future. Also we would like to incorporate more APIs into our project
