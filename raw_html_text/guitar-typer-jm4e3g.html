                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Guitar Typer takes in input entirely through a Guitar Hero Guitar controller and translates it into easy and usable text. This is naturally done through a rhythm-based interface in such a way that sacrifices little inconvenience for a large tradeoff in user enjoyment. Text is displayed to the user via falling letters in a highly optimized pattern that maximizes speed and efficiency while keeping true to the spirit of Guitar Hero gameplay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Guitar Typer was built almost entirely in Java. We made use of various libraries and SDKs to generate the GUI interface and handle the logic involved with converting Notes-to-Text. We used XInput to take in the inputs from the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a large amount of planning needed before implementation. Deciding on the most capable frameworks and programming languages to use was one of the biggest challenges. We also dedicated a large amount of time on optimizing letter frequency with an ergonomic sense of playing Guitar Hero.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about how the frameworks we used interact with the Windows operating system. We also spent a very large number of hours on polishing our guitar GUI as best as we could.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Guitar Typer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on implementing Guitar Typer for mobile computing devices and possibly other operating systems in the near future. Stay tuned to see more !
