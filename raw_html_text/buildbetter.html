                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3d- modelling has always been a very resource intensive and restrictive field to get into. Most of the used software's are expensive or resource intensive. It's also a boring process for most people to get into. To make it more fun and accessible for everyone we came up with Build Better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an easy-to-use software to visualize your 3d models and build complex designs from basic blocks. You can use voice commands to switch between various blocks and it helps you build a bigger project. The best part is it uses LEAP motion to make it possible for you place and design your projects using your hand gestures. So you emulate playing LEGOs on a computer and make designing/modelling fun again!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by integrating the LEAP motion sensor to a Unity environment, where use the native capabilities of the device to integrate voice recognition.  The prototype is a Universal Windows Platform app and most of the functionality added was using C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team of three was very inexperienced with using Unity and C# both of them caused a lot of issues. The bigger challenge for this project was probably Physics, as 3 CS students with no particular interest in physics defining these rules was a big issue. However, we were able to support each other and complement our skills to finally build the product. 
P.S.  Microphones not working is the worst thing that can happen to an app that use voice commands.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be able to complete the MVP successfully and learn a lot of Unity, C#, effective communication and team work. And also last but not the least understanding Physics.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C#, Unity and 3d-modelling.

                    What's next for BuildBetter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Include Vuforia to build AR models out of the designs created, support more basic materials and port it to other operating systems. We also aim to make it more hardware independent in the future so it maybe accessed by phones, tablets etc.
