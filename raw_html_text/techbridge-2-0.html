                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a one-year-old daughter, I wanted to get behind a cause that would inspire her to pursue a career in STEM

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a web app in MEAN that would provide interested parents and volunteers the ability to enter their information saving Techbridge time with manual entry.
                </p>

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used typeform to create a great UX for our end-users. This information is then sent to Google Sheets via Zapier and then sent to their salesforce Org using Zapier.
