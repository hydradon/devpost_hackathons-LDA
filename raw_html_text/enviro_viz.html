                <p>
                    The importance of water for sustaining the livelihood of humans, animals and plants alike is obvious, as is the fact that the amount of water we use now directly reduces the amount of water available per person for the future as the global population continues to grow. What is
                    <em>

                    </em>
                    so obvious is that the amount of water consumed by different countries varies greatly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being aware of differences in water usage across nations challenges assumptions we may have about what is the "norm" regarding water use. For example, a certain amount of water can mean a 30-minute shower in one country but a 2-day drinking water supply in another country!
