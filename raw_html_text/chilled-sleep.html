                    Inspiration-We knew that if you sleep between certain temperatures, you'll get a more restful sleep and feel better.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does-Chilled Sleep monitors your sleep quality and changes the temperature of your room to better suit you.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it-Using node.js we wrote a program that links up with the nest thermostat.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into- We had a lot of trouble setting up a virtual nest on our laptops and getting it to communicate properly. We also had to learn new coding strategies to get a working prototype.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of- We have a working prototype of the software needed for Chilled Sleep to function. We have set up a virtual nest (thermostat) and a server, that can be used for future development.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned- We all learned new ways of programming, and how to set up a cloud-based server that can be accessed by everyone. We've also gained a lot of valuable experience in Javascript, Node.js, and local servers.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chilled Sleep- The next step that we are working on is finishing the app for smartwatches and polishing the UI.
