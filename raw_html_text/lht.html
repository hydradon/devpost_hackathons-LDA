                    We were surprised to learn that there were no special gameday schedules for when there are games at Wrigley, which leads to overcrowding of trains. We wanted to develop the optimal schedule for trains going through Addison to take care of the additional riders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used our background in economics and calculus to derive an equation for the uptick in the number of riders going in and out of Addison during gamedays. We also compiled data from the CTA in order to make educated changes to the schedule.

                    Challenges we faced were using Git for the first time as well as figuring out the proper equation to use for fans.
