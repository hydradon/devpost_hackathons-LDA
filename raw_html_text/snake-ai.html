                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is built in Javascript to be easily shared and played over the web.
The AI was initially planned to be created in Python (pun not intended). The front end is completely built in HTML and Javascript using Bootstrap.

                    The original essence of the game is recreated, with the snake allowed to go through walls.
