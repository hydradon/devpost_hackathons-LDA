                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After attending the Civic Hacking workshop, we discovered that one of the biggest problems in cities is that litter and trash is a common problem and is very evident on the streets, so we wanted to do something that would benefit society. However, we did deliberate on some other ideas, such as, games and extensions. But in the end, we decided that it would be most beneficial to help the world stay cleaner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before you throw something away, this website (which we wanted to make into an app but did not have enough knowledge to do so) allows you to type in the object name that you are throwing away and the computer will check every input default in the code until it reaches that particular one. It will then display on the screen whether it belongs in the recycling can or garbage can.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by trials and errors and looking up information on new languages and concepts. In the actual code, we run two prompts which, based on the user input, output "Recyclable" or "Non-Recyclable" on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges that we ran into were getting the variable of the user's answer into the program. After multiple failures to do so, we switched to a longer, yet easier way of doing things and did a "switch-case" scenario. Also, since we are still learning, we had to research things and sometimes, it was not easy to find what we needed that fit well with the program. We, basically, were doing things and applying them on site, for the very first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud about are finishing the actual project because it took a long time. Also, overcoming the gap where for like 12 hours, we did not know what we were doing. We created something pretty neat and full of potential, despite not being so experienced with all the languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned new concepts in html, javascript and css. Also, experience, which is always a great lesson.
                </p>

                    What's next for Trashr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning eventually to know enough to run this website as an application on Android and iOS apple systems, and utilize web-databases for smarter search.
