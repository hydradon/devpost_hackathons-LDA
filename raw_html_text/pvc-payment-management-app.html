                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love the function of Github as a platform to keep track of the version history of pull and push requests. This gives us the idea of keeping track of and handling the transactions when it comes to buying a product from online shopping platform. Having the idea of going dutch in paying something, and also sharing the cost of paying something might make us to be hard to keep track of our expenses, we have decided to come up with PVC.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly built the mobile application using Outsystems, and parts of the the server with Python Flask, hosted by Heroku.
                    <strong>
                        (To use the app, log in with this account created - Username: Test1// Password: 123456)

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Outsystems deals with all the server action with GUI which may require much time to understand the features provided and features that need to be implemented by us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built more than 15 screens for the application, another thing is that we had handle the database and linking to ensure the seamless flow of whole application.
                </p>

                <p>
                    -Can be further extended to make payment for a product that is not supposed to be on online shopping platform, e.g. sharing the cost in a trip in foreign country 
-Allows the implementation of chatgroup and linksharing in the application, to ease the communication between users
-Supports PayLater option, which allows payment installment and the sending of notifications to the user that has not pay for their part when the deadline is approaching
