                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never done any big projects for fun, as I am just a freshman and started very recently, but I wanted to take on a big challenge in a short period of time, I knew I would run into many problems and not nearly be finished, but I knew it would also teach me a lot, which is why I chose to opt out of using frameworks, so I could really challenge myself instead of using premade tools (outside the java libraries of course).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game runs just how any other does, with an update loop and a draw function. However, the engine runs by using a stack to manage different states. On top of this, there is also a bit of physics in movement for the character.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    parsing map files
rendering animations
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The stack, and the hashmaps used to manage the stack.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot. A looooooooot. How games are made, how tilesets and backgrounds work, how to pass in images to java and rendering them, making animations, using hashmaps, cleaning up code, managing resources. I picked one of the most challenging things to do for a reason, and that was to become more comfortable using the language I use most.
                </p>

                    What's next for Generic RPG XI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will probably fix certain things, add a world map state, figure out how to read XML files as a tileset(the worst when you have never worked with XML files) and I will not just stop doing things because I have things to do still.
