                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have two young daughters at home that love to play games. They also love to talk to Alexa to tell her to play music and change the lights. I thought we need a way to put these together. Then one night when they were playing my older daughter was telling the younger on to go find toys in the toy room and bring them back while she counted. I thought that would be a cool thing for Alexa to do. So I created it.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa tells kids an item to find around the house.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used C# .net web API to build the endpoint that Amazon communicates with.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    I had some issues with the certification security. After looking through a few blog post I was able to work through it.
