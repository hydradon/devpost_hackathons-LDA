                    Being a musician, it can be tedious to find other musicians to collaborate with, so I wanted to find a way to make it easier.

                <p>
                    STRUM can match you with other musicians in your area based off of what instruments you are looking for or how serious of collaboration you would like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using python, I simply made a program to input user data into a file to create a unique profile for their STRUM page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this development, I changed the direction of the code multiple times, and along with other setbacks, had a hard-drive failure in the computer I was working on forcing me to re-code the program by memory with 2 hours left in the competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am proud of this project coming together as well as it did because it explored aspects of python that I was not familiar with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about dealing with lists and writing to files, particularly json files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    STRUM will catch on nationwide and hopefully globally to musicians convenience everywhere.
