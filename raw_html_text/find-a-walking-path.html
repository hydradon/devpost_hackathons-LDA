                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I often go on runs, and sometimes struggle to plan route that's the desired distance that I aim to run that day, and believed that I wasn't the only one struggline with the problem. Thus I decided to create 'Find a Walking Path!' to help mine, as well as other people's problems!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user enters their location and desired path length by running the python console.
The console will return directions for a path that is approximately the desired length, and will save a rough visualization of the route to the user's desktop which can be opened as an html file
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using the google maps api, as well as basic python knowledge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Calculating the coordantes for path segments required manipulation of the haversine formula, as there was no public method at the time of attempting to do so. 
Another challenge I faced was not being able to integrate both the path visualization and the 
path directions into a webwage that would be launched upon entering the required parameter. This was purely due to lack of experience, and I aim to be able to do ths in the near future
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm content with the progress I made in terms of learning the google maps api as I've had no previous experience with any apis
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt that patience is key when learning new concepts and tools, and have gained an affinitty for creating new projects such as this one, as there are a nice mental break
                </p>
