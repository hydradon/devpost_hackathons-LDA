                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a very art-enthusiastic niece that can't get enough of drawing pictures, she regularly asks people for suggestions on what to draw, with this skill, Alexa can offer up a range of creative, interesting scenarios!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Produces random art challenges ideas, in the form of either characters or environments.
                </p>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    My niece was a huge fan and have since tested it with various family friends and their kids with positive reactions!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One key area of interest was to ensure that commands were simple and with little ambiguity between calls to keep kid-friendly use in mind.
