                    The website was created by four Iowa State students for a Digital Women code camp. Code camp is where college students get together to explore coding while mentors guide them. We designed this website to help find nearby hospitals for users while also showing the current wait times. Clicking the link above connects the users with a database showing the hospitals nearby using current location via google maps. From there the database lists the wait time, the hospitals contact information, and directions to the hospital. We want to thank Digital Women for putting together code camp and all the mentors helping us achieve this website. We also want to thank all the sponsors.
