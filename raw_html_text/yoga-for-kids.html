                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Last month, I visited my primary school where I spent 10 years of my life studying different subjects. But this time I was very shocked to see teachers and students practicing Yoga all together. I was really impressed and very happy to see my school including Yoga as a subject. At that point in time, idea of creating Alexa skill for kids yoga crossed my mind.

                    Children derive enormous benefits from yoga. Physically, it enhances their flexibility, strength, coordination, and body awareness. In addition, their concentration and sense of calmness and relaxation improves. Doing yoga, children exercise, play, connect more deeply with the inner self, and develop an intimate relationship with the natural world that surrounds them. Yoga brings that marvelous inner light that all children have to the surface.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps kids do yoga poses, breathing exercises and meditation. It also helps them understand the benefits of Yoga, breathing exercises and meditation with benefits section.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have build it using Storyline platform.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make voice based skill that helps kid learn yoga poses step by step and help them learn breathing exercises with count check. It is really difficult to design something like these for kids who find it hard to interact with such electronic devices.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first skill for kids. and i am pretty sure that I have made it through. Kids will find it interesting and challenging as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you want to create something for kids, you have to be a kid. pheeeeewww. That was really tough. But now i know what all things you should keep in mind while creating skill for kids so that they don't get lost.

                    What's next for Yoga for kids
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next phase includes, new yoga poses, breathing exercises and different types of guided meditations for kids. I am getting in touch with kids Yoga and meditation practitioners to get more idea on yoga practice, controlled breathing and guided meditation.  With help of the experts of their field, I am going to create new unique and innovative yoga poses, breathing exercises and meditation practices that kids can benefit from. As this is my first attempt towards creating skill where Alexa gets more interactive with kids and keeps track of breath counts, I am planning to spend some more time and do more research on Alexa  speech technology. Once campaign is over, my plan is to get in touch with few more like minded developers and build a team for future projects where we share our knowledge, nurture new ideas and research more and more and create mind blowing skills for kids. In my opinion, College freshers would make a great team. Fresh thoughts, high on energy and best in class technology - Alexa. So if I get a chance I would pick college freshers and begin my startup journey.
