                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members lives in NYC and wanted a way to keep track of all the of awesome performances he saw.

                <p>
                    Vybecity is an app targeted towards city dwellers that want to imbibe the charm of the place. Restaurants and cinemas are stagnant places but street performers are ever-moving and pop up unexpectedly. Vybecity helps you look at street performances happening near you at the time so you could maybe have some fun on your way back from work or maybe remember to catch your favorite breakdancing crew when they come next.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift and Parse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using GitHub with Swift was really complicated because the merging process had potential to go terribly wrong.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It&rsquo;s my first hackathon and it was just amazing to have 4 people in a team focussed as ever towards one academically independent project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It&rsquo;s always good to have a clear idea of what you want your app to do and who&rsquo;s going to use it. The bottom-up approach towards design helped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VybeCity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps we could meet up again sometime to refine the aesthetic of the app. A few design elements got left on standby due to obvious time constraints.
