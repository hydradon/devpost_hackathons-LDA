                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saw the invitation on Saturday, January 6, 2018. Wanted to start creating Alexa skills. Thought of a game that my 5 and 6 year-olds could play. Ask them if they would like to play red light green light. They were excited and said yes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Guides children as they play red light green light in the home. The game reminds children to walk in the home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Alexa sample skills to come up to speed and see what type of commands were necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being new to the Alexa skills development space, coming up to speed on the commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Started and completed the skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a ton. I also learned that I have a ton more to learn.
                </p>
