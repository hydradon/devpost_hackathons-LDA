                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As four third-year science students, we're all trying to figure out where we want to be and what we want to do after graduation. This means searching through a bunch of school websites to find individual details, program requirements, and deadlines, which can become extremely overwhelming and confusing. To help others avoid clicking through all these websites like we did, we created The Lost Scientist to display all this information in a clear and consolidated manner!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Lost Scientist is a central hub for all things post-grad. You're able to select which type of professional career path you'd like to pursue, and we'll provide you all the major details about which schools you can attend in Ontario, what examinations you need to write, how much tuition you'll pay, and when you should apply.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the website using HTML/CSS to display various post-grad options and integrated APIs as a reminder system to send texts about approaching deadlines. Clicking on the link utilizes the APIs, Atrigger and MessageBird for scheduled notifications on specific days. Currently, Atrigger has yet to be set up, but the URL works to send a text (to one of us) saying "Application due in 3 days!!!"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As beginners, we were very limited in our knowledge of HTML/CSS and programming in general, so we had to ask many questions and search up solutions online. As well, we had difficulty trying to figure out how to integrate APIs directly into the website interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact we were able to produce a tangible product at the end, despite our very limited knowledge!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basic web development skills using HTML/CSS and how to use an API to send text messages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Lost Scientist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating our APIs directly into our website, to allow users to sign up for notifications about impending application deadlines. Expanding the variety of post-grad options that are featured on our website in and outside of Canada, as we currently only focus on medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and optometry.
