                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are hundreds of clothing drives, food drives, and supply drives, but there are never any donation drives for feminine products. Feminine products are a necessity and should be treated as such. We wanted to create a platform that would allow all women to get access to the care and supplies that they need.

                    We build an IOS/Android app and a website. For the app, we used outsystems and for the website, we used wixiste.
