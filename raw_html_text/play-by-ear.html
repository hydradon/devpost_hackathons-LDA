                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Savannah has experience learning to play piano by reading sheet music but has never mastered playing solely by ear. We decided to develop a program that can teach anyone wanting to learn the chords and associate keys with memory and sound.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program presents an octave on a piano. It will play a chord or an interval based on player preference and the player must repeat the correct sequence with the correct keys to progress in the game. By doing this, they will hopefully begin to retain knowledge of the keys by the sounds they make, versus only using sheet music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using game maker studio we created key objects that make a sound when depressed. The color of the key changes to indicate that it is being played, and then if the sequence is correct, a success screen will play, and a new challenge will be presented to the player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our entire team is most familiar with Java and this is our first trek into game making, so the whole experience was a new one for all of us, which brought about many of its own challenges and rewards both.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal for Ehacks was simply to learn something new, so to be able to learn to use this program as well as complete a game is something we're all extremely proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this experience, we learned to cooperate as a team to create and complete a united effort. We learned a new interface, Game Maker Studio 2 which will no doubt be useful to us in the future, and by learning to navigate this program we gained some experience in learning a new coding language that is unfamiliar to us and using it to suit our goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Play By Ear
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next goal for this project would be to expand the keyboard. We would want to give the option to learn all of the different octaves to be found on a piano or keyboard, versus just C to C.
