                <p>
                    Bed Bath &amp; Beyonc&eacute; would like to tackle the Department of Education &ndash; Aloha + Curricular Database Challenge by creating a user-friendly platform for professionals, students, and the general public to strive towards a greener, more sustainable Hawaii by fostering community and coalitions. We are dedicated to creating a resourceful database for school projects, volunteering, financial contributions, sustainability practices, and more. Through innovating lasting solutions at the local and regional levels, we seek to empower next generations to be a force of positive change in the world.

                    About Lokahi Hub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web-based platform will seamlessly allow users to easily broadcast their projects/programmes, provide support in various forms, and communicate effortlessly with one another. DoE curriculum branch could search, certify, and credit projects based on the subject matter standards which include Science, Mathematics, STEM, Arts, Languages, and Civics. Crosswalked projects will be given badges for future references. Another notable feature of Lokahi Hub is donation. It is open for everybody to either donate directly to their school of choice or let DoE community engagement branch distribute equity accordingly. 
Lokahi Hub was built with Atlas, Bootstrap, CSS, Ejs, Express.js, Heroku, HTML, MongoDB, MVC, and Node.js

                    Lessons Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prioritisation is necessary when there is a limited amount of time. Our team came up with amazing functionalities and features during initiation phase but had to narrow down slightly in order to submit our solution on time. However, we believe that this is an ongoing project due to the diversity of projects and the rapid development of technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Epilogue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue improving our solution for better user experiences and less of a learning curve. We aim to make Lokahi Hub available as not only a website but also a mobile app so that interested parties can access it whenever and wherever they wish to. 
Finally, it takes a village to build a community and we hope Lokahi Hub can contribute to promoting project-based learning as well as sustainability in Hawaii. Lokahi Hub, a website for every project type.
