                <h2>
                    Inspiration: The inspiration of our website was our team's passion for memes. We liked horse heads and were enticed by the prize offered for having the hilarious website and, thus decided to make a thread similar to Reddit but, better managed and more meme/joke focused.  We also made a card castle in our free time to chill out when we were exhausted after a long coding session which ultimately was beautiful
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Our platform is a meme and funny jokes thread ran by us and, allows for users to post memes if they email the memes and jokes to us; this is our basic example and the basic framework of what our service may look like in the future. We chose to incorporate images/memes with our jokes in order to enhance the comedic effect and make it easier on the viewer's eyes.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: I first used a basic web design that I had made. Then I had added the memes to the horse head picture. Afterward, we had to add the text which was pretty easy to add and, then added text colors. We also added horse heads for the top and bottom borders which worked well. Finally, we made a color-changing signature to end our masterpiece.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: There were some segments of codes that were extremely brutal to create i.e the loading cursor. It was also a struggle to create elements due to the ridiculous clutter of programming in such a short burst of time resulting in losing a few elements we would have loved to integrate
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: We were the proudest of our cursor as it easily required the most effort and, generally was a pain to create. It was an extremely proud feeling when we were successful in integrating our codes to create a beautiful final project.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned:  I took away that JavaScript as it was not easy to debug. I also found that patience was vital when finding content on our site which was appropriate and hilarious. We also learned that if we all work together then, we could create something we were are extremely proud of. We also learned part of CSS and HTML when designing an interface for the website.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HORSE HEADS?!?: We want to make this a public meme and funny post platform and, add a better system for users to post their memes and making sure it is a safe place for people to be on unlike, systems like Reddit which is a  very unmonitored platform. We also would like this system to be smooth and easy-to-use as well as having a filtering system for types of memes/jokes that people may want to use.
