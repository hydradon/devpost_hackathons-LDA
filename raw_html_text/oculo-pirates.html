                    There are hundreds of stories of people with learning disabilities. We decided to come up with an application to help them enjoy their education. 
This is our first hackathon, and we decided to experiment with the Oculus-rift as Virtual reality is allover the place these days. 
The Oculus-rift provides an environment for kids to have fun while learning. Being first timers, we came up with a simple game for the same.
