                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the right pet is hard, despite the fact that there are so many pets in need of homes! To solve this problem, we built a new system to find loving homes for these pets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PetLove provides a Tinder-esque interface for "matching" up with pets. You can either post a pet to find it a home, or search for pets in your area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're looking to adopt, you can swipe left or right to indicate which pets you would like to meet with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, you might be trying to get your pet adopted. Maybe you're moving to somewhere that does not allow pets, or perhaps you represent an animal shelter trying to find homes for your furry friends. In either case, you can post your pets on PetLove! Once somebody else has indicated an interest in your pet, you can&nbsp;use the swipe interface to tell us whether you think they're a good match.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you've both indicated that you would like to meet, we help you get together at a safe place. Then, if all goes well, you can negotiate the adoption!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PetLove is built with Scala/Mongo backend and an Angular/Node.js frontend. We split into two teams of two to build the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging using multiple web technologies for the first time. A lot of the time was spent learning and building. Every time a problem was encountered we had to spend time searching for a solution. We ran into two main challenges over 24 hours. Integrating MongoDB and Scala was challenging because of the lack of documentation. Another issue was networking routing issues, where the client and server could not communicated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quickly picked on Typescript, Angular/Node.js, Scala, and Mongo. 
Creating the frontend and backend of a website in 24 hours. We were able to come together and plan and execute a solution. The solution we came up with will hopefully help pets stay out of shelters around the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how to use Scala, Mongo, Typescript, and Angular/Node. We learned that we can work well under pressure. It was surprising how much can be accomplished in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PetLove
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In 24 hours, we were not able to fully implement our idea. In the future, we want to further implement our idea and add more features.
