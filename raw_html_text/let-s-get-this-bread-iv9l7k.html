                <p>
                    In a dire situation, victims of abuse may not be able to obtain recordings of the abuse without being severely harmed. Our project aims to solve that problem.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project creates an easy way to inconspicuously record your conversations. Simply send (609) 256-6938 a text or call in order to receive a call that you can excuse yourself to take. The project will begin to record your conversation as soon as you pick up, and securely store the recording in Twilio's servers, available for access at any time.

                    We have also created a business front in order to make these communications seem less suspicious. At

                    , we have set up a bakery called Ivylands Bakery, for which our phone number is the main contact point. As well, if you email the business front at
                    <code>
                        ivylandsbakery@gmail.com

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the site from the ground up using pure HTML and CSS. We coded the backend using Twilio's Python API bindings, and used curl to test our script.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble getting Twilio to format our specific response. As well, a lot of us were new to using Git and GitHub, so we had to work through the problems that arose there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of pushing through all of the problems to submit a complete project, even though hackRU was the first hackthon for the majority of our members.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group got a crash course in Python and HTML, as well as learning how to make pull requests and use Git. We also learned how Twilio webhooks worked, and used them to create a custom response to a text or call.

                    What's next for us?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to further integrate our services with Twilio, automatically separating the left audio channel from the right channel so that any computer can play the requested audio.
