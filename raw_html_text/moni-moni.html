                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team drew inspiration from our lives as first-year university students. We found that it was difficult to achieve the fine balance between good academic results, social lives, physical health and good financial status. 
As such, this game emphasizes the struggles of budgeting and living on your own in university and hopes to prepare students for this kind of decision-making.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moni Moni is a game targeted towards students heading to university. The game provides a simulation where students are given a set amount of money and choose where they allocate these spendings.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided tasks into two teams; two people were responsible for coding the game using C and the other three were in charge of the promotional website using html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was severely lacking in knowledge and experience since 3 of our members were coding for the first time. 
It was difficult to think of a project that was both interesting and suitable for our skill level. We were initially too ambitious with our ideas despite not having a good grasp of the programs we were using. As such, we had to adjust our plan and refer to online resources to learn skills as we went.

                    Our team is proud of having a functional website, although only locally, as well as putting a simple game together.
