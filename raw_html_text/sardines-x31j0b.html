                    Surprisingly, in 2019 we get targeted ads based on places we visit, yet wasting time in the queue is still a problem. We propose a solution to this.

                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is currently no commonly used service providing real-time information about crowd density on inmportant places (restaurants, shops, sport events, ...)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obtains real time data about crowd size at certain locations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every device connected to the WiFi periodically sends WiFi probe requests, so that the user can quickly switch routers if needed. We "sniff" these probe requests on our 3 Raspberry Pis in order to estimate crowd sizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are 3 components to our project:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We needed to set up the Raspberry Pi's so that they would sniff the WiFi probe requests and continuously send the acquired data to our database
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We set up a database on AWS that would receive the raw data in order to obtain a count of probe requests and send the properly formatted to the website.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We set up a website that shows the live map of EPFL and the density of people.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up the Raspberry Pi's to detect the WiFi probe requests: The software for this is really poorly documented online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially we also had communication problems as we all wanted to do everything perfectly -- we quickly learnt that in order to make progress we had to trust that everyone in the team would do their work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that, despite the many issues encountered during installations and setting up the raspberry-pi, we managed to pull through. While we all had different tasks, we helped each other out whenever someone encountered a bottleneck, and this team effort was key in getting a working prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Set monitor mode on raspberry to be able to sniff and use probe requests from any wifi device. From that, we estimate the crowd size at a certain place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use cloud services to collect raw data coming from IOT devices and process them to be able to display a nice crowd visualization on a frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sardines
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Of course, the first goal is more raspberry-pi!
And then, more raspberry-pi!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joking aside, another idea we had is to use the crowd data to some get time-series on crowd (think of temperature data). This is also similar to what google does with location rates.
