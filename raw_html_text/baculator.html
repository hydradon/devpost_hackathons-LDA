                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recognize that the drinking culture at UW-Madison is quite large. This does not mean, however, that people should be entirely unsafe about their drinking habits, nor should they feel ostracized for wanting to be careful about their drinking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Approximates the blood alcohol content of the user based on their gender, weight, and time between drinks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized CloudPebble, Pebble's cloud-based IDE, to create a C program that runs solely on the Pebble Watch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to implement a clock to be displayed while the calculator ran in the background, but we ran into difficulties in the formatting, so we scrapped it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created our first fully-functional Pebble program of substance. That in it of itself was a huge accomplishment for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drink responsibly!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BACulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, we'd like to successfully integrate the watch face into the program and make it more aesthetically appealing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Blood Alcohol Content varies per person. Use good judgement before making any decisions. BACulator is not a precise tool. Please never drink and drive.

                    <em>
                        The BAC calculator updates by the minute, but BAC obviously drops very slowly, so it may take some time for results to be noticeable.
