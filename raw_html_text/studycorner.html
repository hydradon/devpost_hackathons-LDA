                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives students the opportunity to create and join study sessions with their fellow peers based on location. SlugCorner will alert students if there is a nearby session and and who is already in the session. SlugCorner is also able to populate the student's classes automatically using their MyUCSC information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Laravel 5.2 framework as back-end development and Xcode for the front-end. SlugCorner fetches data from our MySQL database in order to piece together what the user is subscribed to in terms of classes and study sessions. Once the MyUCSC information is provided, it is encrypted and sent to the school site to retrieve their class information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very little foundation with both iOS development and php.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Achieving a solid understanding of how the back-end and front-end of an app communicate with one another.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
