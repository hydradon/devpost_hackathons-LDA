                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration comes from our own personal experiences of trying to find recipes that taste good and meet the nutrient requirements needed to achieve our health goals (i.e. Protein, Carbs, Fats, etc.)
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    No longer do you have to spend countless hours trying to plan meals to live a healthier life. This app takes in as input the user's physical specs as well as their goal weight. Using this information, Brown Bag prescribes a plan for nutrient intake to help the user reach their goal within seconds. In addition calculating the necessary food intake, Brown Bag also gives daily recipes for however many meals the user plans on eating per day. The daily recipes suggested will be guaranteed to meet the daily nutrients requirement and the app will keep track of the nutrients ingested.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a recipe API (edamam-nutrition) to get a list of recipes that matched certain thresholds (Protein, Carbs and Fat). The User Interface for this app is implemented using swift and the firebase database to provide an easy to build meal plan with the ability to choose food you actually enjoy.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge ran into is manipulating the edamam-nutrition API to give us results in the structure that we wanted. The processing of the original data from edamam-nutrition proved to be non trivial.

                    What's next for Brown Bag
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is an overall vision for Brown Bag of that was not feasibly implemented in one day. The most significant goal is to optimize the options based on cost. The idea is to create a weekly plan as well as a shopping list at the beginning of the week for the user. The weekly recipes will take into account cost as well as shopping and ingredient efficiency to truly provide an easy path to healthy nutrients for users without breaking the bank.
