                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How slow disaster relief and developing a faster method of delivering aid.

                <p>
                    Pudl is a hub where the community can discuss what to do and support disaster survivors. If one needs supplies, they fill out a form that allows us to send the supplies as fast as we can so they could pull through the crisis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used atom.io and used the languages of CSS, HTML5, and javascript to create a straightforward interface that users can easily navigate through to seek the aid they desire.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We overcame organizational issues, a lack of overall understanding, bugs, and spacing of various parts to create a website that we are proud to present to the judges.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first hackathon, and we are really proud of the project we created in the time that we are given. We are also proud that we grasped a much better understanding of coding in general as well as HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to shape a basic website with embedded content, pop-ups, vibrant colors, spacing, and how to work together as a team to create a product that we are extremely proud of.
                </p>

                    What's next for Pudl
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envision to partner with faster delivery services, large tech companies, charities, and the World Health Organization to better the chances of survival for those who are experiencing a crisis.
