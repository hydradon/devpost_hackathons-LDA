                    Not knowing how to code proficiently was an obstacle. At one point the app kept crashing and I couldn't figure out why. I had to break every connection and start over to figure out what was happening but I got it working again.

                    Making it somewhat functional. I almost gave up a some points. I learned a lot about Swift and CloudKit.

                    It isn't even close to being finished. I'll keep working on it because I've really enjoyed working on it so far. It has helped me learn a lot!
