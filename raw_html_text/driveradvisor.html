                    Most of people would like to spent less time on getting to the job. We live in Minsk, Belarus, and though we have a good public transport system, most people use car to get to the job. In most cases it's faster, but sometimes because of traffic accidents and jams it's really slow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we decided to build a chat bot that will not your route to the job and give you advice each morning how can you get to job in the fastest way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Lex to connect the chat bot to messenger and lambda function to process date that we store in DynamoDB, also we you Google Maps API to know the fastest way through the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had a bunch of problems :) At first we found documentation for Google API and it was for previous version, so we have experienced some unexpected results. It was also challenging to build the app in AWS, but it went almost smooth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that now we have some experience with AWS that had not before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned Serverless and AWS, gained some soft skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are planning to contribute in DriverAdvisor.
