                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an IoT device with the DragonBoard. We've also have had previous inspiration to work with the Google Calendar API. So we put the two together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It grabs your events from your google calendar the night before and sets an alarm with enough time prior to your first event to wake you up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python to interface with the google calendar API. We also used python to access the expansion ports on the DragonBoard and write logic to control the led and buzzers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time trying to figure out how to work with python datetime library. Also trying to understand what arguments the google calendar api needed passed in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are software people, so it was fun to figure out how to use the Dragonboard and the arduino components. Our code actually works too; nothing is hardcoded. We are proud of the fact that we were able to get our alarm clock interfacing with the Google Calendar API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about controlling hardware components with software, how to use the python DateTime library, that coding with TimeZones is tricky, and how to interface with the google Calendar API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DragonClock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a user-facing application that will interface with the DragonClock get it set up on the user's wifi, and let the user authenticate the device to access the Google Calendar. It would also be fun to 3-D print a case for the alarm clock.
