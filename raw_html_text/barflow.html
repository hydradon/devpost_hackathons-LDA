                <p>
                    Some people just want to have a beer. Those people who are busy dancing, chilling with friends, or trying to catch a bus don't have time to wait for the bartender...

                    <li>
                        It creates a virtual tab through an android app that tracks payments throughout the night and allows users to pay their bills through their phones.

                    <li>
                        It saves users time and gets them their drinks much faster.

                    <li>
                        It facilitates social interaction by allowing users easy ways of purchasing drinks for each other.

                    <li>
                        It allows bartenders access to detailed data and analytics directly from users.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote server side code in python and deployed it to a raspberry pi which takes inputs from volumetric flow sensors in order to track the amount of beer poured at one time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wrote client software for Android that interfaces with the raspberry pi server to open tabs and track how much beer was dispensed and how much money a user would be charged
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created functions to scrape real time data off of the sensor box to create a faster app.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Socket communication was a challenge, so was properly configuring the raspberry pi to get sensor input.

                    How server-client models work.

                <p>
                    Expanding the range of data collected by the server, Implementing more secure payment options.
