                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What inspired us was the troubles that many people we knew faced with their menstrual cycle. We've always been taught that it's something to be ashamed of, and recently a white male politician had said that sanitary products are not a necessity. We wanted to help build awareness about periods and what they entailed in order to show that yes, they are natural, yes, sanitary products are a necessity, and yes, it is not taboo to talk about it. (Especially with how it intersects with class, race, the LGBT+ community and the disabled peoples).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is a race against time in which people collect sanitary products (a menstrual cup, a pad, or a tampon), and depending on how long the product actually lasts you in real life we adjusted how much time it would give you. We also made ice an enemy, because many people who get their periods do not realize that cold foods can actually interfere with your period/give you worse cramps. The longer you play the game, the more our would be sponsors would donate to people who do not have access to these necessities. The website is a more educational place in which we go more into depth with out research, our cause, and information about periods people should be aware of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game through Unity, and the website through Atom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our computer's continued to crash, so we constantly loss progress with the game. One of us also never coded ever in her life, so she actually built the website by herself after teaching herself website coding in less than 24 hours. Also, a bug came by at one point and it was pretty terrifying, not gonna lie.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing! Our goals! We finished the the game to actually create and infinite platform and respawns without any prior experience of infinite spawning or parallax. Also made our own sprites, our own logos, and did so. much. research about all the intersections so we became more educated as well. One of us finished a website homepage without any coding experience prior to this, and we ended up so proud of what we finished!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to code, how to make scenes on Unity, how to make buttons, how to make sprites, how to Unity, how deep the menstruation stigma and problems actually are, and how to become more patient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sanguine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're going to try to find possible sponsors and finish the actual game (we didn't finish fixing the time record)! We want to expand the community of Sanguine and hopefully publish it to a bigger audience!
