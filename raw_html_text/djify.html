                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all use Spotify on the daily, and we were looking for a way to share our favorite music in real-time with our friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It syncs with your Spotify player and creates a room where you can play music for other people as a DJ
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in React and MongoDB
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Client-server communication, it made us have to restart and essentially move all our API calls to the front-end, which meant we couldn't really store that data on the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a very beautiful app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely go for full intended functionality before focusing on design
                </p>
