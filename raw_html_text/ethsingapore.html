                        Stablecoin (DAI) is rewarded in proportion to the total dividends earned on the side-chain.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used standard NodeJS to build the bridge node, which communicates between both chains via event listening. Loom SDK is used as the side-chain. We also built a UI with Vue framework for users to buy security tokens and withdraw their dividends earned in the form of DAI, as well as for companies to create and issue their own security tokens.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    Integration with the Loom network dapp chain.
