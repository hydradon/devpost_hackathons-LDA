                    which has been growing day by day and hindering a child&rsquo;s growth. Our concern is secure our children and find an effective solution to prevent child sexual abuse.

                        Augmented Reality is a boon to the technology. With the implementation of augmented reality, we can develop a 3D character which would interact with child likewise a cartoon friend of them. It would be full of ease and comfortable for a child to interact with a cartoon character. As it has been observed that children always want a cartoon character to be their best friend in reality.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The augmented character would be generated in a real life which would create an illusion for a child that &ldquo;Cartoon is alive and there is someone in reality who is talking to them&rdquo;.
In addition to this, the augmented character is supposed to teach about &ldquo;good touch and bad touch&rdquo; in an interactive way along with that it  would ask some well-structured questions to know the mental state of a child whether he or she would be suffering from any severe dilemma or is being suffering from any barbarity by someone in his/ her surrounding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main aim is to teach a child about such misdeed, prepare him/ her for any such violence and if there&rsquo;s been such misconduct then such offence could be unveiled which would turn out to be a powerful aid for all the teachers and parents who are insecure for their students and child. Furthermore, all responses would be recorded  for further action.
