                <h2>
                    We wanted to share our frugalness with others by creating an app that helps save money by setting goals. We knew that saving money was important for a rainy day and other emergencies, especially when money is tight, as well as foster good habits.

                    AccountAbility allows the user to input and keep track of expenses, income, and savings goals.

                <h2>
                    We used AndroidStudio to develop our Android App.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    This app was our first Android App, so we were learning a lot throughout the whole process. Creating tabs were the most challenging because it required the synchronization of different activities and appearances.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We are proud of how the goal-setting process works because it synthesizes income and spending to show how savings goals could be completed.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned how Android apps functioned in terms of structure, syntax, and the different libraries.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    AccountAbility will have its user interface enhanced. Analysis of spending, like pie charts, would better help users understand their spending and help them create better goals. Categories of income and spending could be appropriated so the user only need add recurring costs and earnings once.
