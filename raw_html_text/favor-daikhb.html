                    It allows users access a network of neighbors. By listing your stuff available for borrowing to your neighbors, you can lend with your consent. Similarly you can borrow stuff from others with a small amount of transaction fee for each items. We will also expand our business to borrowing and lending a hand, like shovel snow or help moving furnitures.
