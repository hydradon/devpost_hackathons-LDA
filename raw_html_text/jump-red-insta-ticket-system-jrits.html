                    Innovation Proposed :  Jump Red Insta-Ticket System&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a well known problem with respect to Indian traffic, that many people , deliberately  jump the Red signals on the squares. Since police cant be deployed on all the square it is very difficult to stop this habit . Therefore, recently, the authorities are experimenting with deploying Camera at some important squares in the city. However, if we look to this system , it has a number of short coming . Typically they are costly and therefore can&rsquo;t be installed on all the squares. Then  at control room of Police, they have to deploy a big team to observe the traffic through deployed camera on multiple video screens. Some time processing of video images need to be used ( like registration plate recognition etc). All this process is very time consuming, tedious, need continuous monitoring, and manual interventions. To ease out this burning issue , we propose a simple and accurate system to identify a defaulter who jumps a red light on a square in the city.

                <p>
                    The innovation here proposes an appropriate re-engineering of existing Electronic Toll Collection system. In this system , a vehicle is equipped  with a low cost passive RFID . When such vehicle goes through a Toll Plaza , the toll amount is automatically deducted from the passenger&rsquo;s account.

                <p>
                    In the innovation here , we modify the system appropriately  as: 1-  When the Red light on a square turns on for a particular road, then only the RFID receiver is turned On to receive the RFID data ( situated on a vehicle trying to jump the Red signal) . At this moment , the receiver receives RFID signal/data and sends it to control room for necessary information generation, records and further the Ticket/fine amount could be debited from the bank account  of the defaulter.
