                <p>
                    To win this competition with the best project  possible | 
To learn new skills that we can apply/build on in the future

                <p>
                    This program was supposed to be able to use an Oculus Rift and The Leap Motion technologies to play connect four against an AI, where the AI was made via a neural network system |
Store the training data on a server via AWS Elastic Beanstalk

                <p>
                    Allows two users to play connect four over the command prompt (in progress) or using the Leap Motion (also in progress)
