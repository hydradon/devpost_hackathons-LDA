                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1 million people use ASL as their main way to communicate, but not everyone understands it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A glove that could translate ASL into letters on a visual display for non-ASL users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the flex/bend sensors and attached them on each finger of a glove. Then, we connected the flex/bend sensors to a texas instrument MSP430F5529 launchpad for display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our codes to translate do not work as expected. 
Other technical devices were not working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea is thought-out well and relevant to the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware coding and how HackHolyoke works in general ('cause this is our first time for most of us)
                </p>

                    What's next for Thanos: ASL Translator Glove
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a lot of improvements needed, such as getting the codes to run and adding on other elements.
