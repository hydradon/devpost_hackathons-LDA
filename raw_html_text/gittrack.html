                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During projects you'll often be asked to log times in a time tool. The problem is that usually you're too occupied with coding to be thinking of logging that time (not to mention those times you quickly change something small in the middle of the night)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It attempts to guess from when to when you've been working on what. We also make an Atom plugin which helps you track even more accurate what you've been coding on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by building out the backend which connects to Github and starts collecting data to help you figure out from when to when you work.
