                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift as an client side and MongoDB stitch as server
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MongoDB has lack of documentation on iOS, and even though it has an documentation of functions, there were outdated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we have not completed the app yet, but it was pretty interesting using the mongoDB Stitch.
                </p>

                    What's next for LetterToMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to implement more functionality in the app, we will keep working on it until mongoDB to improve their documentation on iOS
