                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to challenge ourselves and dive into a language we knew nothing about, and see how much we could learn in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app uses GPS to get the user's coordinates and displays the information on nearby features of the campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally tried to use TensorFlow with Android Studio, but after 15 hours of going in the complete wrong direction, we switched to Xcode and CoreLocation to make an iOS app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TensorFlow was the biggest challenge we ran into. It was not very intuitive and the tutorials were rather vague and confusing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to do what we set our minds to and overcome any challenges we faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of a new language and now have experience using CoreLocation!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CampusSpots
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand the amount of features that the app will identify for the user, add other campuses, and improve the UI.
