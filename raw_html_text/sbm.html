                    Purpose:
We want to create an easy platform for patients and caretakers to keep notes and interact with one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is the problem?
Poor communication among caretakers. It is rare that caretakers (doctors, relatives, therapists, PCAs, etc) interact with one another about the same patient.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our proposed idea:
We decided to build an Android app using Android Studio. Our app opens up to a sign-in screen and then takes the user to the homepage. The homepage has three buttons on it that gives the user the option to "My Health Notes", "View Care Network", or "Add/Remove Caretaker". This provides a simple platform for people of all ages to easily track and be tracked by approved individuals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How this fixes the issue:
By linking them together on a private network, these caretakers can easily share relevant information with one another and post notes that other caretakers can view. This would also allow doctors to get notes about specific patients across hospitals. For example, one doctor may not have notes about a patient because the patient had previously gone to a different hospital.
                </p>

                    What's next?
We would like to see this be developed further to allow people all across the world to look after and care for their loved ones more easily.
