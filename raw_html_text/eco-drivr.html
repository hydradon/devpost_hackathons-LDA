                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We at Eco-Dash wanted to create an application that can run on the heads up display that would allow drivers to view their own driving habits and compare themselves against their community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eco-Dash reads in telemetry data from the cars numerous sensors, such as vehicle speed, steering angle, and engine speed (RPM), and calculates a driving score based on how the driver is operating their vehicle. The driver can also see their score based against their local community, friends, or many other options
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is a fully functioning full stack web application (capable of being ported to an in car infotainment console). The front end UI is built primarily with React.js and React-RT-Chart.js for visualizations. This application will then talk to an express server running on a Node.js instance sitting inside of an AWS - EC2 Compute node.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data! The telemetry data is roughly 70,000 rows of data across 5 trips with over 30 columns worth of data across each trip. In addition, all rows aren't fully populated with data. So our scoring algorithms had to be sufficient to be able to give drivers partial scores and take into consideration prior data / driving habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of creating a fully-functional full-stack application in less than 24 hours (we showed up late). With a backend scoring algorithm which took into consideration numerous different data points, and held up even when data is absent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How you form data is very important, and to ensure your algorithms can withstand null entries! Also, React charting frameworks are difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eco-Dash
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporating social media aspects, allowing you to share your scores with your friends on Facebook, export data for insurance companies, etc
                </p>
