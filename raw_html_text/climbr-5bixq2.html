                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many members of our group enjoy climbing, but more specifically outdoor climbing. However, the learning curve is not only daunting, but also physically and mentally challenging. Climbr is the perfect app built which will match you to the perfect partner based on your location and other parameters.
A recent study shows that number of lone climber deaths have increased over time hence building the intention behind building this app is to prevent these unnecessary deaths.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Climbr has two main functionalities: it has a social section that allows you to private message and group message others to plan your next climbing trip. The other functionality is that it keeps track of your previous climbs, allowing you to easily track your climbing progress.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front end using html5 and css to give it an interactive interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us were using new technologies and frameworks that we never touched before. Along with a limited time scope, we were not able to successful integrate the back end to the front end of the project. We also had to drop certain features such as Radar.io due to the immense learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was our first Hackathon, we are proud that we were able to persist with the project and learn new technologies and skills. Although we were not able to finish our project, we are proud of the process we went.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time management skills and team management skills are heavily required for group projects, as one may overvalue/undervalue their abilities (which happened to us), and with poor communication, we were unable to accomplish our project.

                    A successful front and back end implementation.
