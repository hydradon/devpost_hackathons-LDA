                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interested in working with machine learning and the Clarifai API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Can take audio and convert it into a picture to have it analyzed by Clarifai's machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a space filled curve library to create visual representations of audio binaries. We trained a model to recognize words from pictures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were finding a way to represent the audio binaries as a picture. Our original approach was through javascript but later reverted to python in order to work with the space filled curve library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully communicated with an API. It was our first time working with machine learning and we were excited to see our model respond so positively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to train a Clarifai model and what a space filled curve was. We also learned how to manage a project with git.
                </p>

                    What's next for ADKI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A GUI to help with training and streamline the experience. More words for our model to recognize.
