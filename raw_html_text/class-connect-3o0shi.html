                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use moodle to get information about our classes, but it does not encourage peer and student-professor interactions. This app will make group projects, planning events, live class broadcasts, and many more things to become much easier for the student to manage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So far, students can log in through their facebook account on the app, which will bring them through to their profile activity. There, they can access and see info about the classes that they are enrolled in. With more time, we would implement full databases for information about students, and classes. Classes can show the professor, and assignments for the students. The student database can show student name, email, and ID numbers. Lastly, we would allow for live broadcasting through Facebook live, for professors to broadcast classes from the app, and students could watch the class on the app as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio and implemented the facebook SDK to allow for facebook login access for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the facebook login brought about many challenges, as we have limited experience with SDK implementation before. Also, accessing user data was a big challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of implementing the Facebook SDK on android studio. It was quite rewarding for us to log in to our own accounts. We also are proud of the icon that we created for the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned much about app development, and how to access and implement various APIs and SDKs.
                </p>

                    What's next for Class Connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to implement the live broadcast feature into this app.
