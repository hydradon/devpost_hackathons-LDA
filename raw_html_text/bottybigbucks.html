                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to a recent study by the National Endowment for Financial Education and George Washington University, only 8 percent of millennials who participated in the study had a high level of knowledge, while about a quarter, or 24 percent, demonstrated just a basic understanding of how to manage their money. Bankrate.com states that only 28 percent of Americans meet their monthly savings goals.

                <p>
                    We want to change this by teaching young people financial concepts that will help them save for retirement.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing chatbots as an interface, we take students through interactive lessons about financial concepts like compound interest so they can internalize them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Python flask to build web app, and then we used Google APIs for application deployment and chatbot development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning the documentation for the Google Cloud APIs was tough due to lack of experience with cloud solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had to think outside the box to get the Aladdin API to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had experience with chatbots and we were able to create a working chatbot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our group learned a completely new micro web framework and were able to build a application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we were able to incorporate completely new APIs (GCP and Aladdin) as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of clean data and how much work it is to clean/manipulate data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how some API documentation is not thorough enough, so we will strive to properly document in the future.
                </p>

                    What's next for BottyBigBucks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporate more machine learning and AI in our chatbots to automate training and testing of the chatbots.
