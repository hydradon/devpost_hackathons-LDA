                <p>
                    SCENARIO   You and 7 friends go out to dinner. You all order dishes of varying prices and have a nice time. But when the check comes, you are in a bit of a pickle. To your dismay, the waitress informs you that you may not split the check. Glances shift around the table. There's an awkward silence. There's no choice - you step up and cover the entire meal. "You all owe me," you announce to your friends. The order is incredibly complicated, and to make it worse, some have cash, some have credit, and no one seems to have the right amount of change. What do you do?
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeps a running tab on how much your friends owe you, and how much you owe your friends. Has two features to make tab-keeping easy: a bill-splitter calculator and manual charging. The bill-splitter can split any restaurant check evenly amongst a group of people, and the manual charger allows you to bill your friends individually, or if you owe them, you can document that as well. When it comes time to pay, you only have to pay the net difference, and not several back-and-forth transactions that can make payments confusing and tedious.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, and a bit of imagination :). Also necessary: StackOverflow and the Cloud9 IDE
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out trying to build an app for Pebble. Three hours later, we had managed to draw a rectangle on the tiny watchface, so we switched tactics to a website. Hosting with MLH's domain didn't work for us (which we only figured out after two hours of trying), we couldn't get our database to connect, and Dennis makes a lot of typos when sleep deprived (you mean there's no store_reslut function in PHP??!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website looks great and actually works!!! All of the forms work, you can divide a bill and charge that amount directly, you can manually charge people or charge yourself, numbers are color-coded depending on whether they are positive and negative, you can send people emails.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't be too ambitious with your projects -- otherwise, you'll run into dead ends and become easily frustrated. Teammates are invaluable for debugging. When it feels like the world is ending, take a break and play some Drawful. Life is good
                </p>

                    What's next for Settle The Tab
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement a receipt scanner that will allow you to automatically charge people just by taking a picture of your restaurant bill. We would like to integrate social media and other apps such as Venmo to allow quick payments, in addition to a notification system to alert people of due bills.
