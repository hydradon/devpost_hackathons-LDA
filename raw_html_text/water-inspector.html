People want a voice to tell their opinion, especially when they are upset. They want their opinion to be heard and to have an impact. Also, they are more and more connected to the globalised world and can grasp easier when things are not going well by comparison to other places. They care about their kids and they are aiming for a better life.

                    Shortages of water has a direct impact on living and polluted water is affecting their finances and health. When water is a problem and the whole community is affected, people want to change things.

                <p>
                    Water Inspector is a tool to collect data from average citizens about industry players that need guidance to be more sustainable. 
Q1: What is the address of the company that has a negative impact on your water? Open field - Required
Q2: What does this company produce? Two choices: fabrics and other (to account for other industries) - Required
Q3: What is the name of the company? Open field
Q4: Is there other information that you think is relevant? Open field
Data is displayed visually on a map and areas and companies with high reporting rates are now mapped.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have created a Google form and used an Addon Geocode to display the addresses introduced by citizens as points on the map. Also, used AppSheet to transform the Google form into an app. However, since I'm not registered as a payer I can't publish the app or segment the data so that the new respondents don't see the rest of the responses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't have any coding experience and I couldn't build a form that gets the location of the participant and shows it on the map, so there wouldn't be any typing involved. Also, would be useful to be able to move the location point, as the participant might not be in front of the factory when he is reporting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time to use addons and very happy that data can be updated in real time. It's not a prototype, but a tool that can be used as it is. However, I would test it first; for example, reaching out to branches of WWF and asking them to translate it in the local language to have a proper wording and asking 5 locals to answer and see what concerns/ situations are raised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm proud to able to do this by myself, but I think the journey would have been more fun in a team that believed in this idea.

                    I should start learning to code, so that I have more flexibility in the tools that I imagine :))
