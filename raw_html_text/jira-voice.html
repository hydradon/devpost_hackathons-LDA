                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As developers, we want to spend as much of our time coding as possible. When it comes to managing our agile sprints and issues, we want to be as quick and efficient as we can. That is where JIRA Voice comes in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you start up JIRA voice on the Amazon Echo, it will present you with an overview of your current open issues. You can then perform actions such as hearing the summary of an issue or changing certain fields, such as description or assignee. You can even add a comment on the issue in order to communicate effectively with your team!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some commands that JIRA Voice can handle:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Alexa, start JIRA Voice" // This loads your issues and presents you with an overview
"Update the summary of issue 10001 to say As a user, I want to log in so that I can access the application"
"Add a comment to issue 10001 saying great work, team"
"Update the description of issue 10001 to say the primary issue with this bug is..."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JIRA Voice is an Amazon Alexa Skill, backed by Node.js. Not only did we have to properly code all of the backend, but we also had to properly configure the Alexa Skill in AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we ran into was figuring out how to properly configure the Alexa Skill and developing the API interactions with Node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the fact that we were able to develop a (mostly) functioning Amazon Alexa Skill. We are even more proud of the fact that each of us learned something about a technology that he had never used before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our plan going into this project was to develop an application for a technology we were unfamiliar with, so that we could spend this time learning as much as possible. The primary thing that we learned was how to create Alexa skills. Beyond that, we also learned how to use Node.js and how to interact with REST APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JIRA Voice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for JIRA voice is to build out an authentication workflow and add more features, such as the ability to perform multiple actions at once. We also need to thoroughly test the Skill in order to train Amazon's natural language feature.
