                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Team is made up of 4 Stony Brook students interested in hackathons. We have noticed the obvious lack of student-run hackathons on our campus. The history of student-run hackathons at Stony Brook has been something not as successful as most of us students would like it to be. In a pursuit to learn and understand more about how students/hacakthon enthusiasts can create long lasting hackathons, we have decided to visualize the history of hackathons in the past few years and relate it to geo-location, and to analyze.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented web scraping to gather data about hackathons and used esri among other ways to display, visualize, and analyze the data we collected about hackathons.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Esri API was difficult to get used to.
There is not a lot of data out there about hackathon that is easily accessible - we relied on web scraping in order to get the data we needed.

                    We scraped a lot of data off mlh.io and devpost.
