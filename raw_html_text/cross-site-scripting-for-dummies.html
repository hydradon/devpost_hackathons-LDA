                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to build something to give back to the security community. This was the solution that we came up with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It automatically detects XSS vulnerabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Puppeteer to automatically browse to a webpage and insert a payload. It would then detect the XSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with a new technology comes with many challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is functional! Woo!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of JavaScript, MySQL, Github, and Puppeteer (of course).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cross Site Scripting for Dummies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll add in some additional checks to prune out false positives.
