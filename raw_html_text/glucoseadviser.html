                    Methodology
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using anonymized data from Johnson and Johnson with both the
blood glucose level of patients and when they ate and how many carbohydrates their meal had,
I implemented a predictive algorithm to help patients discern a safe amount of carbohydrates 
to eat at each meal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Data Creation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was not without its technical challenges, however. One of the biggest challenges was the 
lack of direct cohesion between the food data and the blood glucose data. To generate a training set,
I iterated through all of the food data points and found the two nearest blood glucose measurements before 
and after eating. I found it to be a reasonable assumption to assume linear increase or decrease of 
blood glucose levels over time, so calculated the change in glucose per minute by calculating
                    <code>
                        (glucoseValue1 - glucoseValue2) / time elapsed glucoseValue1 and glucoseValue2
                    </code>
                    where glucoseValue1 is the glucose 
reading nearest after eating, and glucoseValue2 is the glucose reading nearest before eating.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Download the repository and install the required libraries with
                    <code>
                        pip install -r requirements.txt
                    </code>
                    . 
Adjust the paths to the data files if necessary. To run the script, simply execute
                    <code>
                        python glucoseAdviser.py
                    </code>
