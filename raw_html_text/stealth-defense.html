                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was the ongoing sex trafficking problem bombarding our country. We wanted to create a company that used this idea as our prime motivation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create product(s) that helped people when they get into dangerous situations. These products would take into consideration the movements that you would have if you are getting attacked. The products are tailored to help quickly access tools in times of distress. With the help of hidden pockets, detachable pieces, GPS trackers, and other small tools there garments should have viable uses in the real world for anyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We constructed these pieces keeping in mind what a person would have quick access to when needed. The assembly of these garments were carefully thought out to include features that normal clothing does not include. The coat has a feature where the para cord holding the seams together can be easily undone so if you are grabbed the clothing pieces can slip off leaving the attacker with a handful of fabric. The chest bag has detachable pieces that work in a similar way when an attacker is grabbing you or your things. The cocktail dress has a GPS tracker and sensor that when tapped can send an SOS message to your emergency contacts or 911 depending on what you have set up. This feature would be activated with the partnership of a phone company in order to use their towers. In addition the joggers have a comparable technology in them with the GPS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some challenges when coming up with features that would be useful in a situation like being attacked. We acted our situations to test each other and figure out what is needed in a garment. We wanted to make it useful not just hypothetical. The garments needed to be able to stand on their own but have enough features to make this idea stand out and be wanted by the public. Another obstacle was figuring out how the GPS system would work and useful places to store it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team we created four different garments and that in itself is a big accomplishment for us. We each made something entirely different with varied features added to the garments. This idea we were excited about and were able to quickly get our idea from paper to reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making clothing is easy but thinking about the problems in our society and trying to find ways to solve them through clothing is not. We really had to put our minds together to effectively think of a likable idea that could help solve an issue even if it only helps a bit. We are only four people but we have the power to make a change and that change starts with our decisions in the studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stealth Defense
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully our idea can turn into a bigger reality then just us four as a group. We feel like this could be a useful product to offer to the public in order to protect us with things we wear and use everyday.
