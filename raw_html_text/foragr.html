                </h2>
                <p>
                    I live in my car. It's a prius. Before I moved in, I did a lot of research. I found out about the VanLife community. Those are people who live in their vans full time.

                    They tend to stick to cities for around a month each. Although some of them prefer remote work (called Digital Nomads), most prefer in person short-term gigs. Craigslist allows one to search for gigs, but only in one city at a time.

                    This makes it hard to plan where to live next.
