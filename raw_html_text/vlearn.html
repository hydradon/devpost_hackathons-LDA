                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking Augemented Reality to Education, to help young students decide if they&acute;re interested in technology

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It&acute;s an app where you see a landing menu and the app tells you it&acute;s about to give you a tour to technology. It activates your main camera and you have to show a QR code, the app detects it and displays an augmented reality character, the first one is a robot, it explains hardware, the second one is a computer, it explains software and the last one is a robotic hand, it explains mechanics.
