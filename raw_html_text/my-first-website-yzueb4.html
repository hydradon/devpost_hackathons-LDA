                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a beginner at everything software related, so I wanted to learn more. I started with Web Developing.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website is just an attempt at humor made with the html and css I learned. I hope you enjoy it!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I spent most of my time learning how to code it, but I eventually downloaded Visual Studio Code and got to work. I used html, and some (quite riotous, frankly) css to get the job done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning, definitely, was the biggest challenge. I struggled to remember what tags are for what purpose, and what to edit out of my code. Another challenge, however, was securing the connection between my code and the browser it was appearing in, which was the website itself. It refused to refresh and add what I had edited onto the page, which ate up some time when I tried to fix the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made my first website! I learned the very basics of html and css, and although others may not think so, I perceive my website as one of the most beautiful pieces of internet in existence, if only for the special place it holds in my heart.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As I mentioned before, I learned html in the sense that I can now procure tags to edit text create titles, paragraphs, different fonts and sizes, and so on. I learned css to add some color and life to the page, as unruly as it may be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My First Website
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am definitely going to keep working on this website to expand it and make in the best it can be. To do this, admittedly, I may need to change the topic. For the next hackathon, however, I will be exploring another branch of software. Thank you for this learning opportunity!
