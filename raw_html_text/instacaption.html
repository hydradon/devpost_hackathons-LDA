                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever have trouble coming up with captions for your Instagram post? How many hours have you spent just thinking of that perfect, witty caption? All of us on the InstaCaption team have run into this problem, and we know countless of our friends and family have as well.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With InstaCaption, you'll never have to ponder over captions again. This web application generates Instagram captions in the form of song lyrics. It analyzes a given photo and, based on the photo's content, will generate applicable captions. It gives a variety of options so that you can choose the lyrics that you like best.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We primarily used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Clarifai API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us had limited experience with JavaScript, so that was a big learning curve. It also took time to look into and learn about the Clarifi API.

                    We want to expand in the future to Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat. Soon we'll be helping people create cool captions all over the internet. :)
