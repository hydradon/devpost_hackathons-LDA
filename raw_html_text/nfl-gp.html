                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial idea came from the recent events of the NFL playoffs. We are seeing so many surprising upsets between lower/statistically weaker teams and better/statistically stronger teams
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The webapp takes in the names of two teams and gives an approximate score and who will win depending on our parameters/data points we chose to prioritize
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first wrote a python command line app that just takes in the team names. Since the nature of our app is fairly simple, we used a simple template for the front end that is still relatively elegant. Then to join the frontend and backend together, we used Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble coming up with an interesting algorithm to predict. We wanted it to be fun, but also not be completely ridiculous.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the least problems and issues we've ran into so far when working with Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time that we've really dived into looking at football advanced stats and using data to create and algorithm based on certain trends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NFL-GP
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can try using machine learning and using more data points to create a new algorithm that is more accurate. However, we realize that the predictions can only be so accurate due to some chance occurrences and the ever changing rosters on football teams
