                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For an English project we had to find a way video games could be beneficial to the player's health. Through sources such as Daphne Bavelier&rsquo;s TED Talk &ldquo;Your brain on video games&rdquo; we found that fast-paced video games can improve the ability to concentrate and boost the players decision-making process. Since doing this English project we have been developing the idea for Galaxy Pong, without any time to actually make it, so this hackathon became the perfect time to create a demo for our game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a fast-paced mobile game that took influence from one of the first video games: Pong. It is similar in the way that you are bouncing a ball around the screen with paddles but in Galaxy Pong, you are not limited to vertical movement, you have to avoid hitting all borders of the screen, and you have to think about the angles you use because you have to set it up for yourself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity with Visual Studios for all of the coding in our game, however, since we are quite inexperienced we had to rely heavily on tutorials and Unity's scrip reference site. We are very proud to say that all of our assets are made by us using tools like google drawings on google drive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we were developing this idea for a long time we had more ideas than time to complete them making it a constant debate on what we should prioritize and finish for the demo. Our inexperience with many of the concepts we had for the game was a harsh reality check for us and going back and forth between sprite designs due to group member disagreements and changing our minds took a significant amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new features of Unity is something we are quite proud of because we plan on furthering our knowledge on the subject and making more games with it. Making the game compatible with multiple resolutions is our greatest accomplishment in our opinions because at EC Hacks (the previous hackathon we went to together) we were struggling with the resolution and even though we spent many hours on the problem we were unable to solve it. Being able to solve that problem makes us very proud of our work at this hackathon. Last but not least we are very proud to have made all of the assets used our game. We think that this is one of the most important things about making a game because the characters and assets of a game typically become the most memorable parts of a game like Pac-man and Mario.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt our current capabilities with unity and found many good sources of unity knowledge which we can use to further our game development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Galaxy Pong
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We still plan on adding many of the features that we were unable to add due to time restraints and our current capabilities. Features like more game modes, multiplayer, and improvements to the current game mechanics.
