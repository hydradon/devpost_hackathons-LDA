                    AcceptMe is a web and iPhone application that we created to help high school students organize their college deadlines with ease. As each student will sign up and log in, they will be able to add schools to their list, and specify which type of decision (i.e Early Decision, Regular Decision, etc.), which application type, and more. Through this students will be able to keep track of their deadlines and requirements and stay on top of the college application process.
