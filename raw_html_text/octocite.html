                    We've all written papers and have had to compile a list of

                    This is a web-application designed to help cite sources better than Citation Machine, Easy Bib and other such websites, because sometimes they just don&rsquo;t work, and they are not as simple to use. It follows the MLA, APA, and Chicago style formats.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed the backend on Django and the frontend using Angular 2. We had to learn both of the frameworks since none of us had prior experience with either of them.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems with the backend and had to scrap user databases (storing of previous citations). It was hard to integrate Django with Angular 2, especially because they both have templates and can collide.

                <p>
                    We're proud of troubleshooting most of our problems and finishing a pretty decent project. We also accomplished learning new frameworks and setting those up in a limited amount of time. Finally, we were able to focus on working when it came down to it and we learned a lot about developing web applications. For a first-time hackathon project we feel we created something awesome!
