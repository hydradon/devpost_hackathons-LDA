                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Something that we've personally wanted to do was journalling, however it was always tedious to grab out a notebook, sit down, and start writing. Not only did I need to make the time and place, sometimes I would have difficulty knowing about what to write. However, we always find texting easy and fun, so we decided to try combine journalling and texting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coquina gives you a daily journalling prompt and reminder, helping you to write more often and more focused. It also keeps entries as simple as you want them by using a text-like format, conducive for short and longer messages. Finally, a small chat assistant helps give prompt replies and subtle encouragement for better journalling.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using React Native and the Expo XDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React Native is very different from what we're used to, and was at times difficult trying to wrap our heads around. A lot of problems came up in how information flow worked and how we were supposed to manipulate it.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making our first mobile app on iOS and learning the ropes of React Native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile apps take a bit of magic and delicacy to get just right, otherwise the whole feel can be ruined. Coming from a more web-oriented background, we feel that web development can be far more lenient and generous in terms of design and also online support.

                    What's next for Coquina
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a main menu, adding more chat functionality for the chat assistant, and the option to take a picture for a journal entry.
