                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build something using Loopring Protocol. Their protocol can allow users to engage in orders that are filled in a circular fashion. This tool provides better liquidity and a lot of potential for arbitrage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the protocol's smart contracts, we built a wallet that allows users to engage in p2p transactions. This can be extended to utilize the full power of their ring matching smart contracts to allow a circular matching of orders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We connected our computers using port forwarding, and forwarded this to our phones. Then using the Loopring protocol, we executed p2p transactions. These transactions were triggered by generating/scanning QR codes on our phones.

                <p>
                    This can be extended by using NFC technology to execute this transaction. We could have also used the full potential of Looprings circular transactions by allowing a group of people to use this to execute all their transactions in a circle.
