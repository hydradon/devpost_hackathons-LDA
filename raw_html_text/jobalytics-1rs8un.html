                    <strong>
                        Did you know that on average recruiters spend JUST 6 seconds looking at your resume?
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As university students, we understand the challenge of creating a resume and gaining objective insight on what works and what doesn't BEFORE it's too late. Resumes are often the first time a recruiter is made aware of your interest in the position, so it needs to be perfect. We set out to make a project that runs standalone and gives users the potential to evaluate their resumes from the lens of an objective, learning computer.

                <p>
                    The web front-end was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript/JQuery with some formatting help from Bootstrap.

                <p>
                    Node.js was the server side language running on a Express.JS server.

                <p>
                    Wolfram One/Mathematica was used with Indico for the analytical machinel earning and NLP back-end of the program, executed in Python, which was then ported into Node with python shell.
