                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to transmit the feeling of excitement you get when you get on a cruiser for the first time, so you can decide whether or not the experience is for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It&acute;s a system that simulates thru virtual reality the whole experience of being on a cruiser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Virtual reality as our prime focus, utilizing Unity to allow us to make the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not know how to use Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to properly use Unity in less than 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VR and Unity.
                </p>

                    What's next for Cruiser-VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were to win this hackathon we would love to continue the whole idea and sharpen it up so that it actually finds its desired use.
