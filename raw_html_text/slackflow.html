                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    I'm a huge chatbot and voice assistant app developer, so I browse Google's Dialogflow product
                    <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/dialogflow/dVIdVjmlcxY;context-place=topicsearchin/dialogflow/analytics" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    everyday to help other developers as well as find useful things for myself. After seeing 10 posts about wanting their to be an API to grab the Analytics data, I decided to reverse engineer how Dialogflow's analytics page was working and hence Slackflow and Flowlytics was born.

                    library as a wrapper for the unpublished Dialogflow Analytics API so all you need to do is provide your headers and slack tokens in order to grab that data and get it into Slack. If you just want the data, head over to

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to get a refresh token or jumping through Google Auth is incredibly hard and I ended up having to ditch it and focused my efforts on making this as user friendly as possible for another developer to come help with that in the future. I also learned that Promises and callbacks together get's really sketchy and weird
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Slackflow and Flowlytics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing I'd do for Flowlytics is try and figure out how to automate refreshing the tokens from Dialogflow so you're not having to grab that token every 7 days. For Slackflow I'd add slash commands and events so users have more power for specifying the data and time frame they want without having to be a developer
