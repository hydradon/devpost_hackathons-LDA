                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that will promote having good health and encourage people to stay in shape.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to take a picture of themselves or anyone else, have the application tell you what body type the individual in the picture is and receive helpful tips based on that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trained a model with images of different body types of men and women using Clarifai's API. Swift was used to create the front-end of the iOS call and make a call to the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble making the API call from within Swift, so a long time was taken to resolve that issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    We're proud of learning about Clarifai's API because it a very well done and useful API
