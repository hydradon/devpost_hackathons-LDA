                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was first introduced to market making through the Financial Engineering Club at the University of Illinois. The great part about it was that it was awesome. The bad part about it was that it was "open outcry." You literally had to shout out your orders and manually record them. Confusion often arose for us novices. This inspired me to automate that process. I hope that this website will teach aspiring financial engineers and investors the concept of market making.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Orders are placed on a bid-ask spread. In this case, the minimum spread is 2 points. If you place an order, you have no control over whether you will buy or sell a stock. If you accept an offer, you'll have to suffer a slightly disadvantageous price, but you'll have control over your position. The objective of this game is to gain as much profit as well as to maintain a position close to zero. Keep in mind that you
                    <em>
                        will
                    </em>
                    be penalized by the tune of 2 points per position if you don't do so.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Configuring the server took up the majority of the hackathon. We didn't get as many features as we wanted up because we underestimated the scale of the project. In fact, we didn't even code the game engine itself until the second night.
