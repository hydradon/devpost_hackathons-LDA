                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Want to give a high-five to yourself in a picture, but you know nothing about Photoshop? PiCo comes to the rescue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By only using three simple taps, as an intuitive iOS camera app, PiCo allows you to combine pictures creatively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The screen is split into two parts. Take one part of the photo first, and then take the other part, and you will get a combined picture in an instant. Also, you can save your picture to your photo library and post it to your favorite social media.
                </p>

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using Swift to build PiCo and are mainly using its AVFoundation framework to customize our camera.
                </p>

                            Utilized iOS AVFoundation framework to customize device camera into 2 parts.

                            Design the layer and set their constrains so that they can fit any device.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made it as what we initially want it to be!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time to attend Hackathon, we got almost nothing about iOS development. Through straight 24 hours hack, we did learn a lot.
                </p>

                    What's next for PiCo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can figure out many other combination styles. More further, we could add some social function which not only combine pictures but also connect people!
