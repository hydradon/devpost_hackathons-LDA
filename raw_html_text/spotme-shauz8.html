                    It&rsquo;s finally here&hellip;SpotMe: a fitness app that can get you paired up with a workout partner on campus! Many of us have trouble with maintaining an adequate commitment level to getting the exercise that we need. Simply put, it&rsquo;s tough to consistently maintain a workout routine on your own. Nathan came up with this idea last summer after successfully working out with a friend five days a week for three months. When his friend departed for a month-long vacation, Nathan was left to exercise on his own. That first workout felt twice as long and twice as tough, and he realized in that moment that he would rather workout with almost anyone than do this on his own again. Ultimately, life got in the way and he quickly began to lose my routine, realizing that he was so dedicated to when he had a partner. And after much research and real interviews with students and classes at UCLA, Nathan learned two things: most people would love to have a workout partner, and 75% of students aren&rsquo;t getting more than 30 minutes of exercise daily. While that number may seem shocking at first, those familiar with the struggles of getting in shape on your own might not be so surprised.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution to this problem is to help you find workout partners that fit with your needs, goals, and schedule, something that is extremely difficult to do on your own. Without knowing someone in your circle who meets those criteria, it&rsquo;s impossible to find someone unless you&rsquo;re willing to ask strangers to be your workout partner. Like a Tinder for finding a workout partner, SpotMe allows its suers to find a workout partner instantly, or schedule a workout in the future. The app will also host events such as runs around campus or soccer games, using its ability to connect users to get them more active. Ultimately, we seek to become a platform to connect users with the rest of the fitness world, including influencers who provide workouts and inspiration, and companies such as local restaurants who might help support users on their journey to leading a healthier lifestyle.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the ionic framework to create a mobile app for all mobile platforms utilizing JavaScript, .

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The journey to building SpotMe has been difficult, as it was built part-time alongside commitments to graduating, getting jobs, and more. Most recently, we experienced difficulties with data access. Timing was also an issue, because we needed enough time to build a good beta and enough time on the brief 10-week quarter system to release it and gain momentum. Furthermore, friends and colleagues would love the idea, but also mention that there were similar apps that tried to do this and failed.

                    We have completed the user interface and have found a following that would allow us to grow our app.

                <p>
                    Completion of the backend and rollout of the application. We have planned a strategy to acquire users that we will be employing upon launch at the end of summer and that I think will be the differentiating factor. We&rsquo;ll be continuing to improve and develop the SpotMe beta with eyes on that Fall 2017 launch, and make sure that we are 100% prepared on both the technical and marketing end to acquire the users that we need to succeed.
