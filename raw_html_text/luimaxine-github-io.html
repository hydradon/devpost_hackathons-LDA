                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program is dedicated to all the nerdy programmers of the world who suffer from extreme social isolation due to going to too many Hackathons. We hope that this program will help them realize love is closer than they think.

                <p>
                    This app will help programmers discover their one and only soulmate through the analysis of their favorite programming language, gender, and a "little bit" of randomization here at Wilhacks.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We systematically split the work into specific roles based on our strengths. There was a planner, a researcher, and 2 coders. We coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript  and used Codepen.io, Cloud9, GitHub, and Caret to build our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many different challenges that we ran into. We worked with Javascript, GitHub, and Cloud9 for the first time this weekend, which presented many hardships, such as trouble identifying errors and coordinating tasks between team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website that works! We also built the website out of scratch, meaning that we did not use an online template of any kind and did our very best to not plagiarize. Our team bond grew stronger as we coded throughout the night and gained confidence in our work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't be afraid to ask for help! We constantly asked Max and Patrick (mentors) for advice and help on our code. They helped us immensely and we wouldn't have finished without them. We also learned more about our team members, like their goals and dreams, and we saw how each member worked hard, drinking coffee at 3 am to continue coding. We also met many other amazing attendees at Wilhacks, who are experienced and passionate about Hackathons, which made us very interested and motivated in continuing our fire for code!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to present our work to our AP Computer Science Class and inspire those students that under a limited time, you can make something incredible through the power of teamwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At our next Hackathon, we'd like to try turning this same concept into an app!
