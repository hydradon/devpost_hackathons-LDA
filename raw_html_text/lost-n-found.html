                <p>
                    Stuffs get lost so easily, especially when at home. You know it's in the room, but you just can't find it. Isn't it annoying when you are heading out but you cannot find your keys? Isn't it disappointing when you finally finish your day but you don't know where your iPad is?

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with two major tools: Tensorflow object detection API and OpenCV feature matching algorithm. Combining the two, we achieved accurate object tracking and recording with minimum call to Tensorflow's API.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hard to build environment due to inconsistency between operating system and library function.

                    <li>
                        Implement active tracking, so that user can specify what to track and tell Item Tracker what was missing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Integrate with Alexa so that user can find stuff by (imagine you lost your phone and can't reach Item Tracker...how do you find it)
