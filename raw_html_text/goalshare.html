                <p>
                    Keeps a running list of goals a user sets. Logging the title of the goal, who or what the goal is for, and a description of the goal. There is also a box the user can check when they have completed the goal.
                </p>

                    How I built it

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the longest time the list of goals wasn't showing up and I tried countless ways to use an Adapter to display the ListView. I finally figured out that each time I clicked a button a new activity was started instead of returning to the original one.

                <p>
                    I want to be able to connect the app to a database so that users can make certain goals public and other users can support their goals and encourage or join them.
