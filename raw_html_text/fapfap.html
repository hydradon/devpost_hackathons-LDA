                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We as, computer scientists,  know everything there is to know about the troubles interacting with new people and, even harder, trying to flirt with other people. Therefore the idea of creating a pick up line generator with a front-end page and the possibility of installing a chrome extension such that you always have a smart and clever pickup line near you was what we focused on during this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fapfap generator has a large collection of already existing lines where it uses neural networks to generate even better pickup lines for you - helping you find love.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web-server is written in Python using Flask and the neural network is also written in python with web-scraaping scripts and use of keras-lib. The chrome extension is written in .js and uses HTML and CSS.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The chrome extension was a bit difficult to make since we had to learn about how it works since it does not directly interacts with the DOM, but lies embedded within the browser. So special cases of getting different elements was  at occasions troublesome.
The machine learning part had some troubles with installing and utilizing CUDA.
