                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AR is the future of mobile gaming, and we wanted to build on the revolutionary experiences available aplenty on the app store. So, we built the world's first real-time multiplayer AR experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take Call of Duty: Zombies. Now, put it on your phone. Cool right? Imagine if instead of boring 3D worlds and touch controls however, you were
                    <em>
                        actually
                    </em>
                    traversing the battlefield, fighting for survival with all of your friends. Although it's a little tough to verbalise, we think our video demo below will help clarify how cool of an experience it actually is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use ARKit for VIO, SceneKit for object rendering, and are integrating automated occlusion via a CNN (SegNet) in CoreML. Socket.IO and Node.js take care of the real-time object transmission and inter-device awesomeness. The rest is in the hands of the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was
                    <strong>
                        very
                    </strong>
                    frustrating to design efficient communications structures to allow for optimal cross-platform object encoding. SwiftyJSON came to the rescue, but we would like to expand further by implementing more sophisticated custom objects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While there's definitely a lot of room for improvement, we are absolutely ecstatic at the fact that we managed to build a convincing shared-dimension experience. We're also really proud of the theoretical maximum of 50 nodes with our current setup, as this encourages us to take our idea into practice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt that planning is absolutely pivotal, especially in a 24-hour crunch such as hacknroll. Hydration and sleep are key, and frequent sanity checks and tests prevent the buildup of pressure for last-minute debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AU - Real-time multiplayer AR experience for iOS
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to refine the experience and implement high-performance automated occlusion, then push it to the iOS App Store to receive feedback and suggestions for other experiences we could create.
