                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to created an App that lower percentage of car accident
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using muse to detect brain wave data, we are able to identify whether a driver is falling a sleep or not base on the algorithm we designed. The app on Android can alert the driver to prevent the driver from falling asleep. If the driver does not response in time, the app will automatically send location to the emergency contact so driver's relatives can knows the driver falling asleep.
                </p>

                    The Challenges we ran into is to pair with the muse.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted more time to work on a better user interface, use cloud api to send sms message as well as alert emergency contact when there is a car accident happen to the driver.
