                        RAPPLE is a modular system consisting of the following building blocks:
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Speech Recognition by Microsoft Cognitive Services (transforms input rap audio signal to text)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Punch line generator (generates an appropriate response and outputs it as text)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Text-to-Speech by Microsoft Cognitive Services (transforms the text to a speech signal)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Speech-to-Rap (imposes rhythmic structure on the speech signal to make it groovy and fit it on the beat)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Output the punch line(s) as audio
