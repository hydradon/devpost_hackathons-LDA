                    Inspiration- The initial project idea was based on slight annoyances within our lives, mainly the ordeal of having to search up ETS schedules each time needed to use transit.

                <h2>
                    What we does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although different from our original idea we developed an app which could identify your exact location and display random locations within the world.

                    What this falls under
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android apps, built using android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to build the app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Merging conflicts, using google API keys, and user input from EditText.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to make GUI's or splash screens for the app, developing an app that worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned to use GitHub, and basic actions within android studio.
                </p>

                    What's next for OctoMap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we continue on this project we'd like to finish the initial idea which consisted of an app able to design a transit route for each event in your calendar. Example: Violin practice at 5 PM, the app would display a notification at the time of departure and give directions for transit/car (based on user choice) eventually leading them to the session. This eliminates the need to search up transit schedules on ETS Trip Planner.
