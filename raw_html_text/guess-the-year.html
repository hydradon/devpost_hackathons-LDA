                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found inspiration for Guess The Year when I saw a post on Instagram that said
                    <em>
                        "These songs are 10 years old."
                    </em>
                    This gave me the idea that it could make a great trivia game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Guess the Year is a trivia game where you need to guess the year of when certain things happened. When the game first starts, the player will need to guess the year the song was released. They are presented with 4 options to choose from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a single-player game, 10 questions are asked. For every correct answer, a point is won.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a 2 player game, both players go head to head and will be asked 5 questions each. Each question is worth a certain amount of points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Question 1 &amp; 2 = 1 point
Question 3 &amp; 4 = 2 points
Question 5 &amp; 6 = 3 points
Question 7 &amp; 8 = 4 points
Question 9 &amp; 10 = 5 points
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a 3 or 4 player game, it all comes down to the last person standing. If a player gets the question wrong, the player is out. However, the 3 or 4 player game is only available to those with the All Access subscription.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The All Access subscription gives the user access to more topics: movies, general knowledge, tv, sports, art, literature and business. They also get more music questions and the ability to see their rankings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I developed Guess the Year using the ASK-CLI, Alexa SDK, AWS Lambda, S3 Bucket, DynamoDB, Alexa Presentation Language and Node.JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a very content-heavy skill, that required a lot of time. I had a lot of research to do for each category. I also had to make up a lot of wrong convincing answers for hundreds of questions for the players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another Challenge was including the APL. I had to really push myself as designing is not my speciality. I was reading the documentation on how to apply certain APL features such as Touch Wrappers. I really wanted to make it visually appealing and it took time creating the 11 screens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was really proud of how I integrated APL into this skill. I really wanted to make this strong visually and I think the time spent on this skill truly shows. I don't think I've ever had to invest that much time in content for a skill before but I believe content is the key for a premium experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Guess the Year has allowed me to experiment more with APL and become more comfortable with it. I now actively apply APL into all my present and future skills which was something I was hesitant to do before.
                </p>
