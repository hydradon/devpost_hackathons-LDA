                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard to truly figure out what salary you'll be receiving after tax when you start your full time job. Between state taxes and federal taxes, it's hard to estimate what your take-home will look like. It's even harder to compare two different offers across two different cities in different countries, since the tax rates would be different for all of them!
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our tool allows you to enter different cities, different salaries, and compare your take-home after-tax paycheck in these cities. This helps you make the best judgement in which offer to accept.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a web tool using vanilla javascript and HTML that allows this cross-currency cross-country cross-jurisdiction salary comparison. We used bootstrap for basic styling.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge is writing the logic for tax calculations and making sure it's scalable for different currencies and tax arrangements
