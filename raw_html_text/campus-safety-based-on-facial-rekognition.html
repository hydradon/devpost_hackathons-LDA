                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lately, there have been few suspicious activities that have been reported in or around the campus and that's why we wanted to create a project that will help us to make the campus safer, catching the suspect quickly using live video stream and facial recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to capture live video streams from the surveillance cameras, recognize the suspects using the AWS platform and its APIs to report the last seen location of the suspect. This will provide aid to the authorities in concern to track the activities of the suspect as well as can be used to warn the citizens to be more alert.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used AWS kinesis live video stream, signal handlers to take input from cameras, lamda, and rekognition for image identification. Using S3 for storage of data.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration of all the components involved in the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learned AWS features and the power of its libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Campus safety based on facial recognition
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it as a fully integrated product and scaling it into the pool of a large number of universities. Also, adding some new features that will show the geographical heatmap, crime rate, etc.
