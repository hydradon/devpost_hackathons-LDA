                    This was an opportunity to explore shared Augmented reality experiences. Right now this is an early concept demo. It shows the fun of doing battle with &ldquo;drones&rdquo; indoors&mdash; something they would never actually let us do.
The biggest challenge in shared Augmented reality is sharing the virtual part in a robust and accurate way. There were many subtle problems just getting a couple of HoloLenses to connect!
We were able to get them connected and enable controller assisted virtual combat in the real world.
