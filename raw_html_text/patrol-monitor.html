                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout my life, I saw and heard of many crimes, without police being in the right moment at the right time. How does this happen? They fail to pass through every street and so some streets get completely neglected by the police. I want to both ensure the safety of the tax paying citizens and also use modern technology to help officers manage their work more efficiently. I did market research with real officers to ensure there is a need for this.

                <p>
                    The software monitors and registers police patrol activity and suggests routes and frequency of future routines.
