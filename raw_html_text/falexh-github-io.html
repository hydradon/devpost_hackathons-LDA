                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration was the amazing cats that are able to jump very high.
Also, all of the tutorials by Shiffman on Youtube for p5.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows a user to click a box and add randomized cats!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Javascript + p5, as well as HTML and some CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The cats images had to be adjusted a few times. As well as the mass of each object.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that I got multiple cats to bounce in a box!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That working with cats can be frustrating.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Updates! This is only the start of the bounce house. There will be new modes coming soon!
