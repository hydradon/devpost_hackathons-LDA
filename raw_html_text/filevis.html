                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I choose this project because it is related to the cyber security challenge and the visualization challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app would be able to let user create segments within a binary file and choose their decoding method, making reverse engineering a binary file format easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it with Vue.js for the UI, and uses webpack for new javascript features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building the UI is a lots of challenge. I took too much time just fixing some white space on the page that I didn't get to finish the actual features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not really getting much done, but this is one of the biggest web UI project I have attempted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned reactive programming with the Vue.js framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FileVIs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is not done. Most of the features are not done. I need to implement creating file segments, decoding algorithms, search features, etc.
