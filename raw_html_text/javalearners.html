                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with this idea, because two of the people in our group didn't know how to use Java and this was a way to teach them the basics of how it works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its an application that takes users through the Java programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by using JavaFX and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many problems, but the two main ones were how to change scenes and how to run and compile the code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the progress we made with the certain amount of time and learning JavaFX from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two of the people in our group learned the basics of Java and the other two learned how to use JavaFX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JavaLearners
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to expand the amount of lessons and at sometime we might add a test that reviews the lessons.
