                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by open world adventure games and real world scavenger hunts. We decided to combine the two and create this game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game where the player wanders through the forest searching for various times using riddles as clues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the main game using Unity. The models were created in SketchUp and the music was composed in NoteFlight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges using the colliders and while designing the compass tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of the compass and the music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about GUI's in Unity and just overall ease of use in the engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Adventure Hunt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding different scenes with different scavengers hunts to explore.
