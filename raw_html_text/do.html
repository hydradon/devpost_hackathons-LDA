                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every student has faced the problem of procrastination. We wanted something that would help us organize our time efficiently. This inspired us to build
                    <em>
                        do
                    </em>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        do
                    </em>
                    takes all of your assignments and ranks them based on assignment type and due date. Assignments are then queued in an intuitive way to help you focus on what you need to get done now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started drawing out ideas on paper in order to focus on logistics and UX/UI. From there we made mockup pages with the use of Bootstrap 4. We then planned out how we would template the site with the use of Jinja2. Finally, we implemented routing and logic code with Flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bootstrap 4 is still in alpha, so, naturally, we faced some strange bugs along the way. Luckily we were able to include some small CSS hacks to make up for the fact. Approaching UI was also difficult, so we spent a lot of time getting it just right. This included creating multiple mockups on paper before writing any code at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were not very familiar with Flask, so learning how to use Jinja2 along with Flask's routing was somewhat of a challenge. We also didn't know how Flask organized static files which meant many small changes to make sure CSS, fonts, and images were linked correctly.
                </p>
