                    Inspiration: Too many insurance companies can inundate someone who is new to buying their own insurance, so finding the best company for them at the cheapest rate can be a lifesaver. There was also no app that did anything like this.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Our software uses a multidimensional array to store the top insurance companies and multiple sets of data about them to run trial cases from the users' responses that will present them with the best insurance opportunity for them.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: Three of our team members scoured the internet to research the main demographics that affect quality of insurance policy. These were then converted into questions that we presented to the user in order to get those data from them. Additionally, we researched what types of insurance policies there were and what companies offered benefits for being part of certain insurances. These were then converted into additional questions so that we can narrow down the result to one insurance company for the user. I translated these questions into Swift so that the full frontend of the application can be seen how the user would see it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: By far the biggest challenge we faced was ideating and eventually settling on this final idea. We had way too many ideas and critiqued them way too soon, such that we got to the point where every idea seemed terrible - we got too used to finding flaws. We finally set this detrimental behavior aside such that we would be able to formulate an idea and actually get started creating it. Our ideation phase should have been 1-2 hours. Instead, it was around 12-13.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: We were surprisingly talented at critiquing ideas despite the fact that it set us back. We were able to see the full picture of every problem that we were aiming to solve, and saw that a single software idea made at that time would not be sufficient. Additionally, we are very proud of our team dynamic. What would have been a yell fest with other less coordinated and driven teams, we instead were surprisingly calm even at the most frustrating of times.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: We learned that even though our brainstorming session involved deleting ideas, we have to persevere and go the extra step to get the idea out.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for InsuraFit: Adding more types of insurance such as auto, home, life, etc. Transforming our model from an array based system to a web scraping system. This will allow the lesser known companies to also be considered for the prospective insurance buyer.
