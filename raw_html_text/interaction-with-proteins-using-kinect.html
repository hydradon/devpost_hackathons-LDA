                    So, I really wanted make people understand how atoms in a protein react like they do. 
Nothing yet
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made it by updating and modifying old protein simulation libraries in Unity, and adapting them to use them to my need, then adding a script to integrate it with Kinect
                </p>
                <p>
                    By far the biggest challenge was integration of unity and kinect in a way that it works.
                    <br>
                    I learned about basic transformations in unity, and a LOT of C# though.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After figuring out kinect entirely, I would like to share it with original authors, and propose it to teachers and professors around the world.
