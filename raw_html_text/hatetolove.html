                    Children need some motivation to learn. These days their attention span has become shorter than of a goldfish. So to make them learn really boring things like spellings or new words becomes difficult. What do kids love the most? Playing games! Video games, games in apps, board games - anything that is fun!
We thought why not make this learning experience fun as well? Integrate education with something fun like a game.
You start with one level consisting of words of a particular size. And you are given a goal word to reach. By changing one letter at a time, which still makes a meaningful word, the user has to reach the goal word. An image of the word is given too. And user can request a definition or a picture hint as well.
