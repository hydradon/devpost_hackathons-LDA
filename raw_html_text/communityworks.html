                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created CommunityWorks with a vision for healthier, cleaner, and more connected communities with the use of technology. With CommunityWorks, the goverment, HOA's, and members of the community are able to track the municipal issues that often go ignored but pose as every-day risks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user is able to input a municipal issue they see - from broken traffic lights, to roadkill, to need for sidewalk pavement. Users upload images and descriptions of the incident. The reported issues are then geo-tagged on a Google Map. On the app, members of the community are able to view the issues geo-tagged around their community. Accuracy of the app is maintained by confirmation - users are able to confirm a problem or its resolution. In cleaning up the problem, the app allows potential volunteer efforts to become organized and address the issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application's front page is based in HTML/CSS and Javascript, using the Google Maps API for the map view. Inputted data is stored in a SQL database using PHP and MySQL. We used Bootstrap for design and formatting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connection to the database and extraction of data posed as challenges and opportunities to learn for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole application!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CommunityWorks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to build upon the last volunteer organization component.
