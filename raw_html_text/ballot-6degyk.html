                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed this website to correct the imbalance between the attention given to the federal government, while the local government gets ignored. The news cycle always focuses on federal news, even the local channels. There is barely any coverage on it, which leaves the majority of voters massively uninformed. Local Election voter turnout can be as low as 22.5%. We wanted to bring attention to the election of these small offices. While the Presidential and Congressional elections are vital, local elections are just as important, especially when it comes to an individual making a change in his or her community. Change takes place from the bottom up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can check when upcoming elections are, current representatives, and where the closest voting center is. By spreading this information in a clean and concise way, we hope to be able to attract a larger amount of voters to really engage in their civic duty.
