                    Inspiration: Had to find a way to make things easy for people to book online, specifically for elderly people and the careless ones.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Has a very simple UI which books tickets for movies, flights etc by doing the majority of the work for you while giving proper feedback before submitting.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: Used Java and only Java. Nothing more, nothing less. Add a sleepless night to the recipe and voila, EZSherpa is born.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Getting the data from the websites we are requesting to.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of : Getting the data from the websites we are requesting to. Also, sticking together while we did it and not lose hope!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: That things are difficult to integrate!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EZSherpa: Well, for starters, a night's sleep! After that, we will carry forward this inspiration and attend more hackathons before starting our own company!
