                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're avid hackers, and every hack we've done thus far has involved hardware. The hardest part is always setting up communication between the various hardware components it's -- like reinventing the internet protocol everytime you make an IoT device. Except the internet protocol is beautiful, and your code is jank. So we decided we'd settle that problem once and for all, both for out future hacks and for hackers in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now, all the code needed for an IoT device is python. You write some python code for your computer, some for the microcontroller, and we seamlessly integrate between them. And we help predict how much better your code base is as a result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Microcontrollers, because they are bare-metal, don't actually run python. So we wrote a python transpiler that automatically converts python code into bare-metal-compliant C code. Then we seamlessly, securely, and efficiently transfer data between the various hardware components using our own channels protocol. The end result is that you only ever need to look at python. Based on that and certain assumptions of usage, we model how much we are able to improve your coding experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to implement a full lexical analyzer in its complex, abstract glory. That was a mistake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because the set of languages described by regex is basically equivalent to the set of all decidable problems in computer science, we used regex in place of the lexical analyzer, which was pretty interesting.
More generally, however, this was a big project with many moving parts, and a large code base. The fact that our team was able to put everything together, get things done, and come up with creative solutions on the fly was fantastic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Organization with tools like trello is important.
Compilers are complex.
Merging disparate pieces of interlocking code is a difficult but rewarding process.
And many miscellaneous python tips and tricks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kharon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to keep updating the project to make it more robust, general, and power. Potential routes for this include more depth in the theory of the field, integrating more AI, or just commenting our code more thoroughly so others can understand it.
This project will be useful to us and other hardware hackers in the future! -- that's why we'll keep working on this :)
