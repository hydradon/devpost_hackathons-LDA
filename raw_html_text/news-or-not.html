                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ads pop out when we are using the Internet. We want to know if that has valuable information for us. That inspires us to do a text classification to determine if one is news or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our algorithm trains 80% of the Brown corpus (contains 500 texts, news and non-news) for text classification. And test on the rest 20% for accuracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implement Naive Bayes Classifier in natural language toolkit to train our designed features
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initial training wasn't good enough. We found out that second-round training based on first-round result improves accuracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reaches 97% accuracy!
                </p>
                <h2>
