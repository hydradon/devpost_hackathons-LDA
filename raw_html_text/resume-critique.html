                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a program for people who don't have access to resume critiquing services, or find themselves in need of immediate critiquing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a .txt file as an input (your resume as an ascii text document), prints it to a GUI, and offers some tips on how to improve it (if necessary)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the javax swing library for most of the GUI components, but did all of the base program (i.e searching the text file) in the console. Program consists of arrays, for loops, and conditionals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult creating a scroll bar (for some reason). Turns out the code was in the wrong place, and now it works perfectly. Being beginner programmers, it was challenging at first to append items to an array of unfixed size. We eventually found the Arrays.asList method, and that made life easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that it outputs exactly what we originally wanted it to output, and that we didn't have to change features about our program due to difficulties we had. Having never worked with GUIs before, we are proud that it is fully functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about GUI, as well as array appending.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Resume Critique
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to be able to list the found resume sections as clickable labels that display a description about the item, and implement a start over button
