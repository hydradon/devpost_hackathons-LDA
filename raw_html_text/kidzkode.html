                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we foresee that programming is eventually going to be one of the most important skills to have so we wanted to help people start learning programming at a young age.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a web app that lets kids easily find other kids who are interested in programming and quiz each other on their programming knowledge. Our web app contains multiple choice quizzes and virtual "rooms" which players can join and play against other people they know. We also implemented a chatroom where players can easily communicate with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, Angular2, and Bootstrap to create a perfectly childish UI. We also used Node for the server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a messy problem with merging all of our files together and making sure they "fit" together. We also struggled with implementing the multiplayer feature and making sure our chatroom worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of what our web app UI, and the fact that it actually works! More importantly, we are very proud to have created our web app despite the sleepiness, the brain farts, and the stress from learning something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely learned more about web development, and improved our technical skills, as well as our teamwork skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for KidzKode
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make the UI for KidzKode a little more cuter and appealing to young children. We'd also like to implement other features like prizes, levels, and profiles.
