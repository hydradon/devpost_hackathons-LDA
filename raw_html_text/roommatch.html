                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes roommate pairings are just not the right fit. Coming into apartments and deciding to room with randoms is really a hit or a miss. A common problem we find students having is waiting for the day they move out so they never have to see their roommate again. Well now, that problem can be solved!

                <p>
                    Our app provides students with the ideal roommate matches! Simply register for an account, fill out a simple survey, and start chatting! Our app lets students view all their matches and swipe on whether or not they think they would be a good fit. Then, the app notifies you when you have a new match! You get the chance to chat with your match and decide if you want to room together!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team decided to use Android Studio to create our app for Android devices. We also used an API called Firebase Authentication Database to secure log-in info and store information about each user. Our front end design was also created in Android Studio using Javascript. Our backend matching program was coded in Java.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some issues with Android Studio. It was really slow sometimes. Sometimes it just broke down completely. We gained a lot of patience this hackathon. Or lost a lot. It's ok, it do be like that sometimes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're really proud of our ability to combine our front end with our back end. It was a rough start at first, thats for sure, but we wanted to produce the best quality content for our users, so we kept working at it until we finally got it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about what it takes to develop apps in Android Studio. Patience. So much patience. Eventually, the program shut down on everyone's computer except for one person in our group, so we all huddled around our friend telling him how to code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RoomMatch
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to include a co-ed option, since that is not a feature we support currently. We also want to eventually split up the profile creation and the roommate quiz. This is because in the future, we thought it would be a cool idea to get a community forum on the app so people would continue to use it even after they had found a roommate. It could link them with study partners in the area, or inform them if a ResLife activity was going on. These could be future advancements to the current set program.
