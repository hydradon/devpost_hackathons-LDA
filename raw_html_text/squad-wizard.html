                    -We ended up manipulating and structuring the given the data quite a lot and spent a lot of time getting it into a understandable form. 
-We were long stuck in getting web technologies and graphics works, as well as formating the data.
                    <br>
                    -We could have planned the schedule better and save some valuable time

                    -Getting interesting data out of the given sets
-Trial by error with websockets and graphics
-Data handling and tuned algorithms
