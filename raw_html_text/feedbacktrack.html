                    Inspiration
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the problem of last leg of the UPM that they totally do not know what is happening with the product during the transportation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does
                </p>
                <p>
                    Driver read a QR code of the product raport and push the button that driver has started to move to the destination. The application keep track for the driver who is responsible for the transportation. While he is moving an application can ask driver why he is moving slow (e.g. if there is a traffic jam on the road) or even the phone does not show the movement progress during some period of time (e.g. 15 minutes). So the employer can know about the live information about the movement of the driver and therefor the movement of the product. At the final stage when driver confirm an arrival of the product to the destination point an application provide driver with inner system reward for his cooperation with the company. A final delivery is a website and android application.
