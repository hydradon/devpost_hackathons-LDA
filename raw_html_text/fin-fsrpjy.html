                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're students. We've got a lot of things on our plate and it gets really difficult to manage everything from our health to studies to work. So, we decided that we would make an app that would not only help us manage our time but would also give us data visualization stats so that we would not only be able to allocate time but also see our allocations and get recommendations on how to better manage time and be more productive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fin is a time-management platform that allows users to track their daily activities through the use of pebble, android and web interfaces. Users can simply hit the 'start' button on their pebble, phone or in the web app when they begin the activity, and when they finish, they hit the 'stop' button. Information about when and how long the user did each activity is stored on an online database, and this information is used to create beautiful visualizations on the online platform. These data visualizations provide users with valuable insight about how they are spending their time; allowing the user to learn from their behaviors and to ensure that they are managing their time most effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fin uses three separate platforms, Pebble, web and Android. We used an array of IDEs and software to build it. For the web, we used AngularJS, jQuery, HTML/CSS and D3Js. For the Pebble watchapp, we used the CloudPebble IDE and wrote it in Pebble.js. For the Android app, we wrote it in Java on Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team struggled with the implementation of three different platforms. We built on Pebble, Web as well as Android so being able to port everything and have it consistent was a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was able get everything from different points to a common endgoal. Everything was able to come together from the three different platforms into a unified system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to be able to connect Firebase onto web app, Android app and Pebble app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps include working with the data provided by the users through fin to create more in-depth visualizations. We would like to analyze correlations between activities in order to provide the user with suggestions to best manage their time. For example, if the data suggested that users spent less time doing homework after spending time on social media, Fin could suggest that the user should make an effort to check social media
                    <em>
                        after
                    </em>
                    they spend time on their homework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After spending some time fine-tuning Fin's code and improving the UX/UI, we would like to expand fin to other wearable devices, including the apple watch and android wear. This also means potentially developing an ios app for Fin.
