                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We collaboratively used glitch to build our project using java script, html, and css.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems with the google script since it was a new concept to me. Overuse of div tags can be difficult for someone new reading our code to understand.
                </p>

                    I learned how to utliize new javascript functions.

                    In the future, we would change the functionality of the site based on the topic.
