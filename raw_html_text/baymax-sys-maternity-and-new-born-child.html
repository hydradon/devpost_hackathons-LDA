                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since pregnant women do not go through proper vaccination, screening and treatment for infections, and identification of warning signs during pregnancy ,we are going to make a website(mobile friendly) which will keep the track of all the health details of the pregnant women from the day she gets pregnant till her child grows up to 6 months(as it is the crucial time for both the woman and her child).
The women can join the site anytime between this time period. Users(basically pregnant women) can get information about proper medication, health and nutritional diet for them as well as their child. 
She will also be tested for various diseases, if positive; they will receive help and guidance to avoid transmission to their babies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all the pregnant women will register themselves to the web site with the required information(email activation of account) then she may proceed to her account  and the following facilities will be given to them- 
 They can appoint their doctor from dozens of doctors through the site on the basis of reviews given to the doctor by other patients by requesting a date from the doctor(all the appointments will be on the screen in form of calendar).
 Once the doctor takes the patient he will set a reminder in the patient&rsquo;s calendar and the patient will get a text alert message as well as an email regarding the same. The women can chat with the doctor through the chat option that will be provided ,incase if they need they can also chat with the other patients.
 Women are made aware about the new government policies schemes and campaigns related to pregnancy and diseases.(when the camp is organized  providing free vaccinations)
