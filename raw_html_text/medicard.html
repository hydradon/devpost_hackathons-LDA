                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Usually, when a patient visits the hospital, they are required to complete a large amount of paperwork and explain to multiple staff members the reason for their visit. We designed a proof of concept for a system that would streamline the entry and triage process for medical visits by allowing the patient to automatically load their medical data and specify the reason for their visit before even walking into the building.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are 2 main components of the Medicard project:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        An interface for a parking gate touch screen designed to be installed outside a hospital. The display allows an incoming patient to input the reason for their visit and notifies staff in the appropriate department. The display could also be adapted to grant the patient access to park in the corresponding area, and it is built with internationalization capabilities for patients who speak languages other than English.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An electronic form to replace the paperwork that is often completed before every visit. The form allows the patient to load their data by swiping a personal ID card, then modify the existing data as necessary before submitting.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used React.js as the primary framework for both components. We used several popular plugins for React, including react-bootstrap, react-i18next, and node-sass. We also used Amazon Web Services (AWS DynamoDB and API Gateway) to provide the database and API backend for the medical data, and we used AWS SNS for sending notifications from the parking display.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the React components and frameworks we used were new to us, so a large amount of research was required to implement them into the project. Some parts of the code went through several heavy revisions before they functioned correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a frontend, backend, and API stack using React and Amazon Web Services, and each part of the stack was able to successfully interact with the other parts. In addition, we were able to successfully use frameworks with which we had no prior experience, such as the i18next plugin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about the various technologies we used in the project and how they interact. We also learned about medical data security laws that might cause difficulties if this project were to be implemented in a real medical setting, but the discussion caused us to consider alternatives for our existing features and theorize about the possibility of implementing the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Medicard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are considering updating the parking display to include a method of reserving parking spaces for patients, as well as a way to track how many spaces in each section are occupied.
