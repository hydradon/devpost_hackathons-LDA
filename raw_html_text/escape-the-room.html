                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love video games and we thought of making a problem-solving virtual environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a "escape the room" simulator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of challenges including hardware compatibility since it only runs on windows and we both had macs, finding the right plugins to use, and learning a brand new programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a virtual environment for the first time ever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of C# and the Unity software in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Escape the Room
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better puzzles, more fluid mechanics, and smoother animations.
                </p>
