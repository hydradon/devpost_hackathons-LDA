                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    San Diego being a coastal town, we have our fair share of issues with litter. We thought we could help alleviate the issue using drones and machine learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trash Hero is a proposal for a drone system that uses computer vision and neural networks to recognize litter, and then collect and dispose of it, with no need for human intervention.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The computer vision component uses Google Cloud Vision, however if we had more time we'd have wanted to use OpenCV/TensorFlow/Keras. If we had access to the appropriate hardware and necessary time, we would have used a microcomputer such as an Arduino with a camera shield for the drone itself,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to teach ourselves about neural networks and how to work with APIs. Also, we had limited computing resources which necessitated us using a prebuilt neural network model - Google Cloud Vision. We had trouble initially integrating Google Cloud Vision into Python, and the hardware was not available on-site to make a drone, only the software. We also had issues getting camera input working.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Google Cloud Vision working was a really cool experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about neural networks and AI, and about API programming.

                    What's next for Trash Hero aerial drone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Switch to OpenCV/Keras, get camera input working, get the software working on a drone platform instead of a computer.
