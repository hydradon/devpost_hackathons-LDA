                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find ways in conserving water. Through quick searches, we found most water consumption in the US comes from the agriculture industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To get some guidance, we roamed through the EarthX conference. We spoke with non-profit organizations, private companies, farmers, and municipal organizations. After meeting and getting informed perspective, we shifted from industrial to consumer residential as our target market. The average Texas resident uses a little above 200 gallons of water per day. Water irrigation systems and sprinkler systems can use up to 1,860 gallons a day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our user, essentially a homeowner, can view their water usage in gallons over the course of week, months, year, and even live data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To install, user needs a smart hub and sensors for water exit points. The Smart Hub relays data between server and sensor. Sensors are placed in areas like kitchen sink, sprinkler system, bathroom sinks, laundry washer, and toilets, for example.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While industrial water consumption is the highest percentage in the US, the primary challenge faced in the industry is financial funding - the industry users are well aware of their consumption and do not cause as drastic of water waste as consumers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consumers, however, are at higher levels of risk in water waste. There is a lot of room to improve the way water is consumed by non-industry users and raise awareness in the critical areas where wasted water can be significantly reduced.
