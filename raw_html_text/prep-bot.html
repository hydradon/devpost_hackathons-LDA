                    Hello. My name is Henry. This is Veera and Aswin. And we are working on PrepBot. PrepBot is a chat bot that allows job hunters to prepare for interviews or exams. PrepBot asks users questions to test their skills. The quizzes become progressively harder levels for more advanced skill sets. PrepBot is designed to give the user a quick and challenging 5 minute quiz to test their mettle and pick up new knowledge for interviews, projects, and academics. The quiz format is designed for quick and concentrated consumption. Users can work at their own pace, whether it is on the train or during a short break at work. Users can also set their options to get a quiz a few times a day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, we offer only developer quizzes, but we can add more content to broaden the audience. We all understand the time constraints of a modern life and it is difficult to learn new things. We all need our Netflix and Chill Time. The new Silicon Valley episode airs tonight. Right after Game of Thrones! Who has time to study Angular2? Now, we all can learn a little bit on the commute home.

                    If you are just 1% better in life, every single day, for a year,

                <p>
                    1.01 ^ 365 = 37.7X better than you were last year. Think about it.
