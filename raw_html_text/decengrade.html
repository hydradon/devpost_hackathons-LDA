                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At UofT, grades are uploaded to centralized systems (ROSI, ACORN), which are often unstable and may be subjected to security risks. This project is built using blockchain so that grades are uploaded to a decentralized system. Students may have to option to convert their marks to ethereum :)

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solidity + Javascript
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Would be better if Javascript API Documentation is more elaborated.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Planning requires more thought.
