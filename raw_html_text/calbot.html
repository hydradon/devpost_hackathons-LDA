                    Inspiration: Salvage Cal students from the burden of managing their heavy load of course works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What Calbot Does: Calbot is an artificial-intelligent chatting bot on Facebook messenger that assists UC Berkeley students to plan their college lives. Main functions and features include enrolling and dropping classes, adding class assignments, querying a list of user&rsquo;s classes info and due dates, natural language processing, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it: The main framework was written in JavaScript, and our backend server was built on Amazon Web Service. We&rsquo;ve also used IBM Watson cognitive system for training the bot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into: Reconciling Watson with the bot framework; training Watson to make the bot intelligence and reply relevance ideal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of: Training our bot to an ideal level of intelligence; building a stable framework for accessing and modifying the database.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned: Using the Facebook messenger API, training a bot with IBM Watson&rsquo;s machine learning algorithm, using database appropriately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What&rsquo;s next for Calbot: In-picture object recognition feature; comprehensively and maturely trained AI.
