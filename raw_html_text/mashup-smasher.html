                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was thinking about the problem of source separation and was wondering if audio fingerprinting could solve it.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes in a mashup song and attempts to identify each song being used
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots and lots of Python audio input/output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was originally going to use HPE on demand, but their Speech to Text kept giving me bad music. So I had to figure an alternative method.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to do FIR/IIR and effects in SciPy, also somehow doing the separation
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably going to try and attach more ML techniques to it.
