                <p>
                    Our solution is platform agnostic, not specific, it would be available through Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri. Time to market would be longer

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Using the Dialogflow API, we built solutions for several situations and then connected it to our google home.

                <p>
                    Finding a prototype solution that can be implemented within one day. We then came across Dialogflow and had to learn how it works and how it can be implemented for our case using a google home.
