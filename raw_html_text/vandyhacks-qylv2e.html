                    The Mission
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every year patients suffer from hospital related infections that directly put their health at risk and unfortunately result in death. This is largely due to low hand sanitation compliance, an issue we felt was easily solved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Object
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create a system that would encourage and track hand washing compliance related to patient interactions. This can be boiled down to whether or not a health care employee is sanitizing their hands before and after interacting with a patient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Method
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a proof of concept tracking system that would track to a database user input around a hand sanitizing center. This would entail a button (replaced by more advanced tracking later) that would trigger a system to add to a web hosted database. This could then be accessed publicly through our [link] [digitalclean.org] domain.
