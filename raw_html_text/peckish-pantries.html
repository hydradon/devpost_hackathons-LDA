                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we are no strangers to being hungry, but with a limited number of supplies in pantry.  Because of this, we thought it would be a nice idea to make a site that could take in what we have and get us a large repository of recipes that we can choose from, all in one place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Peckish Pantries takes an input of ingredients from the user and, using the Recipe Puppy API, searches the internet for recipes that use the given ingredients.  We created a "tolerance" option for the search function that allows the user to determine how strict they want the ingredient list of the results to be: 0% for all recipes that use at least some of the ingredients ranging to 100% for recipes that use only the ingredients given, nothing more.  The results are displayed in a card-style format with links to the recipe source for fast navigation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Peckish Pantries was built using a base of python in the back-end with Jinja and Flask as the HTML5 support.  We linked together some of the elements on the webpage with HTML and did formatting with CSS, Bootstrap, and a small bit of Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had experience with multi-threading in Python before, and we had issues getting the threading to work in such a way that it didn't eat up all of the CPU usage. Finding a usable (free) API that we could base the search function off of took a very, very long time to find, and then required us to learn how to parse out the JSON results into something python could utilize.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to solve all of the challenges that we ran into (see above), and did so in a fairly time-efficient manner.  Getting the search queries to complete in reasonable amounts of time was a big relief, especially given the amount of pages the queries had to sift through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that finding good ingredient/recipe APIs is extremely difficult, and we now have a grasp on how to utilize multi-threading for future projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Peckish Pantries
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to fine-tune how accurate the tolerance limit is, provide nutritional information for the dishes/ingredients, and create a means to sort the results by some other kind of criteria, such as cost or food group.
