                <p>
                    There are many people who have successfully taught themselves University level material independently, but lack the degree to show for it, and thus they are unable to get into jobs they are otherwise well suited for. What we need is a way for such people to prove to employers that they have the abilities they need for the job, even though they could not complete a degree.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our service provides testing on various subjects, the results of which can be shown to employers to compensate fr a lack of official credentials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our tests are held to the same standards as accredited universities, and user data is protected by custom encryption algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, our site provides practice tests, useful feedback, and links to sources that will help users to brush up on the material. Furthermore, should a user perform badly on an exam, our service will not hold it against them on their record.
