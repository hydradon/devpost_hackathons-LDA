                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Argument between significant other and I about whose the better driver. Now we'll know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Phone is planed in a secure location in the car. User activates the app and begins driving. The accelerometer sends data to our algorithm, which is converted to a value that is visualized on a graph in real time. At the end, the vales are averaged to give the user a final "driving/smoothness" score.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also have an auto-track mode that can run in the background. The app tracks the users drivers, and stores the data locally. The app uses POI and User Activity function to track when the car is driving.

                <p>
                    The whole damn thing. We learned an entirely new language just to visualize it, stayed up till 7am, and it worked in testing flawlessly.
