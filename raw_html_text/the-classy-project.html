                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working as a teacher at a private institution, I started to notice that many of the students that were behind were not responding to my teaching as well as expected. When I suggested group work where the more advanced students would help the students that were struggling to catch up. This method proved to be very effective, and so we decided to implement this concept through a web application that encourages peer to peer classroom collaboration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students make an account with the name of their high school and a list of classes. They are then added to an online community categorized by the school and classes that they are enrolled in. There is a forum featured for each class on the student's account, where tags such as homework, projects, test, etc. are used to organize posts uploaded by students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems when trying to incorporate the Google API as well as create a database for our users.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We ended up with a visually appealing final product with most of the features that we were planning on having.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To always use Google, and to really take advantage of online tools and tutorials on how to use them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will continue to work on the back-end of the project, so that we can make this dream a reality!
