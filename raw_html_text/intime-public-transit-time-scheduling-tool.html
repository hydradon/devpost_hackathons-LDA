                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can be very annoying when you got the bus station only to find out you missed the previous bus for only a few second, this project is designed to solve the problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provide the user with real time information regarding public transportation systems, when a user is near a transit station in a certain range, the app would notify the user with the time table, so that it can save the users a lot of time. It can also be used as a recurring scheduling tool, input a desired destination, desired time to reach the destination, then the application can notify the user at a certain time in a day for the users to get on the transportation tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using Google maps api and ios / android sdk, we'll be able to locate user's position, and the nearest transit stops with the real time information. We'll also be needing the api for public transportation systems for their time schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not enough time, and it would require a lot of knowledge regarding ios/android development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having the idea that may potentially save people a lot of time spent on waiting transportations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing an application would require a lot of knowledge about how to combine the apis with the applications.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    to actually implement it and do some marketing research regarding the needs.
