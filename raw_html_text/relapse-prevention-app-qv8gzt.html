                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a challenging app that would test our skills, but also something that could help people going through a rough time get back into their lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, our app will be set up by the user as following:
    1. Add an emergency contact number
    2. Enter their name
    3. Set up markers at places they have previously abused substances.
Now, when they around those areas (the markers) a simple text message will be sent to their contact, letting them know they are and that they should check in with them. Overall, we hope that this app will help people coming out of rehab remain drug-free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with an app that could send data to our Node.js server, hosted on by Amazon Web Services. The server is able to take in data, and send out an SMS message to the number the app gives it. It does this using Twilio. We then worked on the app to get google maps working in it. Once we were able to track the user, we implemented markers. You can add a marker and then drag it to the precise location you want. Lastly, we programmed the app to tell our server to send a SMS message whenever the user was in range (100m) of any of their markers (which mark areas the user has previously abused substances).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing google maps into an android app was a complete mess but eventually we figured it out. We also had to make some HTTP POST requests, apparently for android apps you can't do so in the main thread.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to track a users location and check their distances from certain markers they place. We also send out an SMS message to a contact. To do so, we used a server that we send the user's name to as well as their contacts phone number. We then use Twilio to send a message to the contact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton about developing apps for android, going from knowing next to nothing to being able to create an pretty awesome app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Relapse Prevention App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next steps would be to save the users markers, so they can quit the app and open it back up with all their data saved. We'd also like to optimize the tracking function of google maps to provide the most accurate information possible. We also would want to have a version for iOS, to be available to as many people as possible.
