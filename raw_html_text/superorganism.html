                    We saw that food pantries are mostly run by volunteers and so making it easier for them to optimize how they do things would help make things for efficient for them.

                    What it does is that it allow organizations to post when they have food available and then creates optimization for the food panteries by telling them when to pick up all the food and in what order, by creating an optimized path for them. This allows them to get more in less time which will allow them to provide more food to those who need it.
