                    Escape those awkward conversations
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ever been in an awkward or boring conversation with somebody, and just need an escape? Well, the great Houdini provides you with just that. An app runs on the apple watch that lets you subtly activate a "call request". This request is sent to a server, where a push notification is sent to 10 available devices with the app. The push notification lets these people know you're in trouble, and need a way out. Someone may choose to accept this call request, and you pay them a small amount (right now we're putting it at 10 cents a minute) to call you and have a short conversation with you, providing you with an escape!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anybody can activate this on their iPhone to be available to receive calls. It's a perfect solution for connecting people, in order to disconnect other people!
