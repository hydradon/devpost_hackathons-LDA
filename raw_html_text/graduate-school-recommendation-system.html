                    This is an intelligent system which basically helps a student to check his eligibility for a graduate school based on school&rsquo;s admission criteria and other conditions like weather, cost of attendance etc.
This application includes a web-based GUI which accepts an input from a user regarding his scores in GRE, TOEFL scores, work experience, a cost he can afford, semester he is applying and subjects he has taken in undergraduate studies.
Based on the input provided by the user, the system will evaluate university wise rules from backend rules and will provide a response whether the user should apply for that graduate school or not.
The system is completely configurable and can be used for multiple universities by adding rules for new universities.
