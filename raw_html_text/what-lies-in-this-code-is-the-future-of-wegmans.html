                    After going to the grocery store and spending money on groceries and coming home making one meal and wondering what was all of the rest of the money spent on, I felt like if there was a way of spending that money more effectively by having an app that had a list of meals to choose from and have part of the functionality choose the most similar meals based upon ingredients since that would be the most cost effective way of getting the most meals out the least ingredients. I would save a lot of money and eliminate food waste.
