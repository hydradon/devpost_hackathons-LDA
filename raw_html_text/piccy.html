                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not good about asking other tourists to take my photo while traveling, and there's no guarantee I'll even get a good photo. I'm picky.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Piccy offers a structured interaction to camera-sharing. It's like Tinder in that it matches you with other tourists with similar sightseeing itineraries. Since this app largely works like the gig economy, we can learn from Airbnb toward establishing trust. Being able to see what equipment other users have and rating their ability to take your photo ensure quality. And by optionally pairing users by their preferred language, Piccy presents an extra social opportunity while traveling.

                    It's my first-ever semi-functional iOS app!
