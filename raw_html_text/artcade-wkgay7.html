                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seemed like a creativity and fun idea. We are both gamers so we naturally wanted to do something with videos games. We were not sure what until the games we wanted in a website shared the common theme of cool art styles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a 10 page website that shows the creative process that went into making the games we loved. The focus was on concept art created for the video game, and the early stages the art went through
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our website on a paid for server called Cloud 9. It allowed us to work on the project at the same time. Letting us get more done sooner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had a hard time filling the page with actual content instead of all the cool artwork we found. The menu gave us a hard time for it to look the way it does now. Still could be improved but not in the allowed time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being here in the first place. That we got as much done as we did even with the late start we had. The logo was made by one of the teammates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned not to take everything so seriously, and if it isn't finish that is okay. We learned to really work as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Artcade
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a project done for the fun of it. If we continue to work on it. It would continue to be just for fun. It may become a side thing to work on. But sometimes it is okay to leave things unfinished.
