                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from our passion for non-profit. We used design thinking approach to discover the underlying need and problem that everyday Canadians ran into when making a donation. We combined ethnographic research and survey to focus on the core issue that impeded the donation process. We believe everyone has a good heart and will help others in need if the system is frictionless. With AI and distributed ledger technology, it is indeed possible.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of Everyday Philanthropist is that everyone has the goodwill and capacity to be consciously involved in the non-profit community. Our initiative uses three-steps to get individuals start, engaged, and ultimately be part of the non-profit community. 
The first step, we use AI predictive algorithm to automatically predict the organization that the individual would most likely to be passionate about. Instead overwhelming them with all the choices (over 150,000 non-profits in Canada), we use AI to automate the process. In addition, we use predictive model, based upon individuals' spending habit, to predict the donation number that he or she would be most comfortable with. Everything packaged together into a simple, one-click call-to-action to get people started. 
From there, we use transparent projects, trackable impact, and auto-donate features to keep audiences engaged. According to our research, most doners stop because of lack of communication and transparency. Therefore, we wanted to develop projects that allow you to see exactly where your money is spent, used, and ultimately benefit someone in need. We believe the amount of satisfaction and validation generated through transparent momentum will keep people motivated. 
Last but not least, we are incredibly impressed by how TD is already involved in the non-profit community with The Ready Commitment. We want to advocate TD as the catalyst of the vivid community. There are many events, initiatives, and campaigns that TD can organize that enhances the Everyday Philanthropist project.

                    Challenge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge we had is to combine all of our ideas into a concise 3-minutes pitch. We are all passionate about the cause and have came up with all kinds of ideas. At the end of the day, we had to trim down which pushes us to re-evaluate our own thinking process and decide what matters most to our project.
