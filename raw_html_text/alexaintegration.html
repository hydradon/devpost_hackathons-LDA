                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea to integrate hardware and software to work together in a way that benefits people, especially in the classroom is an idea that we all wanted to execute. Even when it seemed impossible, we kept going with this idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa Classroom Integration connects Alexa with a text file through "If This Then That". A java program works to execute any commands or programs classroom related.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used IFTT to interface the Alexa input to a text file. We then created a java program that executes the desired program or command.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa is relatively closed with outputting what the user is saying to it, so finding a reliable way to get this was the largest challenge we ran into.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a program that is able to interface with another system seamlessly was a really big achievement that we're proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of all the cloud platforms that were given to us, before determining that it would not be the best idea for this project for the time being. We also learned how to interface with Alexa and create different "Skills". Finally, we also learned how to work with built-in Windows tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa Classroom Integration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue to add more features and eventually move all the processing to the cloud rather than in a local machine.
