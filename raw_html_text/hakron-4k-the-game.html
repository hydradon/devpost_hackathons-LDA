                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to recreate a video game that emulates the style of games made in the late 70s and early 80s. The style we attempted to recreate is similar to that of the game "Rogue"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It spawns a player into a hardcoded map with enemy characters that he has to fight. The enemies move randomly about the map and they have random names. Each enemy will drop a certain random amount of gold, which the player can use to speak to the vender, who can exchange gold for different types of health potions. The current goal of the game is to defeat all the enemies on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python 3.7 and hardcoded the map with the enemies and the player location at fixed spots. The map is updated through an updater function that simply clears the screen and redraws each character. This also gives it a retro flicker effect every time the player moves across the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few challenges because some of our group members had not used Python before. For most of us, this was our first hackathon so we didn't know what to expect. But we were able to coordinate our efforts and finish the game in time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to finish the game and make it playable, given that this is our first experience working on a software project as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned teamwork skills and how to coordinate our efforts using services like GitHub and Repl.it.
                </p>

                    What's next for HAkron 4K: The Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we are looking to make our game add a fully functioning inventory, a more complex chest/currency system and perhaps dialogue and randomly generated maps.
