                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we wanted to create something that would take the confusion of recycling. Most people either don't know, or don't want to take the extra time to sort recyclables, so it all goes in the trash, or vice versa.  By reducing the confusion related to recycling, we hope to promote correct recycling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using IBM Watson's Image Recognition API, an image is analyzed, and depending on what is seen, it is categorized as recyclable or not recyclable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used IBM Watson's Image Recognition API, node.js and express for the server, as well as Bootstrap and jQuery for the web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initally, we did not know how to connect the API, or even make a request.  None of the group members had ever made an application which required a server, so it was very difficult beginning the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on visual keyword provided by IBM Watson's Image Recognition API, we were able to determine, based on an image, whether an item was recyclable or not, and it displayed on a web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the various components that a web application consists of, such as Bootstrap, jQuery, node.js,express, and external APIs.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the application to a physical hardware device (camera), and creating more accurate analysis of the images.
