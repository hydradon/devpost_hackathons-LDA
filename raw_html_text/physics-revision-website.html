                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is difficult to collate and store all of your notes, especially in a two year course like the IB. This is why there is a need for a space with all the resources you need to study effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keeps all your notes, resources such as textbook pdfs, and tools such as calculators, all in one place; enabling you to study effectively and in an organized manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML and CSS, we are new to coding so even these were a struggle for us to figure out at first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time any of us have done any coding, so the first 3 hours were spent trying to figure out how HTML and CSS works and the next 3 hours were spent slowly improving our skills collaboratively in order to make a cohesive final product. 
As well as this we realized that it is imperative to continuously save your work, as many important pieces were accidentally deleted resulting in a lot of time wasting and frustration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we were able to produce a cohesive site, and that there are several pages that link together- we were able to create a navigation panel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to actually code on a basic level using HTML and CSS, as well as collaborative skills - helping each other where we were stuck and working together to figure out how to code what we wanted to produce.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Physics Revision Website
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully continue developing and adding more pages as we continue with our physics course so that we have a full webpage with all the resources we need to succeed in our exams.
