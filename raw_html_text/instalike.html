                    is an app designed to save you the time and the effort involved in handling an instagram account.
                    <strong>

                    posts and
                    <strong>
                        Comment
                    </strong>
                    a suitable comment on them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, We established a server that runs our application using
                    <strong>
                        Python
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Flask
                    </strong>
                    (a microframework for python which helped us handling with http requests) and wrote the website's pages using
                    <strong>
                        HTML
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        CSS
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        JavaScript
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we've created a bot using
                    <strong>
                        Selenium Python API
                    </strong>
                    (an API for python Which mimics the behavior of a user in a browser). This bot has the ability to connect to instagram, like posts and comment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning we have worked with the Python API of Instagram. At 2 a.m. we discoverd that the API limits us and prevent us from post comments. we had to scrap all our work and start over this time using Selenium.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for lnstaLike
                </h2>
                <p>
                    InstaLike will know in wich gender to comment according to previous comments posted on the same picture.  For example if the previous comments are: "Beautiful girl!" "Pretty woman" "My princess" it will addres the user that posted the picture in feminine words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    InstaLike will comment based on the picture's description
                </p>
                <p>
                    InstaLike will remember his clients preferences (using a Database): won't like posts of users who the client blocked, will comment only on the posts of users which the client commented on their posts before, will like posts in a certain delay which the client will decide, etc.
                </p>
