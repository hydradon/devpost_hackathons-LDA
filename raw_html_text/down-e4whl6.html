                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the general problem we always have with letting people know what we're down to do and gathering everyone who might be interested in doing something. We always tend to skip over that one person who might be interested. This year my resolution was to include many people and hang out with those who I usually don't and meet more people. This app is going to help with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application has an easy interface that lets people know when you're down. It uniquely let's you set your status and make everyone aware.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Xamarin and AWS as a backend. I am also using phone number verification using Nexmo to verify and create a user's account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the back-end using DyanamoDB and implementing features that allow you to find and add friends was complex.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm fairly proud of the UX and the overall functionality of the app. I made it by myself, so I think I did a pretty good job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about using AWS and dyanamodb. I also learned about Nexmo verify integration with the app

                <p>
                    I need to release it on the App store.
