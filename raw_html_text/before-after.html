                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ARGH LABS is a French voice apps design studio.
We are a small team of technology enthusiasts! Of course, fond of History and US History :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Before After Skill is a multiplayer game to relive the history of the world. 
The Before After game can be played alone, with family or friends.
The Before After game is simple. Alexa asks to place two historical events between them. Each player has to answer with the words Before or After.
Before After is free. You can play Before After with 50 free events. 
Players can also buy Premium Packs to play with new events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We design it following our ARGH LABS's method. We test it a lot with players.
We develop sound design to give an immersive experience.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The production of historical contents was a challenge. Especially because History is specific to each country. The story is written differently according to the nations ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are pretty proud to have succeeded in designing In Skill Purchase experience which is for us, the first application of real Voice purchase
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have improved our knowledge on US History :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Before After
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to improve Before After and we will launch it on UK and Germany.
We will sell new Premium Events Packs such as: US History Pack, European History Pack, Asian History Pack, World War II History Pack, etc
The next "special" event packs will be for Christmas.
