                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were discussing how many games are about resource management. When we saw that one of the tracks at hackNYU was about sustainability, we made the connection to natural resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game that runs in a website. It is a classic clicker style game, but with the theme of managing the earth's resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript, html, and css to build this website game collaboratively through Github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent lots of time discussing how we could make a project that would both be fun and educational for us and the user. Even once we had our idea, it was a bit of an obstacle to figure out how we wanted to organize and display the various aspects of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to make a full game, which we, ourselves enjoyed playing, from scratch, over 36 hours. Additionally, the two of us that had slight familiarity at best with javascript were proud of our ability to pick up the language quickly and be productive members of the team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We improved our comfortability with javascript and we learned about the process for creating, designing, and continually testing a website game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Natural Balance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add more features and improvements to the game, and use the game development skills we learned to create more games.
