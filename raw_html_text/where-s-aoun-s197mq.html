                    FeedShare provides us with free food on the daily, but when we need that Joseph Aoun fix, we have nowhere to look. We saw an industry that needed radical change, and we provided that change and filled that space in the market.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to track Aoun with crowdsourced information on his current location. If you spot Aoun, you can put his location in the app. If you want to see Aoun, you can check the app to find out where he was last spotted.

                    How we built it

                    We built "Where's Aoun" with php, HTML5, and CSS3 running on a webserver hosted for free by 000webhostapp.com.
