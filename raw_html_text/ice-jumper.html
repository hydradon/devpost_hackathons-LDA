                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Ice Jumper, we wanted to challenge ourselves to make a functional, playable mobile game in 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ice Jumper is an Android side-scrolling runner game themed around the arctic. The player jumps from platform to platform, while avoiding special environmental events, including rising sea levels, ice cap erosion, inclement weather, and falling ice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Ice Jumper using the Unity engine with C#.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2 of our 3 members were unfamiliar with Unity, and had to learn as they went. We struggled to find and create art for the project, as none of us have an extensive background in art. We developed user interfaces for a game for the first time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The largest problem we encountered was figuring out how to translate a game that plays well with arrow keys into an intuitive experience on mobile. We eventually found an effective solution using the internal gyroscope for horizontal navigation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how we were able to overcome the controls challenge we faced, as well as how complete of an experience the finished game is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Unity development, and development of mobile game experiences. We also learned a lot about the deployment process to Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ice Jumper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Code cleanup, bugfixes, and finally publication the the Android App Store.
