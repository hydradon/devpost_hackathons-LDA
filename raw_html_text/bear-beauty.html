                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were amazed by the capability of the Tanvas tablet which allowed us to actually feel the textures of fabrics and many other objects. This inspired us to delve deeper into the technology in order to enhance the online shopping experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app would allow users to feel the consistency of the skincare products that they were contemplating to purchase and give them the ability to make even more informed decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used haptic technology provided by Tanvas and utilized our knowledge of Android Studio to create an app that was both user-friendly and informative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us were beginners with Android Studio so getting used to the libraries, syntax, and overall functionality was difficult to grasp. Also, the haptic technology was definitely still new to us so integrating the two was an interesting challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to full utilize haptic technology and create a user-friendly app that displayed images of skincare products, and if the user was interested, could press on that image for more information and the opportunity to feel it.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to utilize APIs and Android Studio.

                    What's next for Bear Beauty
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be able to create a full-fledged online shopping app with search capabilities, more skincare product options, better user interface, allow users to keep track of favorites, and implementing a recommendation system.
