                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I was working as a DBA the most annoying task was creating users and generating passwords and storing them securely and sending to the ones who made the request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uipath robot listens email with a png or jpg file ( a selfie photo) and a subject as create user. After getting this email it creates a user it the database and puts this image file on a blob storage in the cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Uipath , python and Azure blob and AI services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Azure AI services usage was a bit complex and it is a bit slow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to identify the person from my Macbooks self-camera and connect with its user to the database
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt how to use Azure face api with python and use Macbook Airs camera and UiPath robot all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RoboDBA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well I assume we can automate many tasks using RoboDBA we may use it to give on-demand short-term permissions. We can use it to export/import data and we may use it fır gdpr controls and more..
