                <p>
                    Shttr is a webapp that allows users to view and critique nearby restrooms. It is the Yelp equivalent for only bathrooms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Clair and I was inspired to create this application because of my personal experiences as a transwoman and the experiences of other members of the trans community. Finding the best, safest place to relieve yourself is something everyone has a right to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both Braxton and Jash contributed their own gusto to the team and were essential in providing more ideas and feedback.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Primarily, shttr acts as a basic social rating system for bathrooms, as well as recording information such as type (all gender, family, men's, women's), presence of changing rooms, and times open/closed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shttr was built by separately building a JSON-based backend and connecting it via Flask to a frontend MVC utilizing a combination of Angular and Leaflet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The three of us have very different coding backgrounds and experiences which led to a lot of learning!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had personally never used Flask or Leaflet before and integrating those into a cohesive backend/frontend relationship was quite the task! Both Braxton and Jash came into the project as first-year computer science students and learned Python, JSON parsing, database functionalities, and much, much more in an incredibly short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The aesthetic! I think the frontend looks pretty polished for such a short development time and add/modify/delete functions were completed too! We made great strides with login/logout functionality as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Learning
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, different backgrounds required different types of learning! In general, quite a bit was new for everyone involved (Braxton and Jash came in and learned everything, which was amazing to watch).
                </p>

                    Information about bathrooms can be seen when clicking on the toilet icon. Editing/deleting functions are available toward the buttom of the info drawer.
