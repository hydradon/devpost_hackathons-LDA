                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are students and we wanted an easier way to take notes.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can highlight a text and it will be copied onto our chrome extension's popup. From there you can look at the notes and click on a bullet point to go back to the site where you took the note.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the chrome extension using javascript and HTML.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges throughout the day. A major challenge we ran into was the fact there were several consoles we had to keep track of, which we didn't know about at first.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of is that we had very little experience in HTML, javascript, and chrome extensions. But we were able to create an extension that with a little more refining, we can use in our daily lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how HTML and javascript is used to create chrome extensions, and how to problem solve by ourselves when we are stuck in difficult situations.

                    What's next for Simple Notes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the next update we want to create a feature that will cite the sources that we use so it will be easier to use for the users.
