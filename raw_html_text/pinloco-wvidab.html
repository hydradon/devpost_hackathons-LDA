                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by current photo sharing apps like Instagram, but we felt like the current location tracking technology has not been used to its fullest capacity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once users have signed up and logged in, they will be able to see a map of all the photos of other users in the area around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Swift, MapKit, and Parse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to retrieve location data from previously taken images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to save to and pull from Parse to produce a map of all the locations that the user's photos have been.
                </p>
