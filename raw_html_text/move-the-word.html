                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking for the complete integration of the deaf and mute people who cannot develop their whole potential due to the limitations our society builds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MOVE THE WORD translate the ASL sign language, allowing the users to communicate and never feel displaced again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a machine learning algorithm that analyses the data coming from the accurate move sensor developed by Movesense in partnership with Suunto
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not able to make the API work completely so we had to switch between platforms before start to gathering the data. Due to the lack of time, the implementation of the algorithm with the app was not completely accomplished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even with the short time available, the raw data received is classified correctly and has a great potential. At the same time, the app is user friendly way to introduce the technology and with few changes it could become an amazing tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The complications of managing raw data, the difficulties of choosing a project to ambitious and the perks of switching between platforms without the proper knowledge. With all of this, we had fun, and we improved our skills in multiple environments.

                    What's next for MOVE THE WORD
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MOVE THE WORD has the opportunity to become a real key point in the life of many people, but for that it is needed to improve some details, and include already thought capabilities.
