                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We get this idea from when tackling a complicated question, we sometimes solve this question's solution building on prior people's work. However, only the last person who solved this question get all the money. We want a distributed system where you can easily get inpiration from other contributors and all people get a fairly amount of the prize.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a distributed system which make referencing other people's work more easily and the prize is more fairly ditributed by all the contributors with people who you collaborate and also previous work you referenced to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it based on decentralized storage solution IPFS for the backend and solidity to do the blockchain part which operate certain functions to credit all contributors work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solisity is a fairly new language which we don't have enough experience on and we need to put our mind into the smart contract and blockchain to create something inovative.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the IPFS fully functioning and most required functions working in the solidity part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how the smart contract and decentralized storage works.
                </p>

                    What's next for SD-Hacks-Blockchain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project is our first step into the world of the blockchain. This is an interesting field that we definitely want to work more on it and make it become our first side project on blockchain part.
