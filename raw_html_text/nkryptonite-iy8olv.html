                    The inspiration for nKryptonite came from the lack of a web-based PDF folder encrypting platforms. From our experience, while applying for colleges we had to submit multiple PDFs of sensitive information (i.e. our social security information, test scores, immunization records, transcripts, etc.). Due to the privacy concerns with this information, we were in need of a PDF encryption service that could encrypt everything at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the issue was that all the web-based encryptors we came across simply couldn&rsquo;t encrypt an entire folder of sensitive information at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That&rsquo;s where nKryptonite comes into play. Our service - nKryptonite - not only encrypts entire folders but also adds an extra layer of security for the more sensitive PDF folders. Using nKryptonite, we added a second layer of encryption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built the back-end of nKryptonite using the web framework, Flask, and we created the front-end completely from scratch using HTML and CSS. The main challenge we ran into was being able to successfully upload the entire PDF folder to the current directory within the computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our biggest accomplishment that we are most proud of was finally being able to implement multilayer encryption of PDF folders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with Flask, HTML, and CSS. Additionally, we learned how to work to merge the front-end and the back-end together. Our next steps are creating a domain for our service.
