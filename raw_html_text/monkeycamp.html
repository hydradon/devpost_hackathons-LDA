                <p>
                    Our friend Jonathan is a growth-marketer and struggles a lot with attribution. Measuring offline channels' performance with confidence is even harder

                    the tool lets you build different conversational popups with which you can directly communicate with your users on any conversion funnel of your website. You can ask questions like "Did you see us at Disrupt 2019?".

                    Challenges I ran into

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe we eventually found a problem that is worth solving, because marketing people are in huge need for better attribution tools that give 360 degrees-insights.
