                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by _ Keep Talking and No One Explodes _ we wanted to create a VR team game that builds trust and cooperation while remaining challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TrustStack is a two player game.
                    <strong>
                        Player 1
                    </strong>
                    wears an Oculus Rift and sees the game state: there are boxes on a table that need be stacked.
                    <strong>
                        Player 2
                    </strong>
                    must use their hands above a Leap Motion controller to grab and place boxes on top of each other. Constant communication is required between the players to successfully stack a tower of boxes. The two players work together to achieve _ greater heights _.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game using Unity 3D Engine. Using a Leap Motion Plus to track
                    <strong>
                        Player 2's
                    </strong>
                    hands required integrating the Leap Motion's Orion SDK into Unity. We instatiate
                    <strong>
                        Player 2's
                    </strong>
                    hands as physics objects in Unity's PhysX engine to interact with the boxes. We used the Oculus Rift in order to immerse
                    <strong>
                        Player 1
                    </strong>
                    and to keep
                    <strong>
                        Player 2
                    </strong>
                    blind.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making this game was a new challenge for our team. Only one of us had worked with VR before Treehacks. The biggest challenge was fine-tuning the physics of grasping and letting go of boxes. Fortunately with the help of play testers we were able to make grasping much more realistic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would like to thank BeyondOne for providing us with a VR-ready desktop and mentorship. Because of them, having enough computing power was never a worry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TrustStack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very proud of the game that we've made. It was a rewarding experience creating it, and we love playing it as well. We plan on putting TrustStack on the Steam Store for free so that everyone can play it!
