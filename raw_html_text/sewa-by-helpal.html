                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a way to link up people in need with members of the community who are willing to help, bringing the community closer, by creating a community where people help each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created a platform that connects both users (members of the community who are willing to help by either volunteering or donating), and creators (members of the community who are publishing an incident that will help some member of the community who is in need) so that users can help the people in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to build this, we first used Figma to create some prototypes of the platform. Then we used python and MongoDB for the Backend, and the frontend was written in JavaScript and React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Syncing up with the charity, running the project and deciding the scope for the project were all challenges we faced in this hackathon. We also had in mind that we were going to do many things, in a short amount of time, which meant we had to jeopardise some of the things we had planned to do. Lastly, due to our attention to detail, we took longer in some of the tasks than we should have, something which although helped us get to the final result we did, meant it took us longer than we thought it would have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are incredibly proud not only of our innovative idea, but also of our application. For the front end, we tried to make it as symplistic as possible, whilst still having everything we wanted, and be stylish, something we believe we succeeded.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This hackathon has been a very good test not only to our technical capabilities but also our mental capabilities, with the entire team pulling an all nighter in order to have the best possible webapp ready for the presentation. Additionally, some of us were working for the first time creating databases and therefore learnt a very important skill which will come in handy in the future.

                    What's next for Sewa by HelPal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sewa by HelPal is a web app with tremendous potential which we have discussed as a team. For starters, in the future we are hoping on focusing on antifraud and ways to reduce that, as well as introducing the potential of points among other things. It has been discussed as a team that this idea is an idea with tremendous potential, and which could probably go its own way.
