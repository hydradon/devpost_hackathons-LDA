                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ecommerce has become increasing important to our everyday lives and
the global economy. By allowing for items to transfer between
people all the around the world, ecommerce has allowed for people
to receive many types of goods from the other side of the globe, even
those that would have been considered rare luxuries just years ago.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even so, there continues to be an inbalance in the distribution of
items. Goods in foreign countries are still sometimes much cheaper
or more expensive than they are over here. With this project, we
hope to encourage to gain experience as a internet seller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The search tool we created highlights how different prices of
goods can be between China and the United States. In addition, we
have shown the major costs you would face as a small-time seller on
marketplaces like Amazon and Ebay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through programs like Amazon Fulfillment, selling on ecommerce
marketplaces has become as easy as simply discovering good
items to sell. We hope this project spurs you to consider
ecommerce as a source for passive income or as a means to help
the lives of others.

                    We are looking to offer users competitive prices for certain goods by finding alternatives in markets across the world. By buying and selling alternative goods in international and domestic markets, users can seek to earn alternative profit.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Meteor to quickly build a prototype of the web app. React was used for the front end.
