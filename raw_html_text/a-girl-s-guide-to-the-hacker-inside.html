                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by browser puzzle games that were created using basic web development methods but still was able to capture the interest of players and bring them along on a journey. We wanted to create a puzzle game where we could apply a narrative to encourage girls and women to not turn their backs on their passions no matter what difficulties they may encounter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Girl's Guide to the Hacker Inside is a simple point and click puzzle game that prompts you to explore a study room in search of assets to help you find a secret message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the browser game. Our process began with putting random ideas on a whiteboard, starting with a broad idea of what we wanted to accomplish, then gradually getting more specific so we could create a wireframe and build the site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students not majoring in a STEM field, our team had very limited knowledge of coding languages. During the hackathon we had to use many online resources to gain the required knowledge to complete what we wanted our code to accomplish. Sometimes we were not able to add features we wanted our page to have, but we troubleshooted by compromising and finding alternative methods of executing our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to participate in our first hackathon and create a project because we initially were just planning on just going to workshops and learning from observation. We did, however, decide to go for it and see where we could take an idea in the short time we had to create an interactive game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that sometimes the best way to learn is by being proactive and not being afraid to participate in something new, even if you are unsure of your abilities. When you are in a team different members often find different subjects easier to learn, so you can teach each other what comes easily and work to compliment everyone's strengths and weaknesses to collaborate on projects efficiently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A Girl's Guide to the Hacker Inside
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we now have a framework for an interactive game, we would like to expand on A Girl's Guide to the Hacker Inside by adding more interactivity and functions on the page as we learn more coding languages. We would also like to incorporate a wider variety of elements in our code to create different types of puzzles for users to solve while still following our main narrative.
