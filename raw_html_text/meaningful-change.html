                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On an average night in 2016, more than 3,600 homeless people could be found on our streets and in our shelters.  Chronic homelessness requires a strategic response and most often, the work of multiple agencies and the community to help the most vulnerable in our city reach their goals of safe shelter and a way back into society.  Mayor Sylvester Turner has invited the community to help implement an anti-panhandling awareness campaign in an effort to redirect &ldquo;street donations&rdquo; to fund more shelter beds, new public health and safety regulations and ultimately more stability in their lives.

                <p>
                    The app encourages the community to react in a meaningful way, rather than enabling those experiencing homelessness to stay on the streets.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Ionic was a new platform on which the team had limited prior experience. Setting up the project turned out to be challenging.
