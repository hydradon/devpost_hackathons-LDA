                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this app was to develop an application that can make a positive multi-generational change that spans many audiences. We all have had to do chores for people whether it be a favor for friends, family, or neighbors. Sometimes the experience can be tedious and non-collaborative. It is in this dull environment that our team sought the opportunity to make a difference by streamlining the process between community development, service, and collaboration as a means to develop financial management skills whilst increasing technical literacy and accessibility in regards to the usage of technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply put, the app links users such as campus students who would like to work, either volunteer or paid, as a means of contribution to their organizations both small and large. Tasks are generated by such campus organizations or individuals who offer points or monetary reward for tasks to be accomplished. These tasks are present in the app and keep track of a user's progress towards completion of the task from both sides. In order, a task is generated, which is then found by a user who confirms to do the task. Upon completion of the task, verification from both task do-er and giver. A reward is given to the task do-er and a leader board system keeps track of organizations that give great opportunities for work.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For most of the framework, Flutter was used in order to accomplish most of the work. Code that links the different views to the data being processed is in the uprising cross-platform language Dart. Native Android and iOS code was also utilized for the actual compilation to different devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Merge conflicts on github led to some re-coding of working solutions. Additionally, the different skill levels of team members slowed some progress down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have used a more modern framework that may not be frequently used by other developers. The ability to step into a more modern tool is multifaceted with pros and cons as it may have benefits in terms of something like performance but may lack as much maturity and documentation as a framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we should be cautious of how work is concurrently worked upon as there could have been less backtracking to redo past work. Other than that, general discoveries of features that are new in the Dart/Flutter stack were definitely worth learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for !~ TADA ~!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the continuation of TADA, more authentication measures including a full-scaled database and API utilization backing the microservices of the application would definitely be the next steps in terms of development and implementation. We also prototyped some IoT solutions using cloud services and a microcontroller as a potential device for notification without much avail due to the accessibility of resources.
