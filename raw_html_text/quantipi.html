                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew we wanted to make an Alexa skill to help people learn. Initially, we wanted to test cognitive function over time. However, verbally testing cognitive function proved much more difficult than we originally thought.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, we made an Alexa skill to make people think, help them test their memory, and of course, show off how many digits of pi they know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QuantiPi is an Amazon Alexa skill which quizzes your knowledge of the digits of Pi. For example, if you say the first seven digits of Pi, and those digits are correct, QuantiPi gives you the next three digits to memorize. Otherwise, it corrects you on your first mistake. Then you can try again!
                </p>
                <p>
                    With daily practice, you can soon be a pi wizard, otherwise known as Sir Cumference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QuantiPi utilizes the Amazon Alexa sdk, node.js and AWS lambda functions. The challenge was familiarizing ourselves with how to build an Alexa skill, debugging, and figuring out how pass a float to Alexa as input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for QuantiPi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd love to submit this skill to Amazon for publishing. Also, we can imagine either a web or companion app to display the user's progress in learning digits over time. We could probably gain some unique insights about memory from analyzing trends and aggregate . For instance, is there a number of digits that is the cut off for most users' memories? The possibilities are endless.
