                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some patience dose not have so much range of activity, as a result, it is hard for then to communicate with others or type messages via phones. We built this app to help then say what they want to say.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By doing simple selections as the watch the screen and push a single button, patience can choose the letter they want to type or say to accomplish communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using timers, loops to accomplish the task。
