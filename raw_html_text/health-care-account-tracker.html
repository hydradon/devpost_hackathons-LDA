                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It keeps track of patients and makes sure that their data is secured by implementing a hash code for each time a new analysis is created, which is based on the previous hashcode and the time of the creation

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Java and classes for creating hash codes, I was able to expand on the concepts and build classes to make it work

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One big challenge was that most of my teammates decided to quit halfway through, while still haven't built anything. So I had to figure out how to do most of the project within 12 hours

                <p>
                    I was able to finish a project on my own within such a period of time

                    What's next for Health Care Account Tracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this is the very basics of the tracker, I want to store the hash codes within the cloud and do verification for each time a new transaction has happened. I also would create an analysis tool for the data were given and increase the type of data we're interested in
