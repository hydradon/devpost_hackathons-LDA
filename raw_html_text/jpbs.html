                </h2>
                <p>
                    JBP is a smart bracelet that register electrical activity from your muscles through  sensors to detect the gestures of the sign language of the silent people and converts it to a voice that goes through  a speaker so a person who doesn`t understand sign language can, without any problem what the other person wants to say.
