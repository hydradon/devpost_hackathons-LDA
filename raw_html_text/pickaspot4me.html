                    Inspiration: We are tired of not being able to choose a place to go eat because there are so many around. A: "What do you want to eat?" B:"I don't know, what do you want?" - A:"I don't know, what do you want?" - B: "Whatever!, you choose!", and it goes on and on for at leat an hour when you both are hungry.

                <h2>
                    What it does: The apps let you choose your location, and will then pick a random a restaurant around the area for you.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used Android Studio for the apps. We also tried to implement Google API to get the current location and find the places around the area.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: None of us have ever created a game app so we each had to learn how Android Studio work by ourselves. We also had no idea how to implement Google API on Android Studio. There were many errors even though we followed the instructions step by step on Google website and others.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: made a layout for the app, and had the google location partially work.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: the basic of how to use Android Studio, implementing Google API, functioned as a team where none of us knew about the program before, and rotated everyone's work so we all can have a try on the application.

                <h2>
                    What's next for pickAspot4me: finish the mobile web: have it connect between the google api and layout.
