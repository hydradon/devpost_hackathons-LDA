                    We were impressed with the Oculus Rift and it's ability to immerse the player  in virtual environments. But we also agreed that something was missing to complete the experience. First-Person-Shooters are difficult to simulate for the Oculus Rift since the actions of the player character usually involve a lot of running, jumping and firing a hand-held weapon. All of these are challenging to simulate in the virtual environment. The Oculus Rift only simulates the motion of the head and eyesight to match in the virtual world, but the player is still sitting in a chair or standing in place. However, games that are driven from a virtual cockpit have many more possibilities for immersion.

                    We are essentially covering a third sense, adding a whole new level of immersion. Sight is taken care of very well by the technology in the Oculus Rift. Sound is already very impressive in this day and age. But a sense of feeling is what we wanted to add to the experience.

                    This is quite a game-changer. But don't just take my word for it. We will be holding demonstrations at Expo today April, 12 for anyone who wants to try out our latest build.
