                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people look at watering plants as a chore. We think gamifying the experience can make it a little more magical, and possibly help people bond with their plants more, which is definitely a good thing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you stick the soil sensor in the pot and water your plant regularly, maintaining such a constant routine streak will unlock chapters of conversation with the plant you're watering in the Android app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Android app was built in Java and it works with a Firebase database to collect data also sent by the plant sensor itself. The sensor is connected to a microcontroller with WiFi capabilities that uses Python code to forward data to the Firebase database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With our limited equipment, we tried to make this work in vain using a Raspberry Pi and then an Arduino Mega as the microcontrolling unit. More than halfway through Saturday, we literally found a microcontroller someone had thrown out that ended up doing the job.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first three chapters contain original art, a spiffy UI, and an original story arc where a plant tackles the burden that is writing a romance novel. Will they do their utmost to achieve this goal? Can they write a convincing kiss scene? And who is that ficus next door? Only one way to find out...
                </p>

                        One student's trash can be actually be a really useful sensor.

                    <li>
                        We all picked up some more Firebase skills.

                    What's next for Little Plant Thoughts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If the people want more plant content, some of us are willing to write (and draw) more of this plant's story, maybe to release this on the App Store later. What zany adventures do you want to see your little plant go on next? Leave a comment!
