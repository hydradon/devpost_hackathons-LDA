                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Outputting our analytics data from python into Java caused problems. Hence, we decided to scrap Java (for the time being as our test data set is relatively small) and convert our algorithms into python code.
