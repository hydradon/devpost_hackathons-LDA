                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have two children and they like to spend time interacting with Alexa.  When this opportunity popped up, I knew we had to create something that our children could use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user answers some questions prompted by Alexa.  Alexa then saves those responses and creates a story using their input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using Node.js and reverse engineering a few sample code bases available on the Alexa github.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with multiple intents was challenging because we couldn't really find good examples of how to do it.  We had to just try stuff and use the Alexa simulator to follow our code and find the bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out how push/save the input from the users on an array and then figured out how to call the items of that array relatively easy.  I thought this was going to be the most challenging part, but it ended up not being so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything is hard at first, but after a couple of weeks of reworking the code, it was amazing to finally figure it out and get our skill published.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Creation Station for Kids
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going to randomize the stories more and also randomize the questions that Alexa asks the users.
