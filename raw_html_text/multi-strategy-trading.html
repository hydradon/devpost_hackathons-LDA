                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realised that it was quite hard to run two strategies or more in parallel or swap between them on Quantopian, so decided to build a framework for how this would be done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project simply runs one strategy, in this case just moving average crossover strategies with different portfolios, until the strategies return drops below 2 s.ds from expected. At this point this strategy stops and the other starts running.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why it's good.
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Using multiple strategies makes your investing more robust, so if one strategy starts to fail (e.g from changing market conditions), you can quickly swap it out for another.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            This idea is very general (has a large breadth), and has obvious potential for expansion.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The idea would be useful in the real world, as it builds on top of strategies that we know already work in the real world.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We have considered the price of swapping between strategies, and so have made it so the program can only change strategies at most once a day.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Multi Strategy Trading
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project has a lot of potential. The next steps would include building it with more advanced strategies; a better way to evaluate how a strategy is performing; more strategies to swap between; and to allow for a weighting between each strategy, rather than just stopping one and starting another.
