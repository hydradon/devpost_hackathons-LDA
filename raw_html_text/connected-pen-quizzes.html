                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        It is scientifically proven that handwriting stuff increases memorization rate by 30%
                    </strong>
                    (can vary depending on person). This is why it is recommended to take handwriting notes during classes (even though slides are available) or write words in foreign language we want to learn. We want to use this fact to create more effective education tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing we want to improve is usability of education assessment apps on smartphones.
These apps typically work as selection quiz when you need to tap on the correct answer.
                    <strong>
                        Typing in the answer on the small phone keyboard  is very inconvenient for the user
                    </strong>
                    , it is damaging app user experience. That's why apps do not ask their users for this. But it's very limiting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        For instance when we are writing new language, writing the correct word on you own is totally different from selecting it from the list.
                    </strong>
                    The former increases your learning effectiveness to much higher extent. But in such cases it's convenient to write the answer in smartphone app using pen (or fingers).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our app we shown quiz example when user is supposed to write characters in Russian language. This type of exercises would not be possible with just standard phone keyboard.
In general usage of smartphone apps in education is continuously increasing. They are applied more often in the classrooms and for distant learning. That is why we think it is very important to make them useful, effective and fun tools.

                    Right now basic custom quizzes can be defined directly from within the device. 
We are also in process of integrating this app with our online web panel (Class++) to be able to more easily manage quizzes and students (statistics, quiz history etc.)
Please let us know if you want to test that and we will give you login credentials.

                    In general this is big project that we have been developing in a team over the last couple of months. Not all features are presented on the video. It also uses some other SDK to support things like
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        in-app payments for paid quizzes (for this app version all quizzes have been unlocked)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Magnet SDK to support chat and messaging.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        our proprietary module to handle map  game (user can pick countries on the map)
Handling handwriting (user may both write with his fingers or in-built pen) and integration with MyScript recognition engine is the latest addition. But we think it may give this product a truly competitive edge. 
Apps has not been published on any open app store yet but we believe that at the current stage is well tested and is market-ready.   App can also run on Android tablet devices but UI was not fully adjusted for big tablet screens . 
For the best user experience with pen-writing questions we recommend to use Android smartphone device with inbuilt pen (like Samsung Note).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Final note
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Goal of the app is not only to provide pure amusement but also to learn users new things. In the end we think that fun is the best teacher and friends competition is the best motivation !
