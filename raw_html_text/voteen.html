                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As emerging eighteen year olds who are soon eligible to vote in our first elections, we felt that it was a priority for us to be informed voters in the plethora of elections and government processes. However, after researching, we felt there was a lack of support towards younger voters due to the fact that information was either biased or strictly numerical and was not concise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                    An iPhone application that allows users to understand their political and social ideologies and interact through a discussion platform for political discourse to be prepared and informed voters.

                <p>
                    We did this through the thunkable application where we kept account of certain variables which were compared at the end to identify the user&rsquo;s political ideology.
