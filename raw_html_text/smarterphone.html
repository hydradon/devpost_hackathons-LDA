                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making my life easier is quite a thing 
I like, considering that it helps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tells you when your phone
is charging, when its is not and 
how much percent there is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Helps you do not disturb when charging.
For example, I just came home from 
school, I charged my phone and went to sleep.
Anybody who messages me will be automatically 
replied with a message, telling them that I am 
not available at the moment.
                </p>

                    Using autoapps on my phone.

                    Sometimes the "Phone disconnected" message does not work.

                    It takes alot of work to complete it
