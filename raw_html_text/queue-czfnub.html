                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attended a friend's birthday party which was originally intended to be hosted at BJ's restaurant. Because of the inefficient organization of queueing customers, we weren't able to eat. We had to change plans at the last minute.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assists with restaurant reservations by managing customer lists and allowing users to digitally reserve tables.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used UnityEngine and ported it to iOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several of our members lacked technical experience, so the majority of our time was dedicated to learning
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use implement priority queues and design basic front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Queue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make Queue scalable so that any restaurant in any location can take advantage of this service. We also want to make improvements to front end design.
