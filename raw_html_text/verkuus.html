                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend told me about the Leap Motion sensors, and I had the idea to bring]
dreams of playing air instruments alive. Now, in a short time frame the most
complicated and desirable result is quite difficult to implement: air guitar.
But so I started with a keyboard.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Detects finger motion with the Leap Motion sensor and turns that into notes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can limit virtual notes to a specific key to make it easier to sound good :D
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tune the keyboard up or down by twisting your fist.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Play chords by using multiple fingers at once.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Used the Leap Motion API to start with, understanding how it tracks parts of the hands.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Converts the X-coordinate of a finger into a note by rounding to the nearest note in a key.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Check whether any of our fingers pressed down from our hand(s). If so, get a note for its position and play that note with a certain audio synthesis function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Leap Motion API has an endpoint in Python, so I started with that and experimenting with the sensor.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Leap Motion api processes frames on multiple threads, so I had to sync up for audio synthesis since audio can only run on one thread.
