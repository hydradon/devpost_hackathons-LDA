                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an educational web application that helps teach people how stocks work by allowing them to compete against our stock prediction bot. We were inspired by the idea of using regression analysis to predict stock prices alongside exciting new learners about investment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows players to compete against each other on a weekly basis (for prizes/ monetary wagers?). Winners will be judged  by quality of investments and overall growth of investments.
                </p>
