                        Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    Augmented Reality has evolved a lot since the past few years and it provides a new approach to human-computer interaction. It has also paved the way to project an artificial world to real-world scenarios. Nowadays, augmented reality is being integrated with mobile games, however, the majority of them don't provide enough interaction with the game objects. Looking at the trend of mobile games with AR like PokemonGO, we decided to build an AR shooting game.

                    <strong>
                        Learning
                    </strong>
                    The most important factor for AR games is the UI design. With this project, we were able to come up with a visually appealing UI which further helped us improve our creativity. It was just one of our members who had experience working with the Unity framework and hence for the rest of us it was a completely new experience. Further none of us had ever tried working with AR games and this hackathon opened new doors for us in the field of AR games.

                    <strong>
                        Development
                    </strong>
                    This game was designed with a Unity3D framework controlled with C#. The development process was divided into three different phases: A 3D map design with props, scripting the game objects and finally the AR implementation.

                        Challenges
                    </strong>
                    Initially, we planned to make it a multiplayer shooting game, but due to the time constraints, we were not able to accomplish this functionality.
