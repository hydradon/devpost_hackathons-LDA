                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were really aiming to learn something new at this hackathon - something that neither of us had touched before. We decided to attempt machine learning on photos of overweight individuals to try and diagnose obesity type.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is meant to scan an image of the user and to then diagnose their obesity type. With that knowledge, the app can then make personalized exercise/diet recommendations to optimize a user's weight loss.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The source code for machine learning was provided by a mentor, and the app was built with react native framework and the expo camera view component
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The machine learning code provided to us by some mentors had many errors popping up - as well as that we experiment with a cloud-based kernel using Kaggle; something we'd never touched before. Additionally, no datasets for our problem existed, so we had to make our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get an app up and running that can take/access photos, then make recommendations based on that photo. We also made a little progress with machine learning and learned how to make datasets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We now know a lot more about machine learning. Through attending (all) the workshops, talking extensively with sponsors, and heavily consulting mentors, we have a much better understanding of how machine learning, at its core, really works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Weight-free
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest thing would be improving the machine-learning algorithm, which is still in very early stages
Other improvements could be location trackers in order to give more personalized advice, and a separate neural network that could track the specific stress levels and eating habits of each individual, making for a more personal fitness tracker.
