                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We recognized that the homeless are heavily ostracized for society and wanted to create a platform to help them connect with one another and share resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website that allows users and volunteers to sign up and view posts in a proximity/ratings based system. We support tags for the posts that will help users find social support, resources, or other things they may be looking for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it on html,css, and javascript to perform the basic functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were challenges with our own inexperience with the languages as well as not having knowledge about homeless people initially.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to make a project that has a bit of our functionality as well as keeps with the spirit of our idea
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned all the languages we used in this project and that we all have a lot of room to grow in terms of technical skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Home-In
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the project to reach a workable prototype, it needs to be run on a server or mainframe so it can collect user data and calculate proximity on posts to display a relevant feed to the users. Also using mainframe we can run analytics to locate the most affected areas and focus efforts and resources to improving conditions.
