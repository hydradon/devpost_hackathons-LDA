                <p>
                    Telehaptix uses cutting-edge haptics technology based on ultrasounds in order to make online content more accessible to people with impaired vision. This version prototype converts English(or any other Latin alphabet text) into tactile feedback, using the Morse code. We chose this code due to hardware specifications, as hand motion proprioceptors(motion receptors) in the hand are much more sensitive to dynamic motion.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Tactile feedback has a high risk of confusion, so balancing output speed and accuracy was quite provoking.
