                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accurate information about an emergency situation is very important for response teams; it could be the difference between an efficient response and the loss of life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Live feed from a drone is transmitted to the computer, which is then sent to IBM-Watson for image recognition. Watson finds people in the image and sends that information to the response teams, which provides a better picture of the emergency situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Video feed from the drone was extracted using a Go script. Python was then used to capture individual frames, which are sent to the Watson servers for image recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the live data from the drone. 
Simultaneously connect to the drone and wireless network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Watson was trained to recognized people in different situations and poses using live footage from the drone.
                </p>

                    What's next for Drone Emergency Response Team
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing recognition of hazardous situations. 
Improving the live feed implementation to reduce latency and increase reliability.
