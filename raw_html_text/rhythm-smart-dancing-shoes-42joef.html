                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;ve been dancing the last 6 years (salsa, bachata, tango). I&rsquo;m not a natural born dancer, and like everybody, it&rsquo;s difficult to memorize, follow and know where and how to step. Specially if you're a guy and you have to lead, you cannot focus on how to move your feet, body and lead your partner at the same time. The classes I have attended are usually too crowded, I have to follow a schedule and most of the cases are too expensive, about $30 per class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that I know how to dance better, I can see beginners struggling with their first steps, and they keep asking me, how did I learn to dance. I always respond it's about practice, but I wish I had a tool like these smart shoes that could help me during the path to be a dancer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The shoes has three functionalities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You follow a video to see how you should move your body and the shoes gives you vibrating clues to know where to step.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The vibrating clues help you to practice without a video.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Through the 6-axis sensor we could know how well you're performing the steps
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You just need an Arduino 101 and 5 vibrating motors like this

                        https://www.adafruit.com/product/1201
                    </a>
                    , you could also add motor drivers to make the motor vibrate in different ways to give different kind of vibrating clues.

                <p>
                    I'm proud of helping people, I want to make people feel confident, not only in dancing but in life. Music and dance can take people with low confidence away from their inner concerns and encourage them to express themselves in a physical way.
Dancing involves using use both sides of your brain: one half for technique and control and the other for creativity and artistry. Dance can therefore increase brain productivity and people can increase their attention spans.
