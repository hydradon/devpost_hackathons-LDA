                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A common skill one needs in business management is the ability to know how the customer feels and reacts to a system of services provided by the business in question. Thus, having computers in this day and age make it an essential tool for analyzing these important sources of customer feedback. Automatically making a machine gather uncoerced customer "feedback" data can easily indicate how the last few interactions were for the customer. Making this tool accessible was our inspiration behind this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web application gathers data from Twitter, Reddit, Kayak, TripAdvisor and Influenster at the moment with room to expand into many more social review websites. The data it gathers from these websites are represented as graphs, ratios and other symbolic representations that help the user easily conclude how the company is perceived by its customers and even compare it to how customers perceive other airline companies as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using languages and packages we were familiar with, along with packages we did not know existed before yHacks 2019. An extremely careful design process was laid out well before we started working on the implementation of the webApp and we believe that is the reason behind its simplicity for the user. We prioritized making the implementation as simple as possible such that any user can easily understand the observations of the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Importing and utilizing some packages did not play well with our implementation process, thus we had to make sure we covered our design checklist via working around the issues we ran into. This includes building data scrapers, data representers and other packages from scratch. This issue increasing became prominent the more we pressed on making the webApp user-friendly as more functions and code had to be shoveled in the back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data scrapers and representative models for collected data are accomplishments we're most proud of as they are simple yet extremely effective when it comes to analyzing customer feedback. In particular, getting data from giant resources of customer reactions such as TripAdvisor, Reddit and Twitter make the application highly relevant and effective. This practical idea and ease of access development we implemented for the user is what we are most proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot more about several of the infinite number of packages available online. There is so much information out on the internet that these 2 continuous days of coding and research have not even scratched the surface in terms of all the implementable ideas out there. Our implementation is just a representation of what a final sentiment analyzer could look like. Given there are many more areas to grow upon, we learned about customer feedback analysis and entrepreneur skills along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for feelBlue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding more sources of data such as FaceBook, Instagram and other large social media websites will help increase the pool of data to perform sentiment analysis. This implementation can even help high-level managers of JetBlue decide which area of service they can improve upon! Given enough traction and information, feelBlue could even be used as a universal sentiment analyzer for multiple subjects alongside JetBlue Airlines! The goals are endless!
