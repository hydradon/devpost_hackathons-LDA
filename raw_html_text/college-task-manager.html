                <p>
                    This App pulls the user's college courses and prioritizes the task by the weight of the assignment, difficultly of the assignment, and the time left to complete it.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google's Flutter app design for quick production and used Canvas's Web API to pull the users information

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was learning the new language that Flutter needs to be written in. We also had trouble initially setting up the project do to the different operating systems for each team member.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy to have the interface to work and the information of the user being displayed in prioritized order.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We now know how to develop an App quickly.

                    What's next for College Task Manager
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to improve on it for the future because we see potential for many freshman to use it.
