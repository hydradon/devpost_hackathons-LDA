                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My grandfather was a victim of identity theft, so I had seen first hand how hard it can be to prove identity theft. In the US we use SSN as a form of identity verification which is a terrible terrible authentication system. SSN was never meant to be used as identity proof, it was meant to use used by hospitals to keep hospital records. Today, it is not uncommon for websites to ask for your SSN and then store it in their databases. Recently we have seen major hacks like the Equifax hack due to which millions of people are vulnerable to identity theft.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our platform keeps this extremely sensitive data on the blockchain, which makes it immutable and unhackable. We let users have complete control over the access of their information; they can grant one time access to certain providers when necessary. The identity can be verified without any exchange of SSN or other personal information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built our platform on top of the Ethereum Blockchain, which in turn allows us to use smart contracts. To talk to the ethereum blockchain we have utilized javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the main challenges we faced was making sure that the exchange of data does not include any personal information. In order to accomplish that, we utilized 2 factor encryption allowing us to use public keys to encrypt and private keys to decrypt. We faced a significant setback while trying to install Web3, it goes to show that this field is very new and has a long way to go.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of utilizing new blockchain technologies such as solidity. We are proud that we were able to take our idea and make it a reality within such short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned ins and outs of blockchain technology and gained deep insights of ethereum networks. We feel much more in ease with the technology and are much more prepared to tackle bigger projects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CryptID
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to implement more security features and a more friendly UI for communicating with the blockchain. We will also pitch this idea at our college and try to bring the technology to mainstream adoption.
