                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind this amazing idea was that everyone wants to help individuals, such as homeless people, but find it too tedious. Therefore, we thought of an idea which takes away the tediousness from donating money to those in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probono is a revolutionary new idea to
                    <strong>
                        make donating simple
                    </strong>
                    . We combined the power of subscription based services with charities to give you the optimum experience to donate what you want, to who you want on a monthly basis!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript created on the Cloud 9 IDE for easy collaboration. In order to get our login authentication to function, we had to utilize the FireBase console along with the Google Authentication API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we were completely new to Firebase, we found it extremely difficult to get the authentication to work with our app. This took one team member several hours to figure out even with the amount of tutorials online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge was making the check-out system from grabbing the total value to integrating it with PayPal. This was not extremely hard to overcome but it took a lot of our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the best thing is how well designed our app is. It looks good along with being responsive due to Bootstraps and the CSS @media selector.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also really proud of our authentication because we got it working despite all the problems that we had to face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many new things as high schoolers who are still relatively new to the world of hacking. In school, all we have learned is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We did not learn how to use APIs or Firebase. This was all new and was a challenge we had to face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also learned how to collaborate in a group to accomplish a project like this. Normally, we would work on personal projects and collaboration was not something we did often.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Probono
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The plan for the future of Probono is to implement a better checkout system and a stronger authentication system. Probono will also require a strong database which can be made with Firebase. Beyond this, we also plan to make a mobile app for those who need it on their phone.
