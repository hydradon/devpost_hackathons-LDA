                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    We're both mole-y dudes. After becoming concerned about a potentially cancerous mole, we decided to write a neural network that can look at a mole and diagnose whether or not it's cancerous, as well as an iOS application to interface with it.

                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're early in the development phase, but the current plan is for a phone to take a picture, resize it, and send it to AWS Lambda. Then, AWS Lambda should run the picture through a neural network hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and returns the diagnosis and confidence

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Still unsure how to set upa  web server that our application can send images to. Auto-layout is also so, so frustrating
