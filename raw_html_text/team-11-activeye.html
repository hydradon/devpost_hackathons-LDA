                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were worried about the safety of pedestrians, cyclists, and other members of the community that exercise in busy areas while being distracted by music. Our team members have had personal experiences or have witnessed cases where, for instance, a cyclist would be listening to music and not be aware of a car nearby and be vulnerable to danger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our sunglasses have a built-in camera in the frame that takes pictures with the press of a button (also on the frame). They also have bone conduction technology that lets you listen to music through vibrations in your head's external bone structure, instead of blocking your eardrums and thus surrounding noise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used Solidworks to design the whole glass frame in order to integrate all the features and provide the best experience of bone conduction technology to our customers. The design files were printed by 3D printers and we assembled them together. Then, we built the amplification circuits with the bone conduction transducers, and tested the bone conduction transducers with several trials to ensure proper function. The mini-cameras were connected with to an SD card to save the images taken, bluetooth (wireless capabilities), and a button (activation).

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into complications with trying to get the bone conduction transducers to work. The noise levels were not as strong in the beginning, so we had to connect them to an amplifier to increase the volume.
We also ran into challenges with creating the whole product in general because there is not a lot of information online that we can learn from, so we had to talk to people in person and gather information ourselves from trial and error and other's experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of all the work that all the team members have put it and all the sleep that was sacrificed in our ventures, due to our outright dedication to do the best we can. We learned a lot from creating our own prototype and multimedia, and we are proud that we managed to accomplish all of it in such a strict time constraint and limited resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the best teams manage their time and communicate between each other to strive towards one goal. Staying focused and aligned is really important in making a project work, and we realized that it requires a lot to work to sustain a healthy team dynamic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will go onward with mistakes that we have learned from and experience that we have gained. In the future, we will go our separate ways, but keep this product in our hearts.
