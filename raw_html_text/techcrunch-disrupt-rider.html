                    Mark Andreesen says sw is eating the world. we call bs on this. data enabled by great hw/sw= compelling product experiences! thats why a consumer electronics hit is 50 million units, not 5000 on indiegogo!
                </p>

                    We decided to HW Hackup something that 50 million users could use without having to write a line of code. That constraint led us to torture test the hardware made available to us by the great technologists here -- Ford, Qualcomm, Intuit (Trash Amps) -- and saw what we could hack up that actually Solves a problem our user base would care about!
