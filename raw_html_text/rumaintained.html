                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a property owner, I have been thinking a lot about the inefficiencies that current property managers use to this day in their workflows. I needed a simple way that I could interact with my tenants without having to be there directly but still, enable them to send clear messages for things/services they need/want from emergency services all the way to pizza. I thought of a hub or central place they could use to accomplish all of these tasks with easily understandable features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides owners &amp; renters with the potentially life-saving tools they need to maintain their space(s) with a simple inexpensive tablet that they can place/access in each unit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built in angular/node for the business logic which is hosted SAP web server and interacts with SafeTrek API hosted on heroku
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the chat functionality into the application was very challenging because I tried multiple frameworks and complex tutorials before discovering socket.io which runs on a simple node.js based server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hooking up the HTTP post requests to an external API through angular which, I've never used before. Also building the chat functionality into the angular app was quite fulfilling.
                </p>
