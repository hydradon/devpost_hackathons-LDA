                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make hardware technology that allows people with visual disabilities to be able to feel as independent as anyone else.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can direct people with visual disabilities to their desired destination and allow them to know when to take a turn and if there is a person or object in front of them to avoid it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Swift on the application side using the MapKit and Bluetooth framework. We build the hardware side with Arduino, C code, and Bluetooth Module to communicate with mobile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not pair our Bluetooth module initially and we also could not add sound commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a portable prototype, which we can start using to test whether it can help people with visual disabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of hardware components and how to configure it properly with different parts such as Ultrasonic Sensors and Servo Motors.
