                    We wanted to create an app that would help people better understand the sport they're watching. Maybe you don't understand soccer, but you want to be included with your friends and watch the game. With Sports Pal, you can select whatever game you're watching in baseball, soccer, basketball, or hockey, receive live play-by-play updates from ESPN, and be able to tap on keywords to see the definition. Sports Pal is intended to be a supplementary quick reference to the action you see on your TV.
