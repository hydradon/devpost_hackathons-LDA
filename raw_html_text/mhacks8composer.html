                    As a person who is fascinated with both computer science and music, the idea of a composition algorithm came first to mind. Intrigued by the idea of algorithmic composition altogether, this became the inspiration for this hack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program is designed to compose a short variation on the theme "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star", by shifting the key, tempo, rhythms, and/or harmonic progression. The result can sound either quite similar or completely different, based on the decisions of the algorithm. Within the algorithm, randomization lies as the main driving force to make decisions about how the variation will sound like. After the music is composed, it is played out through a SoundPlayer class.

                    This program utilizes the project jMusic, which contains essential scoring tools to assist with the process.
