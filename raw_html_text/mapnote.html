                    The app allows people to contribute to the prosperity of the city by informing the government about damages and hazards caused by different reasons and as an entertainment. So, there are two ways of using the app. The first one is that any person can leave a report on the map, which contains a photo of the damaged object and description. The 
 second one is leaving a note, it can contain a funny message or even be a love letter. The idea is that any person who passes the location will be able to read the note and rate it. It is pretty simple. a person will not be able to see someone's note until he/she goes through the sender's location values. Likewise, all random notes will remain for the next 24 hours from the moment of their creation, however, the ones related to the city issues will remain on the map until the problem is ressolved. In fact, this gives government authorities more motivation to fix a certain problem and at the same time keeps citizens involved in the city life. The app allows not only state the problem at the certain location, but also illustrate it, by giving people a possibility to upload photos related to the case.

                    On the other hand, government authorities have their own web version of the app, which allows them to see all tickets, reply and close them. In the same way, huge volume of migration data combined with peoples' background information allows us to perform data aggregation algorithms and determine factors like the most problematic kind of people, the frequency of issues and forecast of their future occurence.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project includes three different parts: backend, frontend (web app) and mobile application. Backend part was developed using Spring Boot, MySql and MongoDb. For the frontend we used HTML/CSS, JavaScript and ASP.NET and for the mobile app we used Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project was mainly focused on Mobile development and proper front-end representation of the work. However, one of our team members left us during the night without notifying anybody. Therefore, tasks had to be split among those who never dealed with certain technologies and made them to catch-up real fast. As a result, the team has learned Mobile development, Angular JS and JavaScript during the night.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our idea that could become a real project. The hackathon gave us an inspiration to work on this seriously by putting all the effort. The team is currently looking forward to organize things and implement the idea in real life by making it accessible for everybody.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technically? We have learned technologies we have never used before. Practically? We made sure again that the most important part is productive collaboration. Being an effective part of a team is always important for everybody and keeps the project alive.

                    Next in the list is to apply Machine Learning techniques that allow government to spent their budged rationally and solve problems effectively.
