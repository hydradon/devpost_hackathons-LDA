                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a sweet Arcade Brawler/Beat 'em up game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Java, Jinput, and our game engine "Adventure Engine" we created a Brawler/Beat 'em up game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding how to use the ideas from a 2d game programming with Java book, figuring out how to use controllers, figuring out how to make an algorithm for enemies to find the player at an angle, Having enough time to create many sprites, making it so the game will trigger events, making player mechanics work consistently and fluidly for all ingame events, 3d hit detection for a 2d game, Creating an algorithm to parse sprites and find the center of them in order to make animation look more natural, and make the game accept a modular number of players based on the amount of controllers connected.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new means of effectively implementing animations and sounds, enemy ai, pathing and combat.

                    What's next for Chord(s)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    if we were to continue the game we would add more levels, enemies, combat mechanics, characters, and a semi-tree based level system sith a story behind it.
