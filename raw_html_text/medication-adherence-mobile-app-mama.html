                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many patients forget to take their medicine due to dementia, or feel like they are all better and do not need to continue taking their prescription. We want to inform doctors if the patient is following his/her dose regimen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Video counseling with the pharmacist when the patient consecutively misses their medication or does not refill the medication. The patient has to take a picture or video of them taking their medicine. Afterwards, a caregiver or close family member has to verify that they took it by confirming it on the app. The app will record the number of days the patients takes their drugs. After a certain amount of days, the patient will receive a discount on the meds or on groceries by linking it to their CVS ExtraCare rewards.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After brainstorming, we developed the Android Application together using Android Studio and GitHub. We wrote our code based on pseudocode activities that were drawn and described on whiteboards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of us do not have a proficient background with coding and making apps for phones. Finding and correcting small errors in the code. Communicating with the team what the final idea was and how we were going to execute it in the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided up the work. Even though we did not know each other, we worked as a team. Half of the team coded and other half worked on the presentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to hear everyone's ideas first and then determine which ideas are feasible. If you do not have the skills or background in a computer language, should attempt learning the skill, instead of being intimidated. Your initial ideas will not work out and it is ok to start back at the drawing board. Project development is about the progress, not the result.

                    What's next for Medication Adherence Mobile App  (MAMA)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add a feature in which you could donate to help pay for others who cannot afford their medication. Integrate it with the current CVS pharmacy app to compliment it's existing notification reminders, and misc. features.
