                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew of friends who couldn't participate in sports because their parents could not give them a consistent ride. We wished to change that.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After registering with their address and times that they need rides, the app will set up the most efficient carpool groups.
