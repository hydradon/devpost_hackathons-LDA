                    We were inspired to create an app for a non-profit called SKCharities. One of our group members founded this non-profit and we wanted to help raise awareness for this cause. We believe that every child has the right to a happy life and they should have the appropriate gear to play sports. Therefore, SKCharities works towards giving every child an equal opportunity to play by collecting used athletic gear from universities and donating it to underprivileged children.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Our app connects the donators (usually colleges) to other organizations around the world that would benefit from the athletic gear.

                    We used the MIT App Inventor to create our project.

                <h2>
                    We had to learn how to use MIT App inventor to build our app. We also had trouble creating a database that would be accessible by multiple screens.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We are proud of learning how to use MIT App Inventor and building our app. We are also excited for others to use this app and look forward to helping others around the world.

                <h2>
                    We learned that the process of coding has many challenges but with the guidance of mentors and YouTube videos, we were able to persevere through.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to improve our app by allowing colleges to view their past donations and add messaging components so colleges and the registered organizations can directly communicate.
