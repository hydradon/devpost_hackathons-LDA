                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We were inspired by the movie "Imitation Game" and therefore, we wanted to make an application that encodes and decoded messages.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This application enables the user to input a message and encode it with a password then after the user sends the message to another user the second user can decode the message with the password.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We made a class that creates the user interface, two classes with the algorithms that each encodes and decodes the message and an application class.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The largest challenge was getting the encoded message to be printed to the user interface. We were using a lot of String and char methods that we had never encountered before.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        We learned how to alternate unicodes and hexadecimals to print out different chars.
