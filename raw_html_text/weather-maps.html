                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While planning for a trip, we discovered that we had no idea what the weather was like! We used several existing solutions to check the weather, but none of them consolidated the fact that getting to my destination took time, and only gave me the current weather.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application shows weather projections for departure and destination locations; at the time of departure, and the time of arrival. The time needed to get to the destination is taken into account while giving weather projections.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is a web application running on a node.js backend, querying the Google Maps API for map data, and forecast.io for weather projections. We used GitHub to collaborate while creating the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were learning to use new APIs from documentation and code examples.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to complete the project and have a clean, finished product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of planning ahead before carrying out the actual execution of the project.

                    What's next for Weather Maps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding the ability to support flights, longer projections, more feature-rich user interface.
