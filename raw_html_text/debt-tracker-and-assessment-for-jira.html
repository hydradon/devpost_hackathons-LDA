                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The technical debt is a well-known concept that was invented by Ward Cunningham in 1992. Since then, it has been discussed and developed numerous times in blogs and articles. Here is an extract of this article that gives a synthetic view of the metaphor:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        In this metaphor, doing things the quick and dirty way sets us up with a technical debt, which is similar to a financial debt. Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs interest payments, which come in the form of the extra effort that we have to do in future development because of the quick and dirty design choice. We can choose to continue paying the interest, or we can pay down the principal by refactoring the quick and dirty design into the better design. Although it costs to pay down the principal, we gain by reduced interest payments in the future.
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This metaphor is always focused on source code... but, what about project management? what about the debt introduced in the project because of JIRA bad practices?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have built this plugin to bring the debt metaphor to JIRA project management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main goal of the plugin is to detect bad practices in JIRA usage that are introducing "debt" in your project. It provides a full dashboard to track and evaluate the debt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The plugin provides a full quality model to evaluate your project quality using the debt metaphor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Features:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Evaluate your project debt using total debt time, debt distribution, debt ratio and get your sustainability rating from A (best grade) to E (worst grade).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Track your issue debt at any time, for any issue with the issue debt panel. It will help you to know how to reduce your debt by using JIRA best practices and the debt quality model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduce your debt using recommended actions. Plugin shows the top debt issues and helps you by providing the recommended actions to reduce your debt. You just need to check these actions and fix your issues!
