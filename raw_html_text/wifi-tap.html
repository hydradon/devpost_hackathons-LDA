                    The inspiration for Laptap WiFi began when Robby found the procedure of getting into a wifi network extremely tedious and time consuming, especially when he is at a business meeting. He wanted to create an efficient solution where he would be able to connect to the WiFi seamlessly.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Laptap WiFi uses an RFID card which you tap on to the RFID reader to create a WiFi

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Laptap WiFi using a mix of Python, Bash, and C.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the more difficult challenges that we had was trying to figure out a way to compress a 70 digit number into 10 digits, because the RFID can only hold up to 10 digits.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we figured out a way to work around the main challenge of compress a 70 digit number into 10 digits.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this hackathon some of us learned bash and how to push and pull things from GitHub
