                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were interested in making diagnosing and buying affordable medication easy with the use of machine learning. We want it to be used by all demographics, so we planned on integrating with social media and mobile devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a chat bot that talks to the patient and asks deeper questions to make a diagnosis. Once the machine learning model takes the input from the user, it will search the internet for the cheapest and most suitable medication for you condition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started with getting a simple message to our phones. Starting from there, we had to organize how the questions will be asked and how the user can be prompted for their diagnosis. Then we had to build a data set from scratch to account for every possibility that could occur through our machine learning model. Then we would integrate with other APIs (for medication, social media, etc)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really had to condense the scope. It was a bit more ambitious in the beginning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a bot that is capable of diagnosing.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New machine learning methods, twilio integration.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Virtual Doc
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Either horizontal expansion in other sectors or talking with other doctors to make the diagnoses more accurate.This technology can be applied to almost anything, including a Virtual Banker, a Virtual Social Media Marketer. We are really excited to see where it goes.
