                <h2>
                    What was your inspiration?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millions of college students. Millions of notebooks. No convenient way to review it all at once. We saw an opportunity and created a much needed product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it it's purpose?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Espeon converts a student's notes and produces a short fill-in the blank quiz based on the information contained.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How was it made?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked to integrate multiple APIs and languages - including the native API for Indico - to create a platform on which a user may easily input data and be quizzed on their notes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What challenges did we encounter?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a variety of problems - working with new languages we didn't understand, fixing dependencies and understanding how to integrate different APIs when using different languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What are we proud of?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even after all the roadblocks we ran into, we were still able to successfully implement our Algorithm using the indico API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What did we learn?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Dartmouth is a very cold place in the morning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Espeon?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue working with Espeon and fully integrate it all mainstream note-taking apps - OneNote, EverNote, GoogleDocs, etc.
