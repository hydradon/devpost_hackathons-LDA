                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this app based off a Facebook group that connected UCI students to meet each other and offer rides either for free or in consensual payment depending on the designated driver.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows users to request or offer rides to other users depending on current location, destination preferences, and personal scheduling.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this mobile app using Flutter, which is a open-source user interface software development kit, programming in dart while utilizing numerous libraries within Flutter to achieve the goals of our project idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a variety of challenges and had difficulties installing the software, having limited help from mentors due to lack of experience with Flutter, the syntax of Dart, and understanding the concepts of Flutter during crunch time. We also had trouble using git in terms of version control among multiple files required for our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of getting our app to run and were especially excited to see that we are able integrate the map feature of our project as well as our interactive sidebars within the app's user interface. This Hack had challenging tasks and implementations, but through teamwork, dedication, commitment, patience and food, we were able to visually manifest our ideas smoothly and efficiently.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that developing a software project with a creative idea takes overwhelming research, thorough documentations, helpful APIs, cautious debugging, and a bond between all members involved are integral and essential for the life cycle of any project.
