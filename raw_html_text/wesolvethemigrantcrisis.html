                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The immigrant crisis is a major issue in the world today, but at the same time it is hard to understand what is going on in the countries affected by it. We hope a game, even a simple one like this, can show part of the complex issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You manage incoming migrants, placing them in housing and managing their work schedule as they become part of your labor force. Balance income levels and try to keep your citizens happy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the game in Javascript using Gulp.js to compile and browserify.js to inject the javascript. To write the code we each used plain text editors and ran the game in a browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gulp.js is unstable, especially when combined with git for source control. We spent hours doing setup we have had experience with before and spent hours more manually weeding out bugs that our compiler would not flag.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is fairly cohesive and engaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript is a poor choice for a hackathon since it is so unstable. Having a simple idea and a clear goal pay of though and can make up for issues that come up during the build.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Integration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We may improve further on the game and host it on internet game sites or even mobile if we have time for it.
