Accessibility for ALL: To increase knowledge and inclusiveness on FINANCIAL LITERACY, EDUCATION &amp; ENTERTAINMENT.
.
Nearly Two-Thirds of Americans Can't Pass a Basic Test of Financial Literacy
These findings come from the National Capability Study by the FINRA Foundation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;This research underscores the critical need for innovative strategies to equip consumers with the tools and education required to effectively manage their financial lives,&rdquo; said FINRA Foundation Chairman Richard Ketchum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Accessibility Community unemployment rate, joblessness overall is higher than any other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We live in a visual world; a world, where information dissemination by financial institutions are more in pictures than in words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This situation leaves very little opportunity for the visually impaired/blind people who are also need to know financial products, services and banking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply put, individuals with disabilities are twice as much to live in below poverty level than their non disabled colleagues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well informed and educated individuals are more prone to make better decisions, manage assets and their lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Globally, it is estimated that approximately 1.3 billion people live with some form of vision impairment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TOKTOK will expand to Entertainment as well. Just imagine the Baseball Game and now eSports.

                    Learning about all the capabilities and functions of all the APIs to determine what to use in our project. Testing out each function and calls to see if it works.

                <p>
                    Learning about IBM Watson and the APIs. Researching for other APIs and services. We have explored, tired, and discovered all the sponsors' challenges APIs, tools, and services such as Magic Leap, Intel, IOT, and AR/VR. Searching for new team members to come up with a cohesive team project.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    IBM Watson, 5G, and Accessibility. We learned about the need for more accessibility services and products, which is lacking greatly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Learning more about accessibility. Learning, integrating, and expanding more features onto the product so that the accessible community can be part of the 5G network along side with everyone else.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Give Access  to the Accessibility Community.
There are more pictures/photos, graphs, emoji,etc that it is hard to have Text-To-Speech. 
TOKTOK uses the IBM APIs to analyze other than words and read out loud to the visually impaired/blind person. This gives more data and information to the individual to make better decisions.
