                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we're jamming out at the gym, studying or just trying to catch some relaxation time. It's always a good feeling when the song right as it ends. Some just like to measure their tasks by length of music and this app will work for them too!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tomato player works by selecting songs that perfectly fit your pomodoro work cycle which results in the end of the last song concludes each of your work cycles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you'll be able to focus entirely on your tasks without having a loud timer noise or having ur music cut abruptly
                </p>
