                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not want to do another android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can play chopsticks against an AI using your fingers! Physcially!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Leap Motion programmed with JavaScript hosted on a website using github pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with Python, but Leap Motion did not support newer versions of Python, and it was hard to set up and inconsistent to use. Adoption of JavaScript led to a faster, more versatile, and easier to compile workflow, since it can be run on a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we did not use any Java or Android Studio. We are also proud of our genetic machine learning algorithm, because it was the first time any of us had attempted something like that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to implement a Leap Motion, how to write and train machine learning programs, and we learned a ton of JavaScript, including a retro-style web based game interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ChopstiX.io &trade;
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to upgrade from our 2D visualizer to a 3D VR setup powered by Unity. We plan to improve our website design to make it more visually appealing. We also seek to find better ways to train our machine learning algorithm, by adjusting parameters such as the population size and mutation frequency.
