                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cipher Tech Inc, enough said.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has multi layer unconventional encryption for text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used a Java password generator we made to get the passwords for the lock file and for the Autodesk action limiter. We also used the image addition and editing tools on Autodesk to code in the locks inside the part file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the password generator actually generate passwords and then figuring out how to actually lock a folder in windows and make it unable to be detected or accessed without the proper lock file password.
                </p>
