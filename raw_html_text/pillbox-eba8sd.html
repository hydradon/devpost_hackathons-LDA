                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a rule, people do not use the advice of doctors, due to not understanding their body and "medical slang." Coming home is easier for them to use Google or the advice of friends.
We must not forget about children and pensioners who forget to take their medicines, after which they may be fatal due to simple forgetfulness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have developed a box for pills with a convenient application for Android and iOS.
With the help of the application, you can connect via bluetooth to this box, select the time of taking the medicine, as well as the container with the necessary pills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pillbox is made of improvised means: 90% garbage and 10% microcontrollers
The application is developed on the Unity engine.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It&rsquo;s hard to believe, but we have developed a system for opening a box using cigarette foils. How we did it - a secret about which you will learn from our presentation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is not to say that we have raised our programming skills to a new level. But we have improved communication skills in a team and the structuring of work has improved.
