                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two members of our team took a sociology of advertising course and were intrigued by the different ways that companies collect data. We also studied how overly saturated the advertising market is so we wanted to build something to help companies stand out with their marketing strategies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collects data from targeted demographics on their responses to advertisements shown during payment processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly mapped out our detailed project on Figma. In the future, we plan to use Microsoft Azure face detection API, Amazon AWS, and Square reader SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to learn how to use API was a big challenge. Another challenge was mapping out the flow of the product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel accomplished at what we have designed, as well as what we have mapped out logistically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                    We learned how to use Figma!

                <p>
                    The next steps are using Microsoft Azure face detection API, Amazon AWS, and Square reader SDK.
