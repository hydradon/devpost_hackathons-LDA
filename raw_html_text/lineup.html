                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a simple yet powerful app which would allow us to more efficiently navigate through our day.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A crowd sourced application which requests, from users, the queue size of the location they are in, and then aggregates the data and estimates a wait time for specific locations around UW Campus. User can also simply just check the current estimated wait time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Ruby on Rails, in conjunction with MySQL, and bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge we ran into was setting up ruby on rails on all the computers being used. We then were faced by the challenge of getting a MySQL database running. We had several problem setting up the right sockets and contacting the database in order to read from and write to it. We finally had some issues fixing the appearance due to the way the CSS was made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to produce an end product which fulfilled our initial goal to estimate a queue's waiting time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure that every team member has all the necessary files and packages installed before the hackathon since that is what we lost the most time with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LineUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue developing out web-app such that we improve the algorithms, expand locations catered for, and add features to enhance the user experience.
