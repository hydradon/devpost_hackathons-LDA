                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With dietary restrictions becoming more common nowadays, we saw the need for an app to help let people know what they can have at restaurants before they go there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an application that lets a user select a restaurant, list their dietary restrictions, then see what they can eat there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API was built with Node.js and Mongo setup behind AWS' API Gateway. We gathered restaurant information from online pdf's, then stored it in MongoDB. Our RESTful API can then process this data when it is hit and it filters out which items the user should be able to eat. The Android was the main focus of the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the Android application with the API. Due to some AWS issues, it was taking too long to figure out how to make the Android SDK work. We ended up just opening up the API without any authorization on the endpoints to make HTTP requests a possibility. So that is what the Android SDK is gathering on the back end.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to successfully return results to the user in an easy to use interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's a lot of different ways to tackle this problem; but creating an API seemed to make sense so it can also be applied to different area.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ish and I are both planning to continue working on this until the summer. Next fall, we plan on continuing development and take this to market.
