                    Tripster is a web app that uses historical data collected by automatic to evaluate your transportation impact over time.  We&rsquo;ve taken Jerry&rsquo;s 600 trips and evaluated his impact on three dimensions: 
Environmental
&bull; How smoothly are you driving? 
&bull; Could this trip be easily moved to more sustainable alternatives? Short trips could be moved to walking or biking.  Compatible trips could be moved to transit.
                    <br>
                    Safety
&bull; Are you performing emergency braking maneuvers? 
&bull; Are you speeding? 
Money
&bull; How much are these trips costing you over time? 
Our app calculates your transportation impact across these dimensions, calculates your transportation impact and assigns a score.  As a user, you want to reduce your transportation impact by reducing your scores.
                    <br>
                    Technical Background
Using R as the data analysis tool, our python program connects between the automatic api and our front end.
                    <br>
                    Automatic APIs used
Rest API: Trip: Get a Specific Trip
Authentication API
Future Vision
In the future, as richer datasets become available from Connected and Automatous vehicles, the scope can be expanded to include: 
&bull; Richer Safety data: 
o   Proximity to other vehicles 
o   ABS and stability control events
o   Accelerometer data (second by second)
&bull; Other environmental data: 
o    Weather
&bull; Money
o    Other end to end trip costs including tolling and parking
