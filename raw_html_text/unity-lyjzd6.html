                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by a heavy mixture of Pokemon Go and NCR. We wanted to create something that could utilize NCR's information in a more unique way, and we figured the best way to do that was to create a coupon/promotion-searching app. However, we wanted to give it a more fun spin (which is where Pokemon Go comes in) by involving AR/VR within the app somehow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user goes into a store and within the aisles are hidden digital coupons. Using GoShop, they are able to see the relevant digital coupons and promotions while walking through the store. They can capture these coupons and promotions so they are able to use it while they're shopping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Teleportal's API, we were able to create a virtual environment that users could walk around in. Then, we used the NCR API to generate the promotions that we can give to the user, and attempted to populate those within the virtual space itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything we implemented in this application was stuff that we learned about this weekend like the NCR API, VR, and Unity. Learning how to efficiently use all of these things was a bit difficult, especially in the limited time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Considering that none of us have any experience with creating an application that deals with AR/VR, we're very proud that we could create this application that is heavily based in AR/VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned skills in various areas such as Unity, API's, SQL, and basically everything in this application we just learned how to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GoShop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we will be able to work on it a bit more and keep learning more about ways to make it better.
