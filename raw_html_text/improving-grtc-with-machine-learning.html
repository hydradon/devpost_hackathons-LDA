                    On Broad St, a major artery of Richmond, the GRTC Pulse system is being built. "GRTC Pulse is a modern, high quality, high capacity rapid transit system that will serve a 7.6 mile route along Broad Street and Main Street, from Rocketts landing in the City of Richmond to Willow Lawn in Henrico County."

                <p>
                    While this will connect the east and west ends of Richmond to city center, does this system serve those areas that need public transport the most?  By identifying these areas, the system can fill a need of the city while also being a more attractive option for people in the city who would not have used it before, thus increasing the number of people using public transport and lowering the emissions from people driving their own car.

                    By using public data sets and open-source software, machine learning models were made to target areas of low-income housing that are more likely to use public transport. This project also made use of Flickr data in the city of Richmond to identify neighborhoods and attractions in the city of Richmond.

                    This project used the Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME). "KNIME is an free and open-source data analytics, reporting and integration platform. KNIME integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining concept." (Source:

                    ). Using this GUI, a pipeline was made to extract data from public data sets and cluster them according to different machine learning algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dataset were collected from Flickr, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, arcgis.com, census.gov, and data.gov. Datasets from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development included Public Housing Buildings, Public Housing Development, and HOME Program Activity.

                    DBSCAN is a machine learning algorithm that creates clusters from a central point _ p _. If another point _ q _ is within a reachable distance (determined by epsilon), then the points are clustered together. From point _ q _, if another point _ z _ is within reach, then that point is added to the cluster of points _ p _ and _ q _.  A cluster must have a number of minimum points else it is considered noise. This allows for clustering of amorphous, nonspherical shapes. This allows for neighborhoods to be identified that might go straight down a block or are in a culdesac.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Datasets from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development were grouped into a single dataset to draw clusters. Using the DBSCAN algorithm seeded with values for epsilon of 0.01 and minimum points per cluster of 5.
