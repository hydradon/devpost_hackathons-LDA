                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took me multiple days to go in every grocery store in Stockholm in my firt week here. I know that many people don't have that free time. So, I've decided to do something about it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project makes it easy to compare the prices of the products you're interested in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've scrapped the prices on the stores websites and saved them in a database. Then, we used shiny to display the results in an user-friendly way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scrapping the data was by fas the hardest part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building an entire applicaiton in a few hours with people we never met before.

                    What's next for stores_prices

                <p>
                    Get more data and more statistician feature to analyse the results (e.g. correlations between days of the week and sales, prices and type of food...), georeferences...
