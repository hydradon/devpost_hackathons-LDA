                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Miceless is an mobile app and a desktop application, where users can control their desktop by interacting with their phone like a joystick, by tilting, or by gesturing like a trackpad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the mobile app using Google's Flutter framework, and used Electron, NodeJS, and RobotJS for the desktop app. The input data is transferred using websockets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenges picking the right technology to send the input data to the desktop before finally settling on websockets. Also, configuring the desktop app to work on all operating systems was a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Miceless
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next up, we want to make it as easy as possible to connect a phone to the desktop app, perhaps through the use of printable barcodes or RFID tags.
