                    While trying to get my friend's attention when he was listening to music at 100% volume (in order to cancel the outside noise), we came up with a novel idea to create a device that would enable the listener to choose how much music/outside noise to hear. By doing so, we would give the user more comfort and flexibility, while also decrease hearing loss due to the damage done by high volume music from earphones.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    The device functions as a filter system that enables the user to listen to music via earphones, but filter outside noise using a program we wrote on the Raspberry Pi. With the device, the user can control the ratio of music to outside sounds, which are picked up by the microphones placed on the sides. There is also code for a secondary function that alerts the user when his/her name is called by sending a ping to the headphones when the user's name is called.

                <h2>
                    We built the base using scrap parts. The primary base is composed of wood carved and sanded straight out of a plank. The semi-flexible neck attachments are gooseneck tubes that were extracted from a computer fan. The Raspberry Pi is used to run the device. A couple headsets and microphones were used to enable the physical functionality.

                    Originally, we planned on the headset to play music from smartphones via Bluetooth, but we had a bug with connection that made it too hard to fix within the given time. Also, headphone wires are much more difficult to manipulate and solder than regular wires, so it took much more time than expected to wire the whole system.

                <h2>
                    We are very proud of creating a device from scratch using recycled and raw materials, while utilizing a system that we never used before. We very satisfied that we got to implement our idea into reality.

                    We learned how to write code on a Raspberry Pi, and hack headphones.

                    We plan on fixing the aforementioned Bluetooth issue, and making the body and case for the device more streamlined.
