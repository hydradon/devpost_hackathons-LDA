                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bottom Line was inspired by the many long, boring, and confusing terms and conditions that need to be agreed to before using any sort of online product. The goal was to create a comprehensive and organized collection of the main points in a terms and conditions agreement for the user.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This chrome extension searches through the terms and conditions for products and highlights key words and their contexts within the agreement in a comprehensive summary. It also stores a history of what you've agreed to onto a Blockstack webapp linked to your Blockstack account.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One big challenge included modifying the Blockstack webapp to function according to the needs of the program. There were specific functions and interactions that needed to occur between the program and the webapp that were difficult to set up. 
It was also challenging to configure the chrome extension to direct the user to the proper location based on the desired keyword

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud that we were able to create a functional Google Chrome extension with minimal Javascript education. An extension of our complexity needed a lot of trial and error and also research, which were worth it at the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned extensively in basic web developing to be able to create a complex Google Chrome extension and also a lot on data storage and functionality between .html, .js, and .json files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bottom Line
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next steps include creating a popup feature where the user could select a block of text to be summarized and a window would pop up containing the main points of the document. Another future improvement could be fully automating as much as possible, leaving as little manual work on the part of the user. 
Bottom Line could also be modified to function on mobile devices as many online agreements are signed on your smartphone. 
Finally, Bottom Line would like to integrate an AI system into its summarizing process to create a more accurate and comprehensive run down of the document's contents.
