                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have often found ourselves frustrated with the UCSD Free and For Sale page on Facebook, as its layout was very confusing and hard to use. We wanted to create an app that made the experience much more enjoyable for users, and also much easier to get to the students you want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, as a buyer, you would be able to swipe through the items for sale, just like Tinder. If you swiped right, or 'Liked' the item, it would be added to your cart. You'd have 10 minutes to complete the purchase for the item, and then it would be put back in the shopping center for others to look at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift and XCode to build our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never used XCode or Swift before, so it was a huge learning curve for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned an entirely new language, and that we can use, and we hope our classmates can use as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Swift, and how many components go into just one application. We also learned how to develop a working prototype in such a short amount of time, as well as how to make compromises along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ShoppingCenter-UCSD
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope in the future to implement a real data structure that can properly store all the data on an online server.
