                    Inspiration I just wanted to come to this event for the first time, see what it was all about and how I could grow as a computer scientist and person in general

                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it I simply built this project through the Unity3D editor and Visual Studio using C
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into A lot of the challenges ran into were on the back end, coding side of the came. I feel like a lot of my movement commands and controls were registering correctly, and I spent a lot of time working through and ate up a lot of my time. I feel like I could've put more into the design of the game.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of I'm definitely proud of myself for attending this event. By coming here, I came out of my comfort zone and grew as a person. I was a little scared at first because I didn't know what I was going to do or how would I compare to everyone else, but I got over that and had a great time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned That preparedness is everything. I feel I could've done a lot better and gotten a lot farther if I had came into the event knowing what I wanted to do and refreshing on those skills.
