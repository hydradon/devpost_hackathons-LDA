                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recent events and natural disasters have caused much destruction to people living on the coast. Weather forecasts are only predictive to a certain degree, and many people are not notified in time during these disasters. We hope to change this by creating a simple, complete package product, that can be deployed on any coast and can send updates in real time to a web based server. The server can also send messages straight to people's phones to alert them in emergencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This station monitors wind speed, temperature of air and water, and wave strength. It then reports via cellular network to a remote server which then creates charts and sends messages as needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Particle.io board was used to create the device, Amazon Web Services was used to host the server, and Cisco Spark will be used to create a space in which people can view the data, discuss conditions, and receive alerts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both members of this team are electrical engineering students, and did not have as much software experience to create this project as we originally wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of our implementation of the Particle.io. We believe that this full package solution does not yet exist on the commercial market.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So much learning. We played around with Cisco-Spark, and hope to have it running on time for the demonstration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Coast Guard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, a more robust implementation will be created.
