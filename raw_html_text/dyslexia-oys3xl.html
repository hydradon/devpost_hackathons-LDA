                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration -  So, when we were leaving our AirBnB in Boston to head towards Harvard we met this jolly guy name Calvin who was standing just in front of the backyard. We got to know that he was a Dyslexia patient, he was  staring at the watermelon and giving all of us beautiful smile but what made me give it a second thought was the way he was speaking which was difficult to interpret  and when we understood what he was trying to say was &rdquo;Good Luck have a great time&ldquo; I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about  it .

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Easylexia is a mobile application which makes learning easy for the children suffering from Dyslexia. What we have done is that we've included some games which will help them to learn Alphabets, Numbers and Stories. So, the children will be able to learn by playing games in our app. From this, they'll enjoy also and will be able to learn also.
We also have a website which has a similar functionality.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the coding was done in Java because we have built an Android app. Also, for the website we have used react. We have hosted our website on Heroku. Although we had been given a domain name by Domain.com but we were facing certain issues while hosting it on Domain.com, so we had to use Heroku. We have also built a User Experience design for it using Adobe XD.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges. First of all, our team lacked someone who had experience in ML/Deep Learning so we had to think of an idea which did not require these skills. Also, working on a project with new people was a bit challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gave our best and were able to complete our project. Also, we met new people during the event which was a great experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work as a team. Also, how to manage a lot of work within a limited time period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for dyslexia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have thought that we'll be adding a location based feature of interactive sessions in which the people using this app in a specific locality will gather at a place and use our app for collective learning.
