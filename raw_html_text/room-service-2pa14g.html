                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for Room Service was hearing all of the stories from Freshman at Freehold High School, who were constantly lost in the building.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows the user to construct a digital building in 3D space that represents a real building. Then, users can identify a starting location, and an end location, almost anywhere in the building, and are provided with the shortest route from start to finish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Room Service was created using Unity, and coded in C# using Visual Studio. The logo was designed using inkscape.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The User Interface came with many challenges, as we had troubles with taking data from the users, and implementing different controls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were very proud of how rapidly the algorithm found and displayed the shortest path between two locations within the building.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the hackers that created Room Service learned a lot about coding in C#, and developing GUI's in Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Room Service
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that Room Service can eventually become a mobile app, for more practical use. We would also like to add features in which a user can save and "distribute" their virtual building.
