                <p>
                    Person one get a challenge. He has to instruct person two to complete it. Like "go take a picture of a yellow flower" that is atleast 10 meters away from where he is at. This gives the team access to the yellow brick that they need to build the final challenge. After all of the brick have been unlocked the final challenge can be build a figure or solve a math problem where every color bring means some thing. Like: Person 1 get the info that the brick means this,  Blue brick = 4, Yellow brick = 2, Green brick = 6, Red brick = "+" and White = "=". Now he have to instruct the second person to solve the math problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to make an app that should use tensor flow to recognize object and that the final solution is right. And use google maps to tell where they are at, and track how far they moved.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn&acute;t have any experience with tensor flow.  Only one of us had made an android app before.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we had great teamwork. And met new people instead of just joining people we already knew.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That Tensorflow is hard. We got the basic understanding but it is still really hard.
