                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always wanted to be able to travel the world, but the lack of visible options and affordability seemed to always hold me back. With this project, traveling the world could become a more personalized ordeal with different travel packages best suited for every type of person. whether it'd be hotels, restaurants or attractions, everyone will get the travel accommodations best suited for their profiles!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gathers user data from facebook in order to determine the most convenient travel packages for each user.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this web application using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and the Facebook API using javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not being too familiar with the javascript programming language or even the Facebook API, challenges included having to learn these technologies on the go while trying to 'squeeze-out' the best functionalities possible for this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Made a responsive design using some bootstrap elements together with my own css knowledge. I was able to learn two new things which were to get more familiar with Javascript and the Facebook API to gather user data to accomplish things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eztrips
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately during this hackathon we were not able to acquire the domain necessary to include a lot of the travel agencies APIs which requires forms to be filled out in order to send request to be able to access their data. In the future, eztrips could include many more travel agencies to offer costumers more variety and options in their adventures.
