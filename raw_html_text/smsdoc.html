                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team identified two intertwined health problems in developing countries:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Lack of easy-to-obtain medical advice due to economic, social and geographic problems, and
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Difficulty of public health data collection in rural communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This weekend, we built SMS Doc, a single platform to help solve both of these problems at the same time. SMS Doc is an SMS-based healthcare information service for underserved populations around the globe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why text messages? Well, cell phones are extremely prevalent worldwide [1], but connection to the internet is not [2]. So, in many ways, SMS is the
                    <em>
                        perfect
                    </em>
                    platform for reaching our audience in the developing world: no data plan or smartphone necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1) Democratizes healthcare information for people without Internet access by providing a guided diagnosis of symptoms the user is experiencing, and
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Has a web application component for charitable NGOs and health orgs, populated with symptom data combined with time and location data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That 2nd point in particular is what takes SMS Doc's impact from personal to global: by allowing people in developing countries access to medical diagnoses, we gain self-reported information on their condition. This information is then directly accessible by national health organizations and NGOs to help distribute aid appropriately, and importantly allows for epidemiological study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        The big picture:
                    </strong>
                    we'll have the data and the foresight to stop big epidemics much earlier on, so we'll be less likely to repeat crises like 2014's Ebola outbreak.
                </p>

                            Nexmo (Vonage) API
                        </em>
                        allowed us to keep our diagnosis platform exclusively on SMS, simplifying communication with the client on the frontend so we could worry more about data processing on the backend.
