                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw a strong need to keep students on campus at our home college because increasing campus activity and involvement has been shown to increase grades and graduation rates. All of which, are very helpful at the community college level. We also saw that our friends were interested in seeing whats going on on campus but there no app contained all of the events in it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It currently holds events taken from our school's website and places them into a Google map, into a list, and profile (for more information). The app also has comments on the events so users can see comments posted on a event (and in the future users will be able to create a account and post comments, add others to overall increase involvement on campus). The app also has a profile corresponding to a user (the profile includes information such as a picture, amount of friends and events that were recently attended).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenges that were mainly technical because only one of us had experience with Android development. But along the way we learned how to learn to adapt.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the fact that our app is pretty functional and looks pleasing. Many of our components are also very scalable to so we can expand this concept to all the events on our school and potentially other schools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work very fast. Since there was only one member on our team that knew Android, we were all constantly asking him for help and thus, we all couldn't be helped. So we learned how to use our resources and constantly ask for help from mentors around us and by looking online for help. We also learned how to work very well technically and socially. We learned how to work together and solve our arguments in a good way and learned how to github to work collaboratively on code.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will definitely be continuing to work on this project for a while. Our goals currently include: adding full functionality and potentially working with the school to release this and have it available for students to download on the play store.
