                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We parents come to the hospital there are a lot of overwhelming experiences that they will face with their children.  We wanted to create a guide to ease the anxiety of a family's hospitalization.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is a digital guide for a child's caregiver(s) during her stay at New York Presbyterian Hospital.  The two features are "My Care Team" and the "My Daily Journey".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "My Care Team" feature is a highly visual interface that helps parents become familiar with the many staff members that will interact with their child.  Parents and their children can learn more about their provider's backgrounds and interests.  It is constantly refreshed so that staff members are always up to date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "My Daily Journey" feature gives the opportunity for providers to sit down with parents to build a child's journey together.  In this way, the child's family is truly a collaborator in their experiences.  Throughout the day parents can see and interact with the events planned for their children, such as giving feedback after procedures or being reminded when procedures are over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a brainstorming session with pediatric subject matter experts to learn the family's pain points during a hospital stay and to receive advice on how to improve it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used a prototyping tool called Invision to built an iPhone prototype.  We also , .  To do graphic design, we used Photoshop and Illustration.  In addition, we used QR codes to ease of installing this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our brainstorming session with the pediatric subject matter experts, we received numerous ideas and were overwhelmed by them.  We had to whittle down the number of ideas to the ones we felt are most beneficial to the family via an online poll.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of how cohesive our team came together even though we had a team member who was located geographically apart.  Our communication was very effective and everyone was on the same page and with the same goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are of course very proud of the wonderful app that we produced.  Everyone from the graphic designers to the FHIR experts came together for one common cause to produce something truly worth looking forward to!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about FHIR and what benefits it offers and we look forward to using it to build it into our app in the coming weeks.
