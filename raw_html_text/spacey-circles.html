                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For this project, we were inspired by simple and fun games. We wanted to make something that was fun, and at the same time easy to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game is called Spacey Circles, and it is a simple game with different gamemode and maps. The players/balls will bounce when collision occurs and the different surfaces adds challenges to the gameplay. There will also be different upgrades spawned randomly around the map to upgrade the speed or weight of the player.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this using Pygame and the python math library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were programing the game, we ran into many challenges. The first challenge that we faced is player collision. Since the other player need to bounce off of the player, we had to use trig functions to find the angle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to figure out how to detect collision between a circle and a rectangle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program efficient code and learned how to do almost perfect collision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Spacey Circles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to add multiplayer or server to our game.
