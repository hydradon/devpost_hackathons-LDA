                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Analyzes the tweets describing restaurant reviews based on regular expressions of adjectives. The program computes the average percentage of each individual restaurant review.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using python and Twitter API we pulled data from Twitter related to specific keywords, and exported a list of tweets to a text file. We used java to read in the text file and analyze the data for specific adjectives.

                    Incorporating the python and java code in unity.
                    <br>
                    Algorithm to compare tweets with key adjectives/words and providing an accurate rating system.
