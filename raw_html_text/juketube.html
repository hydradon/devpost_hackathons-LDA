                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Repurposing older technology for modern times: What do you think of when you hear retro?
  For us it was old-school diners and jukeboxes, which was the inspiration for this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JukeTube is a virtual jukebox, where anyone can request a song (in the form of a youtube video) to play.
  Songs are added into the queue and played when their turn is up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JukeTube runs as a web server written in python, and can be integrated with an IOS app to easily request tunes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determining how to play audio.  Should we use Spotify, Youtube, or something else?
  Determining the best way to run a web server that would control the jukebox.
  Dealing with awkward APIs and manipulating processes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a functional product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determining the best technology to accomplish a job is pretty difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JukeTube
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A fully-functional app, and more attractive front-end for requesting songs.
