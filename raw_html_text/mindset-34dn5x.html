                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the large problems caused by mental health and social media in our communities back in the United States, such as suicide, school shootings, and depression. Coming from a country facing a rise in school shootings and lack of government action, we decided to try and tackle one aspect of this issue. Social media has had a profound impact, whether good or bad, on all of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app tracks the state of a person's mental health on social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. With our app, parents are able to detect signs of distinctive emotional changes in their child as a result of social media while protecting the privacy of the child.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using the Swift programming language on Xcode. We also incorporated the use of Google's Cloud Computing Technology with machine learning and AI to perform a complete sentimental analysis of a child's online activity while maintaining and protecting the privacy of the child.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have our idea successfully manifested in the form of a working, practical application that has the opportunity to solve real world issues.
                </p>

                    What's next for MindSet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand our capabilities to as many social networking platforms as we can, and bring more functionality in order to facilitate emotional wellbeing.
