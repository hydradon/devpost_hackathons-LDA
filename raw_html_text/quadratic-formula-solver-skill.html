                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a kid, and learning math through school, I was never able to check my answers for one of the hardest things in algebra, the quadratic formula.  With this skill, kids can check their solutions to the quadratic formula after doing their homework, instead of trying to explain what the formula is to someone older.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill solves the quadratic formula using the given coefficients and returns the solution to the child to check their solutions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using javascript and the Alexa SDK, piecing together the bits I needed for the skill to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sample utterances and getting Alexa to recognize what numbers were said.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the skill certified and on the skill store, since it's my first one!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned what I need to make skills quicker, and how to make the future skills I want to create.
