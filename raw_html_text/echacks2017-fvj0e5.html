                    We are two passionate computer systems engineering students that are taking on our
                    <strong>
                        first hackathon.
                    </strong>

                    Our project, is a
                    <strong>
                        machine learning
                    </strong>
                    program that can predict the yards an NFL team gets in a game based on the skill level of the team and the defending team. We came into this hackathon with only a couple bags,  a lot of excitement, and absolutely no knowledge on machine learning. We spent the first day pouring over any information we could get on machine learning, building up our knowledge on the topic. Through some struggles, we managed to implement a program that can read NFL stats and predict the amount of yards a team can get, based on the skill level of both teams.
