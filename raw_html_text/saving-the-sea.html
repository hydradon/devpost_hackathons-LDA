                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was seeing the destruction of the Ocean during the power point, it really resonated with us and we felt powerless. This led us to research what we can do to help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It educates people on problems in the ocean with three different components; a quiz, a interactive optimal solutions page, and a problem and solutions page of common issues in the ocean.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and C# to create our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many challanges with C# as we are new to the language and had to learn on the go. Also, as it was our first Hackathon, we had difficulty with how to plan and go with our plan throughout the competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our platform with the little knowledge we had prior to the competition. We are also proud of how much all of us learned in the past two days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that you will face problems, and perseverance is key to succeeding.

                    What's next for Saving the Sea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to expand our platform to producing technology to be able to analyze water without human input in order to provide beneficial suggestion to clean the water
