                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The rubix cube from Statefarm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As time progress while you try to solve the rubix cube, the rubix cube provides commentary on your performance. The longer you take the more rude the cube becomes. It provides comments every 15 seconds, and as time progresses the more "spicy" the comments become.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using React JS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the cube to be interactive with the user was a challenge we ran into.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding the voice feature while the user solves the cube was our main goal which we were able to accomplish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We reinforced our understanding of React JS, and taught another team member about these fundamentals along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sassy Cube
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to re-shuffle itself repeatedly after a certain amount of time has passed while the user is trying to solve the cube.
