                    This problem focuses on finding possible solutions to the issue of managing workloads in a distributed environment with a micro-services based architecture, with emphasis on how these would benefit Apache Airavata. This leads to finding the best way that different micro-services (eg: Airavata micro-services) should communicate and distribute work, in such a way that:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We maintain the ability to scale these micro-services whenever needed (autoscale perhaps?).
The architecture achieves fault tolerance.
We can deploy these micro-services independently, or better in a containerized manner &ndash; keeping in mind the ability to use devops for deployment.

                    Business logic should be stateless.
Data Caching becomes important.
Contributor on-boarding is important.
Developers are &ldquo;humans&rdquo;
Make learning, development, testing IDE compatibility and deployment seamless so they can have some life.
