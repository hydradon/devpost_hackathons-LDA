                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we went in a local hackathon organised by the developer circle in
                    <strong>
                        Kigali-Rwanda
                    </strong>
                    , we realized that some people had come with no idea what they were going to work on. more to that, they had no teams or whatsoever, so the team were put together randomly. This brought me and my friends to think that,  if there was a platform where right after being added to a local developer circle, people were added to it, and be able to create a profile, it would provide a possibility to find a perfect collaborator or mentor in your area. Also being able to find tools and documentation that others have already used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What our application "Circle" does, is that it gives you an updated list of circle members and their capabilities, you can be able to post and your post will be vetted and given credibility by other users. you can create a profile and other users(members of the circle) you worked with can rate you according to projects you worked on together. You can also post documentations and links to your work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built everything in react-native with a mongodb back end, we also used Facebook  login, and Facebook-graph to retrieve information about members of developer circles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we had a problem of getting users in our app straight from already existing Facebook developer circles, we wanted to solve this by using graph api to retract information on Facebook. but Facebook deprecated user_group permission. Hence we couldn't retrieve all the information we wanted to use. We are still working on solutions to fetch these data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we are proud to have worked on this and delivered the product we have now within the time-frame that we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the concept of team work and task partition. This is actually very hard, and we managed to work together to deliver the final product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Circle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking forward to pushing further and improving the platform to build a stable release so as to serve our community better. We want to make this a repertoire of programmers country-wide and region-wide. It will be an unprecedented platform.
