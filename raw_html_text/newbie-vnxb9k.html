                    is a community where people curate the best learning resources and study them together in real-time &gt;&gt; Imagine Product Hunt for Tutorials + Twitch For Studying

                <p>
                    People will use it because: 
1) It&rsquo;s better than searching on Google for hours looking for the best tutorials - the community will do that better together and make it instantaneous for you to start learning what you want with confidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) It&rsquo;s better than studying alone. There will be other people watching the same tutorial as you, at that very same moment. You can help each other when someone gets stuck or just make fun of the teacher together.

                    We want to help people realize they can learn anything.
