                    Inspiration: Jae's girlfriend has had a problem with buying an expensive I-Clicker for attendance and pop-quiz for classes. She sometimes forgot to bring it to classes, so she had difficulty to attend the lecture.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Using an RFID sensor and Keypad embedded into a desk to get the user's information to do attendance and activities in the class.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We designed an RFID sensor module circuit to read the student's ID and check with a database, and the student, who is in the database, can use the Keypad.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Circuit connection in RFID sensor has a problem because of a voltage problem.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We have many ways to improve and advance our project in the future for better services to users. It gives a cheaper price with practical performance in our college life.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: RFID sensor circuit design and connection with the Putty to save our output data. Also, we learned about leadership and teamwork between engineers.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for U-Desk: We will replace the simple display to OLED touch Display for note-taking during the class and save those to a wireless connection(or Clouding UI system) by designing an app to the user. Thus, it will make the educational environment more digitalized and convenience.
