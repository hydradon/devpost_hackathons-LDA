                    Our health should be one of the top priorities in life, especially in this age where we are able to accomplish and have so many fulfilling experiences. In a world of constantly increasing information, it is easy to become overwhelmed with data and confused over many aspects of staying or even how to start to be healthy. Therefore, we created this website to provide general nutrition information in an easy to read format targeted for individuals based on age and biological sex. While this cannot be substituted for a comprehensive guide to perfect health, we present information on essential nutrition as well as corresponding food suggestions to meet the recommended intake from the

                    Nutrition and health is different for everyone and depend on a variety of factors, some of which include our age and biological sex. For example, a growing 2 year old toddler will not have the same nutrition needs as an 32 year old adult. Female and male bodies are also built differently and therefore will also differ in needs.

                    We found that finding basic health information is actually quite time consuming and confusing due to the sheer amount of information available as well as other factors. Articles conflict so it can be difficult to find reputable sources. Even with reputable studies, data can be cluttered so it can become troublesome to find the relevant information pertaining to you, or even to simply understand with medical jargon. To help remedy this, we sorted data and information to be more specific and easier to read for individuals.

                    Designing and creating a website from scratch is something that was new to some of us, and doing that process within a single weekend was definitely new for all of us. Finding actual nutrition information to use took quite a while, which is exactly one of the reasons why we started this project. We also learned to use Bulma for framework css and integrated javascript to personalize options for age and biological sex. We struggled to create a usable layout that was also mobile friendly. Getting started and knowing how to start from scratch and working together was our initial challenge, but our main challenge was actually the time limit and getting a product that can be submitted. While our final submission is a website far from finished or what we planned, we are happy that we finally got to the point that we have something to submit for our first hackathon project.
