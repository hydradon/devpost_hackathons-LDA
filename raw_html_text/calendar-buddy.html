                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all had events on our calendar that affected other events and we wanted to find a way to optimize this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives users the ability to order events based on significance, mental/physical fatigue, as well as indoor/outdoor attributes to each event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used javascript, multiple calls to APIs, HTML, and CSS to build the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran in to many challenges while trying to learn how to use these APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we got a basic prototype working for the project as well as got API calls to work as well. We were able to build a basic Calendar application in just a couple days in a language that we previously do not have experience in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use javascript, API calls, and HTML/CSS in our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Calendar Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to work on expanding the project in the next couple week and release our idea to the public.
