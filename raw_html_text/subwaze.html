                <p>
                    While we were traveling to HackNY, we noticed how Google Maps/ MTA app provides unreliable transportation information.

                    Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Similar to Waze, our project Underwaze takes user input into account to provide real-time updates on transportation information. We use tokens as an incentive for users to provide a response. Users will have to spend 1 token for each search, which can be earned back if he/ she provides a response.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we have accomplished
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We established the token transaction system 
2) We linked multiple sources to bring the best of real time data available 
3) We created a basic system that will take in user feedback. User's input will be prioritized over MTA statistics when &gt;2 users agree on an item. We have made it easier to see whether a train has been delayed.

                    Time. It was not 24 that was said to be. It was about 20 hours.

                    It runs and looks nice. We tried, and slept a total of 1 1/2 hours combined.

                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Sleep is for the weak. A lot of javascript, python, and fuzzywuzzy. (Keep improvising)

                    What's next for UnderWaze

                <p>
                    Giving more reliable route information
1) if there is construction, leading to scheduled route changes 
Giving more reliable time prediction:
We're asking for 2 questions "Was the train on time", "Was the train crowded (too packed you cannot go on)"
1) If the train is too crowded, we'll add wait time. We'll assume that each user will have to wait for at least one train.
-- More time is needed to develop comprehensive solutions for these, but sketch ideas suggest that the two questions are enough to address the following scenarios.
2) If there is an emergency, leading to sudden stops or delays. 
3) if the train goes out of commission, leading to a "lost train" problem
