                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created this game from experiences in our own lives and stories we have heard from other women in tech.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a game designed to show the obstacles that women face when attempting to pursue a career in STEM fields. From classrooms with only guys in them, to sexist teachers and bosses that undermine women&rsquo;s confidence, our game tries to demonstrate the struggles that women face in STEM careers. With our game, we try to break the stereotype that women drop out of STEM fields or don&rsquo;t pursue STEM careers because they are incapable of understanding STEM or they are unable to compete with men. The situations posed to the player of the game show that however hard you try and however passionate you are about STEM, it is difficult to overcome the oppressive environment that women face and that is why so many women drop out or don&rsquo;t pursue STEM careers.

                <p>
                    We built it with Python.

                <p>
                    Time constraints made it difficult to accomplish everything we wanted.

                    We are proud of accomplishing all that we did in such a short amount of time. Also we are proud of how well we worked together in a team and how we all met new people.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We expanded our skills with Python and cooperation in a team.

                    What's next for STEMpower
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that STEMpower will share the experiences of women in tech and break the stereotype that women are naturally incapable of succeeding in STEM.
