                    After being fed up with going to the same study spot day after day, we realized that there needed to be a better way to find places to study.

                <h2>
                    StudySpaces allows users to add pins on a map in their favorite study space. Users also define the hours open, can add photos, and can rate the study spot.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We used Android Studio and the Google Maps api for all of our map and UI needs. We used DynamoDB to store the data from the pins so they are visible to all users.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We all started off with little to no android experience, so the learning curve posed the biggest problem. We also had several issues running emulators on our computers, and had to resort to using our phone which wasn't too convenient.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We are proud of the work we have accomplished thus far considering our android skills just 24 hours ago. In addition, we were able to gain a solid understanding of the GoogleMaps API and the DynamoDB data storage service.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned a lot about the basics of android and the basics of the GoogleMaps API, an API that will surely be useful in the future.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We will work on refining the app and completing our vision for the project before we add more features to the App.
