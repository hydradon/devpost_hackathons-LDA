                    After many countless hours of working, we came up with the idea and the implementation of TripMatch, a trip matching platform built on top of Amadeus' amazing platform.

                <p>
                    Trip Match finds your perfect "date." Trip Match inspired by Tinder lets users choose a place to travel by just simple swipes. Looking at photos, it is all up to you whether you like the place or not. Even though there is various service that offers you travel information, the more information you have, the harder it becomes to decide where and when you will go on a trip. So, TripMatch asks you only simple information and shows you photos of sightseeing places. You just follow your intution and Trip Match will find the best match/date/plan for you! Using Machine Learning algorithms, we can show you the best place for you to go, so let&rsquo;s find a match!

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Due to API limitations, we can only use MAD as an outbound city. So please use that city when selecting the origin!
Thank you!
