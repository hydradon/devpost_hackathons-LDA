                    We built this app on the android platform. We used 'Firebase' for authentication.  We used Payment API from Finastra for facilitating the payment. We also build app server (Ninja Payment server) for facilitating the payment and interfacing with Finastra API. Also we built the functionality to add 'Smiley Points' with every exchange.
