                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole idea became on our head one day while we were visiting la Sagrada familia here in Barcelona. We tried to take a picture but there was always someone else standing in front and photobombing our own picture. We thought it could be cool to have an App able to remove people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During a period of time, this app will take several photographs and erase the non constants from the final result.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build this app during the HackUPC Fall 2016 using android studio and our knowledge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with images and managing information of several big images at the same time without running out of memory
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a first beta able to remove people.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned tons of stuff we did not know about android, about memory managing, about bitmaps and image processing in general.
                </p>

                    What's next for TouristEraser
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next goal would to parallelize the application and make the calculations far more faster using the several threads we have on our mobile available.
