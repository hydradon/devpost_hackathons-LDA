                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our parents are immigrants. The Canadian heritage challenge made the most sense to us in terms of finding a solution to the issue of "isolation" faced by new comers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One conversation with our chatbot has the potential to increase opportunities for collaboration and cooperation between English-speaking and French-speaking individuals in Quebec by facilitating a friendly event in an equal footing environment. Nonetheless, the app also incorporates features from the Canadian Heritage prototype mobile app.
