                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love music and since Arvind can't play any instruments we wanted to let him know what it feels like without actually learning anything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows a set of instruments and lets the user control their volume with hand movements and sharp glances at the instruments.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Good question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The virtual reality part is built with Unity engine and ran on an Android phone using Google Cardboard, the music was produced in different tracks by a former team member that we don't speak of anymore. Unity communicates with the leap motion through a web service, by constantly pulling data that is being posted by a JS script listening on the inputs from leap motion. If this seems off, you're right.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge was getting the unity app communicate with the leap motion. Since' we're all pretty bad at networking and bluetooth is a deep forest we didn't dare to go into, we decided to use an intermediary for the communication, which ended up being a web service.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We made it work! It's not perfect by any means, but it works and that feels good.

                            There's always a way to make something work, even though it might not be great, but it's a good start and can be improved later.
