                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As avid sports players and gamers, we wanted to create a game that would bridge the gap between the two genres and put it together. Therefore, we created a golfing FPS game available on iOS. We wanted to create an app that was easily accessible to us. In order to achieve this we created a mobile game, so we could access our game anywhere and at anytime.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The objective of FPS Golf is to shoot the correct enemy into the "golf hole." This is done in a way similar to an FPS, where you shoot the enemy to move it. Upon completing this objective it will move to the next level. The enemies all have special properties and AI script.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this in the Unity engine, for iOS devices and built it with Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The enemy AI in our second level refused to work despite the code being very similar between levels. We spent alot of time making a completely new AI until we found out we forgot to place in a game object that would allow the entire scene to run.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our enemy AI and damage scripts, as they were made very well and can be used for a large variety of different enemies, without needing to recode. We are also proud of how our objects interact with the shooting in the game. Throughout the game there are multiple shootable objects, which when shot, fall over and move realistically. This drastically helps give our game a more realistic and professional feel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are new to c#, and so we managed to learn the basics and even some advanced applications of the language. In addition to this, Xcode was a new software program we have never used before, as this was our first time building to iOS devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fps Golf
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for FPS Golf is to keep improving the core game mechanics and adding more challenging levels to create a more immersive and complete game.
