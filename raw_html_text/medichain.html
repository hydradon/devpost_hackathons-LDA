                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After some research, we learned that our medical identity and history are vulnerable to black-hat hackers and those who wish to penetrate medical institutions like walk-in clinics, hospitals, and, most importantly of them all, insurance companies. We want to give you more control over the data that matters to you the most by allowing you to personally choose who gets to see your data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MediChain is a service for individuals to easily and securely provide their medical history to medical institutions to an unprecedented degree of control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We leveraged Keybase's end-to-end encrypted chat and file system capabilities to efficiently control who has access to your medical data. Using a keybase bot written in python, individuals interact with the keybase bot through text and granting access to files while your medical professionals see a more detailed medical history with a seamless process to update your medical history through a website served by flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything. Keybase, flask, python, jinja, we were complete beginners to blockchain and ran into constant struggles, even developing applications we thought we were familiar with.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Putting together an MVP despite having so little experience in the field
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keybase, perseverance, flask + buddies, asynchronous programming in python,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MediChain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add a lot of features like personalized analytics to help individuals learn more about their medical concerns, develop a better display for patients and doctors to interact with each other.
