                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The U.S. Government Accountability Office found that
                    <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/680/673128.pdf" rel="nofollow">
                        about three-quarters of eighth grade students were not proficient in geography in 2014, and had shown no improvement since 1994.
                    </a>
                    This compelled me to do something to solve this problem, so I created Stamp My Passport, a fun Alexa skill students can use to learn geography. Stamp My Passport teaches kids the name and location of countries in each continent along with their capitals and national languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When users enter the skill, they choose to learn countries from one of six continents: North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Then, they receive questions showing a picture of a country and asking for its name. The game starts with multiple choice questions giving the language and capital of a country. Once the user gets these questions correct, they move on to short-answer questions with no hints. If a user gets a country right without any hints, they get a stamp for that country on their passport.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other features include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ask to show the location of a country. "Show me Libya"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create unique passports for each user in the household. "Create a passport"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Delete passports. "Delete a passport"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pick a continent. "North America"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pick a mode. "Learn" to learn, "Review" to review stamped countries
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pick both a mode and a continent. "Learn/Review North America"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ask for help on the game rules. "Help"
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition, there are personalized Amazon Polly voices for each continent, and the number of stamped countries is shown on the screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The skill is released in all regions supporting English (U.S., Canada, U.K., India, and Australia).

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built Stamp My Passport using the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Node.js. I hosted the skill using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APL was new to me, and I had to take a lot of time to understand it thoroughly. Additionally, I had to figure out how to efficiently download maps, attribute them to their authors correctly, and write out all the logic in my backend code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stamp My Passport is usable on all Echo devices, including Spot, Show, and TV, as well as the voice-only Echo/Dot/Plus. I was able to accomplish this by sending cards to the Activity tab of the user's Alexa app in lieu of displaying an image on the screen. Initially, I faced challenges getting the map large enough to view on a Spot, but eventually I was able to get it done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also proud that I was able to incorporate Amazon Polly voices in my skill to represent each of the different continents of the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about how to use APL, a new technology I had never experienced before. I also had a fun time learning all the countries in the world!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stamp My Passport
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to make a version of Stamp My Passport that supports Echo Buttons, so users in the same household can play against each other to guess countries correctly. I might add this mode as an in-skill purchase for users who want the added level of competition. I could also feature scheduling and reminders so users can plan to learn a set number of countries each week and improve their learning.
