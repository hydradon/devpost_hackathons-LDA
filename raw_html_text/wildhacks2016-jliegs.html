                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a chrome extension which can block NSFW images will help tons of people from fraudulent websites and make their internet experience better overall.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blocks NSFW images and learns what a user considers NSFW (through the Clarifai API) in order to create a safe online search environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Clarifai API and trained it with hundreds of onlines pictures to give us an accurate representation of which pictures are NSFW and which pictures are not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a huge problem connecting our Chrome extension to the Clarifai API since one used Javascript and the other was written in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the purpose of our project, to make online browsing a safe environment for everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Chrome development and learned how to quickly deploy our extensions to solve problems.
                </p>

                    What's next for NSFW Blocker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to grow our NSFW Blocker to take into account videos and gifs which might be suspicious.
