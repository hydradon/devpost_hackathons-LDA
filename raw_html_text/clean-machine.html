                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a music playing application that would be able to censor bad words from the music as it plays.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently it acts like a music player akin to Spotify
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java's swing and JavaFX for the GUI, as well as Java in the backend
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came across a lot of challenges concerning the formats of music files and how we would read the metadata from them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app runs very fluidly because of how the GUI uses an observer pattern to ensure that everything is up-to-date. As well as the fact that the backend is completely independent of the GUI,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Java GUIs as well as object-oriented design patterns.
                </p>

                    What's next for Clean Machine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will pursue "cleaning up" the songs while they're being played. As well as touching up on certain parts of the application - such as being able to filter by albums and artists, making a nicer looking GUI, and even
