                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My curiosity and love for nature and plants. I also wanted to learn more about machine-learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses machine learning to identify and classify types of flowers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Xcode built an iOS application using Core ML framework in Swift SDK to integrate machine learning models into the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compile error when implementing the framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was able to classify five different types of flowers and deploy a fully functional app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    About to train a machine learning model and how to implement Core ML in Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flower Power
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we get to add more plants and flowers so people can enjoy and learn more about plants.
