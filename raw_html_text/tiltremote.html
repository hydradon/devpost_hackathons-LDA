                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for our hack arises from the common issue of watching something on your laptop that's hooked up to a T.V. To control your T.V. you must go to your laptop and scroll with the trackpad to interface with it.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack lets you use your phone to control your laptop's cursor acting as a remote control.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using UDP, Java, Python, and Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were two major challenges we ran into. The first one was the actual math behind the angles and mapping it to the 2D screen of the laptop. The second issue was actually implementing the UDP as none of our team members were experienced in it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of overcoming the aforementioned challenges and actually completing our hack.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about UDP, Android, phone's sensors, and controlling computers with codes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TiltRemote
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to improve our hack by decreasing latency, correcting jittering, and adding functionality like using the phone's keyboard to type things.
