                <p>
                    It has a student login, whereby a logged-in student can leave reviews or comments about various courses from school. If a course is not already on the site, students can add courses, by including the course code and course title, along with all of the course's instructors. Other features include a search bar that allows the user to narrow down his/her desired course, and the ability to edit/delete reviews that you've previously left about a course or prof.

                <p>
                    This page is different from sites like ratemyprof.com because students comment on the course itself. All students currently taking a course can then look through the feedback for it and can compare different profs of the same course, all under a single page, rather than having a different page for each prof.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the MEN stack for the development of the web, along with front-end tools like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble figuring out how to get our website hosted onto the domain we received from Domain.com.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with full-stack development, and how to transform an idea into a fully-fledged website.
