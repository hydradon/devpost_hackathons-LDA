                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came with the desire to experiment and learn something new. We saw the challenges available, and were intrigued by the Dragonboards that were available, as well as the Alexa devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the front end, all user input is audio-based, and is processed by Alexa. Within the game skill, the user can select from a variety of inputs, including spinning the wheel or guessing a letter for the puzzle. After receiving the input, Alexa processes it and determines the intended action of the user. Depending on the input, Alexa asks for any extra required information of the action, and then calls an AWS Lambda function. This function sends the intended action's instruction to the Dragonboard, where a C-based graphical interface on a LCD screen shows the wheel spinning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Amazon's SDK in conjunction with Amazon Web Services, we were able to construct the user-to-Alexa dialog tree and enable successful passthrough of the correct function calls to the Dragonboard, which handled all of the graphical components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon's development tools relied heavily on node.js, a language that none of our team was familiar with. Heavy use of documentation and Amazon's GUI were needed to achieve intended results. Additionally, communication between Alexa, the AWS cloud, and the Dragonboard proved to be much more difficult than we expected. As a result, we were unable to implement the game logic or the full extent of the graphical output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa dialogue worked sufficiently well, and the AWS server was successfully able to receive instructions from Alexa and route them to the Dragonboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An application using numerous development tools in combination with each other can be tough maintain, as the tools has to be able to communicate with each other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Implementation of multiple players, a stricter and more authentic ruleset, and a fleshed out game logic.
