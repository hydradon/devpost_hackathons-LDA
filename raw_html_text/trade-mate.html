                    Our submission for Hack GSU
So basically, every user has an account where they may be able to post items that they are willing to lend/sell. Other students with accounts from the same college can see these posts and indicate to use/buy those particular items. The entire system works similar to a generic shopping app, except that the items being sold consist mainly of items that college students would be most likely to use.

                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration originated from the recognition that professors in college sometimes are not able to provide students with all the assets necessary for being successful in college. However, some students have possession of resources that could be useful to other students, and to take advantage of this fact, we decided to create an app so that students can all have an opportunity to be successful.

                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We learned all about how to use Google Cloud and Google Firebase to set up realtime databases and authenticate users without needing to deal with any of the stress ourselves. This project also relied on us finding new repositories to use and expand our capabilities of the app.
