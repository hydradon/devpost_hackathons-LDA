                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were brainstorming together in a team for an idea, we remembered about a Facebook App of Krak&oacute;w's board-gaming cafe, HEXSpot (available
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HEXspot/app_632295200194659" rel="nofollow">
                        here
                    </a>
                    ). The app makes it possible to reserve a table in that cafe and choose if You want to sit close to the bar or in a peaceful place far away from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We thought it was kind of a unique possiblity and decided to build a general solution for this, which could be used by many restaurants, bars, bilard clubs and basically anything that can be considered reservable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What did we achieve
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to achieve the basic functionality - the core part of it is a Venue creator, which lets representatives of restaurants to create a bird's-eye view of different parts of their venue. Later, this view is presented to the people which intend to reserve a table in the venue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it with Python Django in backend and web technologies HTML5/CSS3/JS in the front, using jQuery and Bootstrap, among others. Personally, I was responsible for the front-end - mainly on the venue creator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to develop with PHP with Laravel framework in the backend, but we wanted a fourth person to our team. Because we found some person who knew Python Django, we changed our plans (and planned team functions), and started to configure Django. We finished about 3 am on Saturday, and the person who joined us went to reinstall Linux in his home, and we never heard about him since. Pretty harsh, especially because of the time we spent to switch to Django ;)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Sleeping only 3 hours during the whole competition

                    What's next for Take a Seat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should add more elements (Door, Bar, custom element, etc.) as well as polishing it, because the way it is written right now is strictly-hackathonish :)
