                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When driving in the car with my children, this is the game that stops the fights, quiets them down and brings on the mental battles.  What a perfect voice app, we all love animals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Guess the animal challenges you to listen to the clues and guess the correct animal. I launched the app in 2016 without ISP and it did really well.  The latest launch introduces Animal-Packs, groups of 20 questions for animals from a particular region that expand the number and variety of animals available for Guess The Animal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned Node.js, learned how to set up an AWS Lambda service to integrate with a custom Alexa app, utilized the Alexa v2 SDK, integrated with AWS S3 for picture hosting and integrated with Alexa In Skill Purchases.  I created purchasable In-Skill Products and linked them to my skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa team makes it pretty easy to create a skill and hook it up to the AWS Lambda function.  It was a little challenging setting up the display templates to work with the new Alexa screen enabled apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I first launched the app, it reached 40,000 unique users in 30 days.  It was amazing how many people could play guess the animal with no distribution efforts on my part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You never know what app, game, skill or business might take off.  Keep working hard and put your plans in motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Guess The Animal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More animal packs, and market testing as to which enticing presentation of our In-Skill purchases generates the most sales.
