                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way banks use our money has always been something that people are kept in the dark about. The way that a bank is able to make money is by taking part of your money and then investing it in areas where they are able to make a profit and then return the remainder into your bank account. So what if the bank is using your money in areas where you aren't comfortable with, what if you had a say in which industry your money could be used. What if you could easily donate money to charity directly from the app. And what if you have dependents and want a way to be able to monitor and easily transfer money to those that are dependent on you.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app provides a way to select where you would like your bank to use your money, this could be because of personal or relegious beliefs. Our app has an area which should have a charity page with a list of all the charities nearby. And also provides a unique experience with having the family option

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built mainly using html and css for the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transferring files was not efficient as no one was experienced with using github.
All the team members were of basic level so we struggled to get everyone to a similar level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to come up with the idea pretty quickly and had a design and specification made for it pretty quickly. The execution could have been better but considering the experience level, we were able to make up quite a lot of it through teamwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt that we could make up for each others weaknesses by giving someone who had more experience that task and as a result were able to divide the tasks equally.
                </p>

                    What's next for AHZU Banking
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably by developing a bit more of the bankend and get it functional and ready for commercial use.
Another thing which we were not able to get to was being able to have a messaging tool built in the app, in case help is required we will try considering that for the future apps.
There are a few more ideas but those are probably higher up on the list.
