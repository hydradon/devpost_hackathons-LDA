                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea was inspired by listening to Cindy Lennon and Sean Cannon recount the struggles of Veterans with families trying to better themselves with professional development opportunities, but finding there was a lack of affordable childcare services geared towards military families.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website offers a platform that allows Veteran families access to free-child care services by facilitating meet-ups between veterans  to essentially &ldquo;swap kids&rdquo; for a few hours at a time.  It is a short-term service that offers more than just babysitting&mdash;they provide social interaction, parental support, community involvement, and long-lasting friendships.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using front and back-end development utilizing Visual Studio Code, Javascript, Express.js, Node.js, and Adobe Spark.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced difficulties when deciding on the logistics and process behind  screening new applicants to ensure that those who use our service are from the Veteran community, and mitigating concerns on entrusting new individuals with their children.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with a unique concept that we felt hadn&rsquo;t been addressed. We are proud of our collaboration as a team to unify all the elements that are part of fleshing out a functional website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The additional challenges that Veteran families face when finding affordable childcare resources. We also learned about all the elements it takes to build a straightforward and user-friendly web-page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Child Share
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;d like to finalize the website build, and find a way to locally promote the service.Given time, we&rsquo;d also like to potentially develop an app for parents on the go.
