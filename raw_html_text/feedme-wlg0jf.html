                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever since we were kids, we have been lazy people. But as adults who can make applications we realized our laziness can benefit other people. So we created an app where lazy people like us can get on campus food delivered straight to us, while people not as lazy as us can make money by delivering that food. So it's a win-win situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an app where you login with your StudentID and Password and choose to either order or deliver food and is accordingly guided to a view. From there you can choose what you want to order and any of the available delivery people will pick up your order and deliver it to you.
So for the case of University of Rochester, a student orders some kind of food or beverage with their declining (UofR food debit) and we charge a small amount of their declining as the delivery fee based on how far they are from the store. This delivery fee which is declining deposits in the delivery person's account. The orderer also will have the choice to leave a tip. That way by delivering people can save up declining to order themselves.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and Django REST Framework for the backend and Swift for the iOS app. Please go to the user_view brach of the iOS to view the code since we didn't merge to the master.

                    We started a day later and googled a lot, didn't sleep and had to go through a lot of stack overflow searching.
