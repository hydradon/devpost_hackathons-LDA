                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reality Ministries offers numerous programs and events, which are attended by over 400 active participants and volunteers. However, less than 5% drive themselves, meaning people tend to have difficulty finding reliable transportation.

                <p>
                    Our app, HandOff, offers a ridesharing/carpool service with many other features, including a community messaging platform. This application also consists of an event planning and heat-mapping feature to get a live count of the number of volunteers at a location. We have chosen the following features to implement during our development cycle of 12 hrs today and some features have been left for future upgrades.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, collectively, we made a mockup of the app to determine how the app would function and the features it would include. From there, we split into teams for the front-end, back-end, and mockup. The back-end team found and incorporated different APIs to implement the numerous features our app provides. The front-end team started front-end programming using various bootstraps. Starting from the home page, they planned and implemented each section. From there, they created linked pages such as the login page, the registration page, and the driver/rider profiles. Finally, we linked the backend to the frontend and registered a domain name to host our website.

                <p>
                    Many members of our team were new to web development, so a lot had to be learned on the fly. Many new APIs were investigated and utilized, and we learned to register and host a website.
