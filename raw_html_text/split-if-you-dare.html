                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came to Junction to have some fun. We wanted to build a playable app with some social interactions. The app that you can enjoy with your friends. That is why we present "Split! if you dare".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you have a meeting with your friends in the restaurant and it finally comes to pay the bill you can use our app to mitigate this sad duty.
When you open our application, you can start a simple game. You put the bill cost, send it to our api via Split! and that is where the fun begins. All you friennds can join your game through unique game code. You can start on the same ground(evenly split bill across participants), or each person gives his own proposition of paying the part of the bill(based on they orders). As a result we get a list with nicknames and starting contribution to pay the bill e.g:
                </p>
                <p>
                    bill: 100USD
Jack 30USD(30% of the bill)
John 20 USD(20%)
Ann 30 USD(30%)
Paul 20USD(20%)
                </p>
                <p>
                    When all players join the game, few minigames start(number is based on "organizer" input). Games are based on reflex, mathematical knowledge and much more. We have created the framework to easy implement new minigames. After each game, all members have their part of the bill changed based on the result of preceding minigame. It depends on the time of reaction and the correctness of the answer. When he game ends, all particpants know how much they need to add or substract from the payment. Is it fun? Absolutely!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed web api to operate the whole system. Android users just need to create, or join game. All minigames are started at the same time. We did that because all request are performed simultaneously. The only delay depends on your network connection. To balance the oportunity to win, all time measuring  is done by your android phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn how to program android apps, build web API, define minigames and create smart solution to easy implement new minigames. We had a lot of troubles with android/web communication and synchronizing mutiple request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created framework to build new games. We made our own Android app system controler. Our biggest problem as assurrace the same rules for everybody. We had to made app sensitive to timing. All androids had to start "minigame" at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnead a lot about android structure, communication to web sockets, building beatiful itnerfaces and much more. We know that this knowledge will pay in the future. For most of us Android was a big unknow, and now it is only "the small problem" to understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Split! if you dare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to share our app in Google store. Also we have a chance to build IOS app. 
Of course we need to implement huge amount of mini games. Our heads are full of new ideas.
