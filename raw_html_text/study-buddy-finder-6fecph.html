                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often want to study with others for tests and such but our schedules don't line up with people we know. Thus, we developed a way to connect classmates together who may not know each other to study together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New members create an account (existing members log in) and create study groups on the browse page. Everyone else on the app can see the listings and come to the specified location and time to meet up and study together. There is also a chat function built-in so people can ask questions, make comments, etc. Finally, there is an editable profile page if you want to change your information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to make the app and used GitHub desktop to collaborate with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges were having the chat box (recyclerview) and the drop-down menus (spinners) show up. We also had trouble integrating the member pictures into the profile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to connect the front end and back end, and ultimately creating a useful app that can help students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about how to use Android Studio as well as what it takes to collaborate on a single project together (many, many errors when combining!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Study Buddy Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add more features (such as being able to join a group) as well as make this app look nicer.
