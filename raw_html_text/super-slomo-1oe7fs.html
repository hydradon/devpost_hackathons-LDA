                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found an opensource project on github for creating slow motion videos using machine learning.

                        link
                    </a>
                    We found that this could be slow locally, and unapproachable for the average person. We decided to create a responsive website where users could leverage the cloud to create a slow motion video, and then download or share it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website, if functioning fully, should take a short video clip and run Python in the cloud to create a slow motion version and offer it to the user for download or sharing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built on top of the opensource code. We started by creating a very basic application with plain HTML, where locally we could send videos from the front to the back end. Then we uploaded that to the cloud. Once we ensure that the basic application is working, we'll connect a more sophisticated front end.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite sounding like a simple project, we ran into many challenges during this process. We spent a lot of time learning how to set up google cloud platform with database functionality. Then, we spent a lot of time learning and struggling to make python accept user-uploaded media files and give those back to the user on the next HTML page. Currently, we're pushing to upload our basic version of the application to GCP and have it run in the cloud.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot during this hackathon. We managed to compromise and work as a group, despite the fact that 2 of the members had never really used Github before. We weren't afraid to use trial and error to resolve our problems, and when that didn't work, we weren't afraid to leverage mentors to help us out. We overcame many of our challenges using these methods, and while it might not be done for the hackathon, we're proud of how far we've come.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that even simple ideas can have a lot of complexity, especially when you add the cloud. We learned about google cloud platform with no prior experience. We learned about connecting front and back ends. And we learned to trust other members with our code and even our hardware when necessary.

                <p>
                    Right now, we're working on getting it onto Google Cloud Platform. Once that works, we plan to attach a better front end and embellish it.
