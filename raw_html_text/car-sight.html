                    Car maintenance is always a disliked event. Especially when the mechanic tells you that you could have prevented this costly repair if you had done it sooner. If I knew I would have done it sooner, but there is no one telling me that I needed that specific maintenance. That is why we are developing Car Sight
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is an application for Ford Company, Dealers and owners. The project is using internet of things, machine learning and predictive and prescriptive analysis to foresee car failures before they happen. There are two aspects to this project. The first part is the android app that syncs with Ford Sync. The app has the intelligence to record driving behaviors to predict what type of maintenance is needed. Users will receive a notification of what maintenance is needed due to what driving behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the company and dealers, the information recorded from the new app is valuable information. Using Machine learning models, utilizing predictive and prescriptive models, and real time data from the Ford Sync dealers can observe the behavior of their vehicles. Then recommend service based on driving behavior. This is a powerful tool that can transform this data into powerful analytics that can help not only Ford owners, but as well dealers. Dealers have the power to see potential maintenance needed on the car and recommend their service department to fix it.

                    The application was built with android studio and the machine learning models were built on Microsoft Azure ML.

                <p>
                    Integrating different companies APIs onto the android application. As well as gathering all the data to build the predictive analytic dashboard that utilizes machine learning models.

                <p>
                    Created a successful application that syncs directly to Ford's Sync and designed a machine learning model that could predict driving behavior.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Working on this project the team and I learned how to work together to get a project completed. Also we had the opportunity to learn about the different technologies offered by the sponsors and brainstorming how it could all fit together into one  project.

                <p>
                    Continue refining the application and adding more features to it. As Cars are more connected the app will have the potential to grow and be the next proactive maintenance system for cars.
