                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over half of all patients, who stop doing their exercises, stop coming to appointments, and stop getting better. Physical Therapy is hard &ndash; doctor's visits are inconvenient, their expensive, and it's just painful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the reasons go deeper than this. Patient's experience this pain is part of a feedback loop in a downward spiral of becoming frustrated with their illness, embracing denial, and stopping their own treatment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By marrying the latest advances in wearable technology and data science Flexa is able to intervene in this loop before it starts and deliver better patient outcomes that are cheaper and easier for everyone involved. Let me show you how.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are millions of people walking around the world today getting feedback about how to live better lives from smart devices, from watches, to jewelry to your phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a patient has their first visit with their physical therapist, rather than assigning painful exercises and asking for a promise the patient that they'll do them, patients are given one of these trackers.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to build a web app initially with live-streaming data based on a prototype built with Sketch and Invision prototyping tools.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Issues with collecting accurate accelerometer data.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being our first hackathon, we like the unique market fit of our idea.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure that data collection is feasible, accurate, and amenable to a live demonstration.
