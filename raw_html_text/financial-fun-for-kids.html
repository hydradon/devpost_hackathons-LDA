                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Financial literacy is an important life skill that unfortunately, not many of us learn until too late. That's why it's important to start children off early with the skill-set and knowledge to invest and save their money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website is designed to be child-friendly through the incorporation of various memes and gifs of relevant cartoons.  Based on location, we've listed the closest financial institutions (i.e banks and credit unions) that are the closest distance with tips towards their building their financial journey.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used github and sublime to build the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With no knowledge in coding and the use of github, there was a steep learning curve in figuring out how to successfully write the syntax and execute the commands. We would've like to make the website more complex and include information  and comparison charts for other forms of saving accounts (e.g. 401K, IRAS) and investments that are relevant for families .

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact we were able to get the site up and running,since our team did not come from a CS Background.
                </p>
