                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NPR.org states that educating English Language Learners in English as well as in many other subject areas is one of the biggest challenges facing the public education system today. However, although this issue is incredibly prevalent in our increasingly diversifying country, our already overworked teachers do not have the manpower to give these students the extra assistance that they need to succeed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EnglishAide provides a safe and monitored environment for students to supplement their English studies by participating in engaging and stimulating conversation with our mentors. Teachers can track their students' progress, as well as add suggestions for areas our mentors should focus on with the students
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react-native to simultaneously create an app for both the iPhone and android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with formatting both iPhone screens and Android screens  at the same time and with the messaging portion of the app that is one of the app's main focuses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are incredibly proud of our idea. English Language Learners are making up a growing percentage of the education system's landscape however the resources to support them have not grown proportionately. All of our members have friends or family who are affected by this situation so it made working on the project all the more personal and special.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned react-native in order to complete the project and now have it as a skill we can walk away with.
                </p>

                    What's next for EnglishAide

                <p>
                    More debugging and increased functionalities to better serve English Language Learners.
