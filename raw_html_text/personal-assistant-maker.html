                    Creates a personal companion for a '7-day' demo. After creating the assistant, there are a couple functions such as giving words of inspiration depending on your mood or just a regular schedule keeping function.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the little knowledge we had in python and lots of creative dialogue.

                    What we learned

                    Creativity as a goal allows freedom, but hard finding an idea among the millions of choices with freedom
