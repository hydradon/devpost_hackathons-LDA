                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encounter dangers in our lives every single day. In fact, accidents are the leading cause of death in adolescence.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Provides a comprehensive guide to maintaining physical health of yourself and others. Comes in handy for everything from minor injuries to drastic emergencies.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we did research on CPR, Heimlich maneuvers, injuries, motor injures, poisoning, and muscle soreness. After compiling techniques to treat and care for these situations, we compiled it into an app in Android Studio. You can take these tips with you anywhere you go!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we had trouble formatting the text in android studio. As a result, we were not able to add every section we wanted to; however, we only had to cut out the motor injuries and poisoning section. In addition, it was quite difficult to add in extra features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It looks aesthetically decent. In addition, we are really proud we made an app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Sublime Text 3, Markdown, Visual Studio, and Android Studio. In the end, we stuck with Android Studio. Learning how to make an app was fun.
                </p>

                    What's next for EverydaySurvival
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to put in more section, clean up the formatting, add in images, and add in more utilities, such as a flashlight.
