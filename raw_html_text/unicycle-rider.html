                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all spent our middle school days playing "canvas rider" online and we thought it would be a great idea to re make one of our favorite childhood games.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Your goal is to reach the end of the course being a unicycle rider. You have to watch where you are going meanwhile trying to stay balanced. It is very difficult at first and takes some time to get used to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we built it using an online python programming environment that allows python to be run in a browser. We started from scratch to create our game. We first started by importing our image that we photoshopped. We then began to give the unicycle in game mechanics and basic physics such a gravity and staying on the plotted line. We then implemented jumping mechanics that wouldnt allow the user to continue to move while in the air. Once we we able code the basic physics down we moved towards more advanced physics where ballance and slope played an effect in the game. First we implemented acceleration of a slope of a line. Therefor your character would fall up or down a given slope. The next major implementation was the unicycle balancing on the line. We used trig to rotate the unicycle certain degrees due to different user inputs. This implementation makes the game very challenging and fun! The final step was the main menu where you choose what map you would like to play.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our greatest challenge was the unicycle staying on the line along using gravity but not to have the unicycle fall though the line.

                <p>
                    Perhaps we could add different game modes or different ways to play fore example use a bike.
