                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel that there are three main reasons why we all come to university. To Learn, network and enjoy. Being international students at NTU we feel that there is a lack of networking between students. This is a big problem for one of the best universities in the world. We have come up with an app that solves this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows you to create and enjoy events depending on your mood. The objective is to promote student interaction through various meet ups ranging from a casual meal to a trip too Bali. University is known to be the best years of our lives, why waste it?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our webapp using Onsen. With Onsen we can program with HTML, CSS and Javascript and deliver an application that looks like a native app for both Android and IOS. The framework detects the OS of the phone and adjusts all the components to look like native components for that OS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we decided to work with Onsen, we had to investigate how to use the framework properly, through the documentation and sometimes it took hours because the documentation didn&rsquo;t include everything we were looking for.
Also this was our first hackathon. We didn&rsquo;t have a full idea of how this type of competences work and also this was the first time we worked together. We are students from different countries and clearly with different backgrounds. Some were better at some things than the others and at times it was difficult to coordinate and explain to each other what we were doing individually but in the end we were able to have a very good communication and work together in an efficient way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest accomplishments was getting four students from different parts of the world together to hack an idea that truly identifies their personality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work in a competitive environment under the pressure of a deadline. We discovered a very useful framework: Onsen and also how to build a web application from scratch while coordinating with a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hola
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get companies to subscribe to our app so we can provide our students with great deals. This would increase the number of users and provide these companies with clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take our application to other universities in Asia because we feel that this problem is not only in Singapore. The importance of networking is crucial to build a stable and friendly community.
