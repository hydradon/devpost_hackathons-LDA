                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to visualize what can cause certain traits
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes a trait and finds corresponding SNPs which can be used to compare to a reference genome database that finds the surrounding sequence. The sequence is then taken and can be 3D printed with dual extrusion to showcase the casual SNP bp of interest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created small dataframe of traits with corresponding locations in R that can be used to find surrounding sequence by using a human reference genome (any SNP sequence can be found given the coordinates even if not in trait database). Took the associated DNA basepairs and imput it into the DNA sequence to structure program through the Supercomputing Facility for Bioinformatics abd Computational Biology, ITT Delhi which gave us a 3D model. We then imported the file into Chimera to make it into an .STL file. The file was then put into blender and the mutated basepair was highlighted and separated. The whole file was then put into Simplify 3D and dual extruded through a 3D printer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'd like to be considered for best use of a database.
