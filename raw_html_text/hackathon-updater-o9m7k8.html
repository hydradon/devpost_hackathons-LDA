                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something useful and effortless
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You put in information about the hackathon and it longs whatever device you&rsquo;ve chosen it from (apple, android, etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript and we took advantage of .ics files to bypass having to ask for emails
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting bit set up on a web server, manipulating .ics files
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working together as a team and working on a real collaborative effort
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How difficult it is to learn a language or principle in a short time, how to work with diverse skill sets, planning skills, and brainstorming tactics
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hackathon Updater
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;d continued for it to be integrated with the mlh hackathon website in one easy form/button
                </p>
