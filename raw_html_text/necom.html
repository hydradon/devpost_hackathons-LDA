                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The content consumption market it largely controlled by two major companies &ndash; Taboola, OutBrain &ndash; which focus mainly on follow-up recommendation for viewing and reading content, based on the consumers' habits and recently consumed content.
The market's worth is estimated at 200-300M dollars a year (this is only the worth of content-related advertisement). Google (and consequently YouTube) have also joined the market recently, in relation the video consumption by content.
All these companies use information of my previously consumed content to determine what to recommend next, but none consider in what way the content was actually received by the consumer; was it clicked on by accident? Was the consumer disappointed/repelled by the content? I believe this aspect is crucial.
This is why I am developing Necom, which uses feedback from the consumers' brains to determine emotional correlation with content they are exposed to, and perform actions accordingly.

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I implement 3 mainly features: 1) When the system sees that you are straining your eyes too, is changing the screen size respectively. 2) When I see a video on YouTube, and the system detects that I love that video she download it to the device. 3) If I fell asleep while watching a video, the system will stop the video until I wake back.

                    How I built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I builed chrome extension (in javascript) using chrom api and youtube api. I combined it, with data that come from neurosteer sensor, and I preform the result actions on the browser.

                    Challenges I ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    working just 12 hours and alone, using a sensor that is still in the developing stage without any references, and code examples, First time I build a chrome extension, and the first time I used chrome api, youtube api.
Talking in Tnglish!!

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I could not get an EEG sensor that matches the budget, I turned to an Israeli startup, in order to use their product, and eventually I got it.
Working alone and in short time, and still finished what I want.

                    What's next for Necom:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    combine the whole system with VR, using also eye tracking for knowing on which element I'm watching. Using NLP and take the product to work also with articles. Implement the system also on TV. Controlling The entire computer by developing a driver that connected to the extension.
