                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make Rondevu because we are tired of going to the same parties. We know that there are better parties out there and all that is missing is an app to find them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way we want it to work is similar to Reddit and YikYak, where users can upvote and downvote parties based on their quality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with the navigation bar as well as parsing JSON.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of accomplishing most of the basic functionality and a respectable UI given the time we spent on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about android design as well as backend development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rondevu
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on greatly improving the UI, adding more functionality to prevent project X parties, and we plan on adding other events to it.
