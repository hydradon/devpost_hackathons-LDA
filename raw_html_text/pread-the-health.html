                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Access to healthcare is determined by environmental, economic, and sociological factors outside of most people's control. We want to show them what factors in their community are related to better access to healthcare.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website shows users where they can advocate for greater access to healthcare and how they compare to other areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We grabbed datasets from data.world and the City of Austin (Shoutout to UT). We then cleaned the datasets to grab coordinates of geographical features and then built a map to visualize which areas had the most access to healthcare.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cleaning the data took up most of our time. We learned regex quite well.

                    We would like to add more datasets and incorporate more clustering.
