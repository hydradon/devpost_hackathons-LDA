                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always wanted to build a 2d side scroller, as it is always a good way for a beginner to start game development. I also like designing games, so this was an opportunity to show my skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, its just demo pictures built with photoshop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used a large process of shadowing, highlighting, and detailing of textures, and multiple layering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, I would have to restart images due to incorrect scaling and I would sometimes have to erase the white around the sprite due to some issues with photoshop not automatically targeting the white pixels I don't want in the image. At building the landscape, there were times when photoshop would not register the clicks to put down a pixel, resulting in sloppier areas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the immense detail I put into the sprites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use photoshop more extensively and more efficiently to produce better visuals for a product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Adventures of Duckboi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To get the game actually running and out into the public sometime in the future.
