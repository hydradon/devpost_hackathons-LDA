                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As technology progresses, so do the demands. One distinct trend is people's desire for larger and better (and sometimes curved) TVs. However, these large TVs are difficult in terms of space-taking, weight, and cost. Home theatre projectors have therefore been on the rise as a method of resolving this problem. Unfortunately, projectors are limited greatly by the rooms they are in. They rely on specific levels of light, and require a clean white flat surface to project on. This provides an obstacle to usage by the general public, such as students, families, and small business owners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Adaptor resolves the last two issues: Colour can be corrected by a filter from the base projection surface colour, and skew can be calibrate by a perspective inverse algorithm. A 3D printed mount combines the hardware (camera, boards, and projector).

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A raspberry pi with a camera was used to take a snapshot of the wall where we wanted to project our screen. We then used the Dropbox Api to send the images to the laptop for processing. APIs such as OpenCV and SDL were used to do the backend, which heavily involves image processing. Lastly, a new and calibrated image is projected to the wall, so it appears straight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest issue was the integration of the hardware - specifically, the Raspberry Pi component. Physical limitations of the hardware had negative on how the software performed, both in the quality of the data to be captured and the ability to perform as the intensity of the algorithms increased.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    High-end software. Skew calibration fully functional. Colour calibration had good progress. Integrated several different technologies - essentially across 4 APIs and multiple platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New languages (such as C++), new APIs (such as OpenCV and Dropbox).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Adaptor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continued product develop, research analytics, and market launch strategy. Improving technological development and business plan until ready for accelerator.
