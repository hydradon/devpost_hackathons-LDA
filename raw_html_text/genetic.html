                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I just want to make programm which will save peoples time, who want to solve genetic problem.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it solves Genetic problems (Mendel inheritance), for any size. it works like calculator, if you've  worked on genetic problems, you will probably know,  that it takes time to solve, so my solver helps people not to waste that precious time.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I came up with idea, then I just started thinking about algorithm and wrote it.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    The algorithm occurred to be little hard for me, so I tried to get some help from people around me and I got it.

                <p>
                    I am glad that I made it work, the true side of work and the experience which I received would help me in the future. I find people who are also as interested in coding, as I am, it is really exciting.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned different aspects of computer science, from talks you offered us. I saw true side of coding and hacking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Genetic Code
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Genetic Code is a really good Programme, which maybe once help someone. When I was getting ready for my biology exam, I googled to find calculator for solver of genetic problems, but I couldn't find one. So I hope that someone will look for them again and if they use my creation, I will be on a good mood.:D We always try to create something that will change the world but we often forget that there are some minor problems  which should be taken into consideration. If you haven't heard about Mendel: he is known as the father of modern genetics. he described inheritance resemblance, hybridization, by genes, DNA. for example A is yellow a-green, B means big, b - small. if we cross AABB * aabb ( yellow big  with  green small) there is 100% chance that we get yellow big (AaBb). I hope I explained it well.
