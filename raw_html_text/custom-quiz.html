                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the years I have used many study tools to assist in my learning. Ranging from notebooks, post-its, word documents, books, videos, lectures, you name it I've tried it. Apart from one on one tutoring, I've found that the oldest method known to man of just reading is still the most productive, but there are still many distractions in our modern society. When taking notes via pen and paper, you have to spend a lot of time looking back and forth between the book and your pad. This can cause you to lose your train of thought and can actually impair your learning. I thought that there has to be an easier way and that's when I came up with the idea.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Custom quiz allows the user to speak with Alexa to make flashcards or quizzes. Alexa asks if you want to make a new quiz or continue an old one. If you want to continue an older quiz it will ask you the title and pull the associated quiz from the database. If you wanted to make a new quiz Alexa will ask you questions then answers and save them for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created a lambda function that has access to read and write to dynamodb, as well as Alexa. The Alexa skill prompts the input from the users which gets aggregated onto the database, this allows the user to make questions and answer quizzes or flashcards for studying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa no longer has the skill slot of AMAZON.literal, so the exact phrase the user speaks (i.e. the question or the entire answer) is harder to parse. I made a workaround using AMAZON.searchquery which also takes the entire prase and by prompting the use of keywords am able to recover the question or answer from the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am really proud that I stock with the core fundamentals of the project. I wanted something highly scaleable that was easy to use and incorporated the emergence of a NoSQL database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Alexa and NoSQL databases, while also having to think a lot about how the user will not be confused about the process of using this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for custom quiz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is still a lot of work to be done, but what I am most interested in doing is also integrating it with amazon lex so you can talk with it via typing if the user prefers that method, as well as being able to share quizzes and flashcards the users make.
