                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to do this because many people could fake a credit card.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It checks the credit card number to see if it is valid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java using Eclipse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could not make the number long enough due to the limitations of the "long" integer, so we had to use a string.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully got the code to "check" credit card numbers, in that every number you check is going to end up returning that the credit card is not valid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating code too fast and without proper documentation can make it harder to debug, even when it should be a simple enough task of checking a credit card's validity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Credit Card Validity
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could randomly generate credit card numbers that could become valid at some point in time.
                </p>
