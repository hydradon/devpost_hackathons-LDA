                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got inspired by all of the challenges. In our opinion, all of them were really important in terms of smart city and we wanted to implement everything in a single product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can read your mood in certain places. We use face recognition with a combination of open data (noise, pollution, area type etc.).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the app in Figma and created interaction in Protopie. The frontend is built in React (with HERE maps) and the backend is built on top of Node.js in combination with Microsoft Azure APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was to recognize the face and aggregate the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build fully working prototype and also micro site which shows our backend data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about face recognition and we also tried Here maps (partner) for the first time.
                </p>

                    What's next for Stamina
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine that this app can run on the background of your device. You pick it up multiple times per hour and the mood test can run every time you unlock your phone. If the certain % of citizens will use this app, we will be able to collect enough data to point on specific area and problem. By knowing the exact problem, we can easily find a way how to solve it.
