                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cleaner Energy
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built a marketplace to connect people who are producing extra solar energy at their homes/offices to people who are ready to buy cleaner and greener electricity supply to their houses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built an android app in the 24 hours. The app uses hyperledger blockchain api, google maps api, and machine learning api on ibm watson. We could also build an iOS and web app in the future though
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we faced was with our idea formulation. We had to brainstorm a lot before coming up with our amazing idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As student developers, we are proud that in 24 hours, we were able to formulate our idea, and bring our idea to life through an android app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    University education can only provide with the theory. After speaking to a wide variety of mentors, we got to learn that being a master of all trades is what society demands to achieve something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Energy City
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope we can get our idea to people at DEWA, especially those who are responsible for implementing the sham initiative, since our product deals with them directly. It is an advantage to both DEWA, and the stakeholders. Most importantly, it is also helping the environment.
