                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After a road trip to Boston where our multi-car group got split up, we decided to create this application to solve some of the common problems of traveling in a group and compile some of the most important functions of group travel into one accessible platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows you to create a "squad" of people you are traveling with. Within this squad, everyone shares a universal destination that anyone can set, everyone can see the location of other squad members, and everyone can send easy-push status updates (such as "Bathroom Break" or "Getting Gas") that all other members of the squad will receive and see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used django and mongoDB to create a database that would keep track of all users and their respective trip squads. Our app was created in Android Studio, and implements the Google Maps API to

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled a lot to initially setup the database, as well as integrating the Google Maps API into our app along with our personal overlays.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are quite proud of being able to setup the database and developing many of the core communication Routes between the front-end app and the back-end server. Furthermore, Google Maps was integrated quite smoothly and successfully ran some of our initial tests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal about all of the components we used to build this, especially django and mongoDB and the implementation of a database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Squad
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue to flesh out our concept in the future and potentially build a fully-functioning app with our idea.
