                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tired of waiting in long lines at your nearest walk-in clinics for a cholesterol checkup? EyeLab is a non-invasive low, budget solution that performs prescreening for high cholesterol levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Web App and the iOS application uses the IBM Watson Visual Recognition API to find Corneal Arcus - a symptom resulting from high cholesterol. The iOS and Web Apps currently find out if you have high or low cholesterol levels by using the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with blood, sweat, and tears. But more specifically, we used Express, Node.js IBM Watson SDK, HTML5 and bootstrap to make the Web App. The iOS application is built with swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every step of the way was a challenge. But EyeLab never gave up :) 
It was a challenge to build an retrieve data from the custom classifier. Triggering an action point with Node.js was a critical problem in this project.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The iOS application successfully deploys and can make a correct diagnosis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is really hard convert an image into a URL in swift.

                    What's next for EyeLabs
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make diagnosis tools specifically for other eye-related symptoms/diseases such as Conjunctivitis or Glaucoma.
