                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a long flight from London to Los Angeles and we noticed that the corridors on the plane were always crowded with people waiting for their turn to use lavatory. This is was a problem for the flight staff, as well as inconvenient for the passenger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EasyP is a virtual lavatory queue and thus it keeps the corridors empty. Every passenger can reserve the lavatory using the EasyP app from his app or the onflight entertainment terminal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the panasonic aviation API to gather relevant passenger information, such as the seat number and name. And used the device messaging API by thingSpace to connect a sensor that reads out the state of the lavatory door.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing multiple devices with interaction was a key challenge that needed to be solved. And gracefully handled by the publish and subscribe protocol of the device messaging api. Connecting and controlling the inflight media was handled by the panasonic avionics api.
                </p>
