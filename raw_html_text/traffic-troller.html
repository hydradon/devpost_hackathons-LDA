                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to explore Machine Learning and Data Analytics by creating an application that helps lawmakers and traffic authorities in Boston be able to put more traffic lights or enforce more trains/buses in areas that have the most traffic
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the dataset from the Boston.gov website, we analyzed the busiest locations in Boston where people got picked up and dropped off which then creates a map to pinpoint locations where traffic lights should be placed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matlab, and watching lots of videos and tutorials
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out the logic to create the script for the large dataset
