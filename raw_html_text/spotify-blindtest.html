                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always wanted to test ourself, and our musical culture, on our music library. Why not using the Spotify library?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user log in with his Spotify credentials, he gets to see a list go his playlists, he can select one, and a Blind-Test will be launched, (e.g) 10 random songs will be played, one after the other. The user must recognize the artist or the track's name (or both, for more points) of as many songs as possible!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used node-js as a back-end technology.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Discover the mysterious, and absolutely messy world of Web programming...

                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Web Programming. Javascript. Frameworks.

                    What's next for Spotify BlindTest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to continue the project, to polish it perfectly, and deploy it on a server, for everyone, as a showcase of what we can do with the Spotify API.
