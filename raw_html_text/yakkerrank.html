                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Yik yak is the latest and greatest social media and captures the hearts of college students across the country. WE want to analyze the core nature of college students by observing their yik yaks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    YakkerRank mines yaks from various colleges around the country, live, and updates the user with information about the top yaks, most common words and readability scores for each college in an interactive map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask to javascript conversions, database locking and discovering parse API keys to retrieve yaks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mining Yik Yaks and building a sqlite backend to store and analyze the yaks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask sucks. Comments are incredibly helpful. Soylent tastes pretty bad, but has good utility value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for YakkerRank
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even better data processing algorithms, more telling stats, and yik yaks from even more colleges.
                </p>
