                        Inspiration
                    </strong>
                    Inspiration for us was the contact with visually impaired people. After conducting interviews with our friends as well as members of PZN (Polish association of the blind) we wanted to resolve some of the issues they have to deal with each day using the knowledge we gained at the university.

                    <strong>
                        What it does
                    </strong>
                    In simple words it extends the walking sticks range, as well as informs the users about the surroundings.
                    <strong>
                        How do we see it after the hackathon.
                    </strong>
                    We want to develop it onto mobile devices, what is its intended use.
                    <strong>
                        Problems we've encountered
                    </strong>
                    As data scientists we have little experience with front-end development, thus we see the lacks of it onto the implementation of our solution, furthermore we had trouble on developing the solution for a working implementation for mobile devices during the event. I know it's a lot yet we're confident that these hurdles are easy to overcome with better internet connection ;)
