                    When defining a patient in the birthing center, most people immediately think of a newborn. But what about the mother? Care for newborns disproportionately outweighs that of mothers. Within the first year of life, healthy newborns are scheduled for approximately 9 pediatric visits whereas mothers are instructed to visit the gynecologist only once. 60% of reported maternal mortality happens within the first 6 weeks after the baby is born, yet the first postpartum checkup is typically at the 6 week mark. Furthermore, more than 50% of mothers avoid medical visits pertaining to their own health. Our team has created a standardized assessment to simultaneously evaluate mothers alongside their newborn at the pediatrician&rsquo;s office. In order to avoid devaluing the newborn&rsquo;s visit, our method takes a mainly informal interview approach to DECIPHER the woman&rsquo;s physical and mental health. Through this checklist approach, we evaluate for depression, embolism, preeclampsia, infection, cardiomyopathy, and hemorrhaging. Once the patient is evaluated, a referral will be made, if deemed necessary. Our team aims to care for new mothers because they cared for us.
