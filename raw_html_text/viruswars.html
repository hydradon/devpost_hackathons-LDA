                    Microbial life is wildly different from what were accustomed to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's an alien world not separated by distance but by scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our game was made with the intention of putting the user in the role of a microbe whose objective is simply to reproduce.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game takes place in a Petri dish so we used a 2D game engine called unity to code the game.
All the sprites were designed during the course of  Hacking EDU and no outside assets were used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only one person on our team had experience with Unity so it was a bit of a learning curve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, 36 hours is a very long time when you're conscious for all of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I feel like we all progressed a lot in our code and knowledge of 2D game development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope to take what we learned in this Hackathon and apply it to other Unity applications including Virtual Reality and android development.
