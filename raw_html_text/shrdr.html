                    Inspiration:
    We wanted a safer way to dispose of documents that could pose a privacy risk
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does:
    It encrypts a file of your choosing into a form that can never be recovered
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it:
   Shrdr generates a completely random 128-bit key and then encrypts your file using military grade encryption algorithms. The key is then deleted, rendering the contents of the file inaccessible. For added security, users may choose to also shrd their encryption key, in order to protect against advanced adversaries who are able to view the contents of memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into:
   Finding the best way to destroy the data was our biggest challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
  Building a project in the time allotted that worked
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned:
    Practical cryptography, and some of us got better at Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for Shrdr:
   Integration with cloud file sharing platforms
                </p>
