                </h2>
                <p>
                    Machine Learning for Medicine - Pneumonia nowadays is still a life-threatening disease that may affect young children's lives. To exam the illness, an X-ray scan is usually taken and the infected area may be detected by doctors. The project aims to develop a program that assists doctors to determine the situation.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Image Classification - X-ray images are processed and input into the program and an output stating whether there is a case of pneumonia will show.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CNN models - use CNN models to process image data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Training&amp;data processing - The training process and data processing are very difficult to handle. Each image is of a different size. To resize the images without compromise the result, it requires a series of attempts of different parameters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We achieved over 90% accuracy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Image processing is not as simple as it seemed.

                    To include more data in the dataset and have more features, including boxed boundaries for infected areas.
