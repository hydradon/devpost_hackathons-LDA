                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Miami, FL, a large portion of high schools do not have advisors, counselors, or cap advisors to assist in guiding Juniors and Seniors into getting into high school. Websites like College Board don't offer simple explanations to students or parents who are looking to get into college. Apollo has the potential to do great. In the touch of a button, students have a tailored college search experience like no other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Apollo, students are able to input the specifics of their schooling and we find schools that fit their need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apollo was built with Swift.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges Apollo ran into were regarding UI. The constant design changes and need to update the style lead us to be behind a few times. Eventually we got the work down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finally finishing the UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to properly intertwine GitHub and Xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Apollo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on bringing Apollo to the hands of students by 2019. This is something we want to take off considering how many children of immigrants don't go to college in Miami due to the language barrier or simple misinterpretation.
