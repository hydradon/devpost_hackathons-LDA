                    Idea and Goals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create delve into the world of ML while also creating something enjoyable for the end user.

                <p>
                    This is a game where the player creates levels for the character to train on and then tests them on a "Campaign" mode.

                    Story

                <p>
                    Opportunity is stranded on Mars! Please come home Opportunity...
                </p>
                <p>
                    But we can't contact her and guide her to the end. So Opportunity must train herself...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Design levels to help her find her way back to an outpost! Remember you cannot directly control her, but only design
training courses to help her further her progress...
