                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people want to donate but don't know exactly where to donate with respect to causes they are passionate about.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project helps the users find charitable organizations by showing different causes they feel passionately about or are currently trending in the world, as well as the added unique feature of allowing users to tap on a location they  want to donate to, anywhere in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google and Twitter APIs to feature an interactive map in the interface; there is an embedded twitter feed of our project's twitter page, which is automatically updated with the latest tweets about giving. he map allows you to click on location markers all over the globe and directs you to the respective charity's page, while the . Have used basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to look for tons of data to be used in our project and sorting out the charitable organizations based on their location and mission. It took us a while to figure out how to use the payment feature for the donations on our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud to create a bot twitter account that retweets automatically every 10 minutes with tweets having keywords such as 'charity', 'wildfires', 'endangered species', etc. Having the constraint of 36 hours and minimal coding experience, we were still able to bring our idea into fruition.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use different APIs to develop various functions for the website. It was also interesting to play around with different templates of HTML and use features within CSS to make the website's design creative.
                </p>

                    What's next for HopIn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to include a lot of different features on HopIn such as creating friends and family feed, where people can see and share with others where and how much they have donated to act as a source of encouragement for people. A 'recommended' feature will be placed within the website which will provide users with recommendations of different charitable organizations based on the causes they are interested in and their previous donations. HopIn plans to be a platform which serves the community in multiple ways.
