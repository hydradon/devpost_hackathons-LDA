                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For fun, we wanted to make a simple dice program. However, after we completed that, we decided to make the program more complicated.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program is originally supposed to simulate a die, fair or unfair; however, this program can be used to simulate any real-life situation, as the amount of outcomes can be changed into any positive integer.
