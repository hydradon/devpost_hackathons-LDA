                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main goal was to experiment with hardware, which we were both unfamiliar with, and build a game with it. We wanted to create a fun game that could bring people together and build trust at the same time. Play stimulates creativity and happiness, and can deepen relationships.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Blind Assassins is based on the classic game, Assassins, with a twist: players are blindfolded and can only navigate by holding two controllers whose vibrations are controlled by their teammate. Players have to rely on their other senses while trusting that their partners are leading them in the right direction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Particle Electron and two servo motors. As the controller enters a direction (left, right, or forward) the motors turn on and produce vibrations according to notify the player when to turn or keep going straight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unfamiliar with the Electron and had the most difficulty getting it set up. As a team of two, after spending time figuring out the Particle kit, we had very little time remaining to build the phone app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting motors to work. Troubleshooting all of the bugs that came up along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to connect to and use the Electron to control motors. We also learned how to use Twilio... which we then didn't use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blind Assassins!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building out the phone app and including the functionality that allows for the phone to be the guiding device rather than having to rely on the serial monitor. One potential future application of the navigation functionality we used to develop the game would be a wearable technology that enable hands-free directions for the visually impaired.
