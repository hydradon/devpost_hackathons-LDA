                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the rich history of Atlanta.  Often, it can be overlooked and tourists and residents alike may be unaware of the history in this City.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website gives a recommended tour of historical markers to users around Atlanta based on time available and location.  In addition, passengers from Hartsfield-Jackson with time to spare can get a tour of historical sites across the city.  Their tour is only limited by the time until their next flight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this site using the MEAN stack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The obstacle that hindered us the most was the algorithm for determining the recommended route.  It took us several hours to create a solid algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The algorithm that we created is able to create a top-notch recommended route based on time and location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Escapade
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Escapade has a long of room to grow.  We could add more cities and add more areas of interest.  In addition, we could refine our algorithm and implement machine learning to further improve it.
