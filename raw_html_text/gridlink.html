                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an internal communication application for companies and firms with features such as administrative privileges to monitor, track and edit all of the data through the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using Java and xml, on Android Studio on the Mac OS. A simple graphical user interface running with Parse and Sinch running to provide the backend services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having to switch between a large variety of plans for a hack wasted a lot of time, leaving less time and added pressure for timely completion of the application.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being the entire group's first hackathon, the amount of success achieved in such a short amount of time and with a low level of experience was surely a commendable accomplishment for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better use and knowledge of Java, a very good exposure to setting up backend services.
