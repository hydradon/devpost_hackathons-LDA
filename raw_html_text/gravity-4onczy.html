                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To immerse the player in an alternate reality where they must utilize more than just their brains to solve a series of dynamic puzzles and discover the secret of the world around them.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the tutorial provided, the player uses their grav-gun to manipulate a blue ball to the targeted green zone.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tutorial level uploaded was created using Unity 5 with Oculus integration. The scripts regulating object behavior were done in C#. The terrain and mock-ups of objects for future game expansion were done in 3DS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose a minimalist tutorial structure mainly due to the challenges of creating holistic game design assets in 3DS max and integrating them in Oculus in a way calculated to minimize simulation sickness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sideways thinking that went into the level design for the tutorial that requires the player to stop thinking in terms of more traditional game environments. Also the terrain design and the outside element design which, while not provided in the tutorial,  provides the foundation for expanding our game.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to program in Unity and create 3D models in 3DSMAX
