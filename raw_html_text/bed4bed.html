                    In the time of mobile applications people can benefit from possibility of direct communication and management of things with minimal third party participation. Travelling and accomodation can be an ideal space for connecting people and offer them all the advantages of direct mutual sharing. Inspired by Tinder, we have developed a platform which matches searches and offers of travellers' destinations. In other words, a home of one will become a vacation house of the other and vice versa. And that all based on mutual agreement and payment free. The app provides information and recommendation on location, rates users and their property.
