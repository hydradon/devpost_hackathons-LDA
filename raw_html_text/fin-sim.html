                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a financial simulation of life so young adults would be introduced to some important financial decisions that they will have to face in their future life.

                <p>
                    Our simulation features a person walking through a screen going through life. This is the person making the decision and as time progress they will have to

                    We built it using java.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a big challenge which was time. We had a lot of great ideas and weren't able to execute of all them because of the short amount of time. However, we did the best of our ability and managed to get a lot of the algorithm and analysis down.

                <p>
                    We were proud of having a really good idea and the fact that we were able to make a decent simulation.
