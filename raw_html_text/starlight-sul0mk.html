                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a one on one chat app that people can sign into using their Google accounts. The app allows people to create a password with their email address and speak to others, no matter where they are in the world. Each person selects their language of choice, and they can send messages to the other person in that language. The other person, however, receives the message in THEIR language of choice, making communication across countries much easier!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML/CSS/Javascript for the front-end (website), and Java and Firebase for the messaging and real-time database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the Translate API was the hardest and most time-consuming part of the project. We spent a whole 5 hours getting it to translate without messing stuff up. We eventually overcame them by changing a few libraries and working around the problem. We also had the problem of acquiring an android phone, which none of us had. One friend was able to lend theirs to us. Thanks!

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that it can translate perfectly, and send messages in real time.

                    What we learned
