                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning about encryption was what first got me into programming. I went to a workshop about HTML, and thought it would be cool to test an encryption method on a website. I implemented the algorithm in JavaScript to work with the website. I initially thought about simulating a more complex encryption method, but soon realized that trying to translate the code from C++ to JavaScript would be time-consuming, and went with a simple algorithm to make sure the project was finished on time.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes an input of a shift and message. It shifts each character of the string by the shift to output the ciphertext (or plaintext) for the length of the message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I initially wrote the code in C++, since that's the language I'm most proficient in, but then realized that it had to be written in JavaScript for it to be on the website.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time programming in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS so learning a lot of new syntax and features of these languages was challenging under the time crunch.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of going to my first hackathon and having code that does what it was supposed to do.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt about variables and strings in JavaScript, and how to use different tags in HTML.

                    Simulating a Vigen&egrave;re Cipher or an ADFGVX encryption, once I learn how to use arrays in JavaScript.
