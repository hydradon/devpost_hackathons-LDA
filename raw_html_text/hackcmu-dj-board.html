                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had an arduino board and components and wanted to do something interesting with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes audio and allows the user to modify it with pitch, volume, speed, and subwoofer
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the parts that come with the Arduino starter kit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The speaker has trouble with multiple octaves, so pitching was difficult. We originally planned to allow pitch-changing using a photosensitive component that the user would interact with by moving their hand closer to and farther from the device, but the component wouldn't work with us and we were forced to ditch the feature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the project to some semblance of working, and seeing that this is all of our first hackathon, that's an accomplishment in itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First off, feature creep is deadly. Towards the end we had to get some of the features that were easy by themselves working with the other features on the board, and that proved far more difficult than the sum of the parts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackCMU DJ Board
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The HackCMU DJ board is more a proof of concept than anything else. We'd really like to continue this into a full proper MIDI system with more features like photosensitivity, tilt-sensing, and more.
