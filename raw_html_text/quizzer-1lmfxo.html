                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    my inspiration is the quizlet.com website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the program loads a list of multiple choice and true/false question from a file and then randomizes them and quizzes you while keeping track of right answers to give you a total score when finish
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it was built purely with python using VS Code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the input files is in json format and getting it read properly into the program so I could randomize the questions AND randomize the multiple choice answers was the most challenging part. also, several of the questions involve a gif that is checked for and display with the question
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I was able to get it all done and that it works exactly like I envisioned it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to work with json files, graphics files and how to display items in random order with out repeating and making sure every question gets asked.
                </p>

                    What's next for Quizzer
                </h2>
                <p>
