                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having applied to numerous hackathons, we've always found the process repetitive and redundant. We knew there had to be a better option, so what better place to come with one than at a hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CommonHack brings together all of the functionality of a hackathon registration system while saving potential hackers from answering the same "tell us about a project you've worked on" questions over and over. CommonHack is similar to the CommonApp, a college application system that allows students to answer the questions which are common to all colleges (name, achievements, extracurriculars, etc.) just once, while still allowing colleges the flexibility to ask specific questions related to their institution.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Wix Code to build the front-end user interface. All user profile data and hackathon information is stored in a Firebase back-end, and is retrieved by our front-end using a REST API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, it was difficult to integrate Wix Code with a foreign database. We used Wix Code to perform what amounted to an inner-join between a database stored locally on Wix with enough information to set up the basic user interface and a database stored on Firebase with the application data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the fact that we were able to rapidly prototype and create a functional and relatively well-designed front-end and back-end for a project that would normally take a team several weeks to write.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that developing a proof-of-concept, as mentioned by Scott Forstall during opening ceremony, requires a different way of thinking than developing a fully-featured version of an app.
