                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> An operation game is a silly skill game, Operation game is a battery-operated game of physical skill that tests players' hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. Originally made by Milton Bradley, and currently made by Hasbro,[1] it has been in production since 1965, the year in which the game was invented by John Spinello.

                    The game is a variant on the old-fashioned electrified wire loop game popular at funfairs and flammer stores around the United States. It consists of an "operating table", lithographed with a comic likeness of a patient (nicknamed "Cavity Sam") with a large red lightbulb for his nose. In the surface are a number of openings, which reveal cavities filled with fictional and humorously named ailments made of plastic. The general gameplay requires players to remove these plastic ailments with a pair of tweezers without touching the edge of the cavity opening.

                    HOW DOES THE OPERATION GAME WORKS?
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Basically, the game works by creating a simple circuit. The battery, light, buzzer, metal edges on the body and metal tweezers are connected by wires yet the wires do not go in a full circle. ie. imagine that each part is like on a chain yet it wont work unless the chain is done up and goes in a full circle. This is called a complete circuit. To complete the circuit the metal of the tweezers must touch the metal edge of the body. This connection works the same as a switch would in a simple circuit such as turning on a light. When the circuit is complete the light and buzzer turn on from the power in the battery. However, if the circuit is not complete this can't happen.
