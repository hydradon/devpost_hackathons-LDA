                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted something that was more visually clear about deadlines that are approaching. Google calendar is a great tool, but it doesn't always make it super obvious what are the important deadlines approaching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get information from your Google calendar and displays it on a strip of LEDs. As the deadlines get closer and closer, the color used to display the event gets more aggressive and starts blinking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an arduino and Node.js. Node drives the arduino instead of compiling c++ to run on it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything was a challenge. I originally wanted to use Python on a raspberry pi, but I realized learning a completely new language would probably be out of the scope of this hackathon when combined with all the other details I had to figure out. I also originally wanted to use a DragonBoard, but found that there was little to no documentation for it online. While using a raspberry pi, I began to recognize the disadvantages of such a small computer, as it started overheating just from installing the packages I would need to even begin making the program. When I finally pivoted to an arduino, I had trouble following along to get it to communicate with Node. I also struggled to decipher the calendar API, then to get all of the three different technologies (LED strip, calendar, and Node) to communicate with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I figured out how to drive an arduino with code directly off my computer, I got back into JavaScript and Node.JS, which I haven't used since high school, learned the basics of editing files in Vim, and I finally figured out how to get some usable information from the calendar API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    See above
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PROJECT: CASCADE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First step moving forward: debugging. From then on, I want to continually add functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The endgame would be driving this from a raspberry pi instead of my laptop. I would also like to implement options to see the calendar from different scopes (everything within the next week, two weeks, due today, etc.), and I want to add messages in Morse code of encouragement and urgency to the events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be optimal to also implement other uses for the array of LEDs that this uses, I.E. also having a mode for mood lighting or to replace a wake up alarm with something that might be less intense.
