                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simon Says is a memory game. Start the game by pressing one of the four buttons. When a button lights up, 
 press the button, repeating the sequence. The sequence will get longer and longer. The game is won after 
 5 rounds.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took help from the arduino website , a lot of youtube videos and other friends
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the Simon says circuit and the LCD display circuit together, we had to thinkand think and think and manipulate the code and we finally realized that we would need more hardware components in order to complete the think , so would be the firstthink we would do once we have got them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both the source codes work perfectly, and the sound, the leds and the fact that it&acute;s actually a lot of fun to play the game, we actually took hours to win all the rounds!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about arduino and the SparkFun Inventor&acute;s Kit
