                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recognizing names, but having no idea where you would know that person from and finding out what your peers in fb groups are doing.

                <p>
                    The chrome extension authenticates your fb account. Then, it parses through any webpage and highlights the names of people that are in at least one mutual fb group. The list of persons is transferred to the chrome extension and reveals the profile picture with the name to the right of it.
