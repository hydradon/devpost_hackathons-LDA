                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amazon doesn't have a random item feature so I thought I'd make my own
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses Wordnik API to locate a random word from the dictionary and then searches it in the Amazon store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have never used an api before or made a chrome extension. Sending and receiving information from Wordnik was extremely difficult. Many solutions were simply impossible because of chrome extension policies.

                <p>
                    Adding prize ranges and pruning the word list. Some of the words have no results on Amazon.
