                    The market maker will often set a spread, for example &pound;4-&pound;5, for a product, say a pencil. This means they will buy in at &pound;4/pencil and sell at &pound;5/pencil. The challenge part is to predict the actual value of the pencil so that you can set such a spread. Thus, we made this game in order to simulate that process for anyone who wants to know more about market making and trading in general.

                    How to play
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are 4 players and 15 cards, numbered from 1 to 15. 7 cards are drawn from random. The sum of the 7 cards is the
                    <code>
                        market value
                    </code>
                    of the product we are making the market for. The other 8 cards will be discarded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the start of the game, each of the players will receive a card. Each player only knows their own card. There are 4 rounds. After each of the first 3 rounds, one of the remaining 3 cards is revealed to all the players. Each of the players will take turn to make the market for the product (with a spread of 1). The other players will then have to buy/sell between 1-3 products. For example, if Player 1 is making a market of 54-55, other players can buy 1-3 products at 55, or sell 1-3 products at 54.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Market Making 101 runs on the terminal. We built it using Java as the main programming language, with

                        Keanu
                    </a>
                    to help us represent various probabilistic variables within the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first time we encountered with Probabilistic Programming Language. The API is also currently in active development. Thus, we spent quite a bit of time figuring out how to use many features of the language.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite spending the first 3 hours struggling to find ideas, we completed the game both in the backend and the UI. Overall, the game is rather polished (e.g. decent visualisation despite Java and is decently challenging for the beginner).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hope Market Making 101 is an interesting introduction that potentially inspires many traders-to-be out there.

                    as a probabilistic programming language and how to incorporate it into our project.

                    What's next for Market Making 101
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are making the game more difficult by allowing a larger range of values, hence increase the uncertainty of the true value. The spread could also be varied depending on how confident the market maker is of the true value. Lastly, we hope we have time for a more eye-catching UI than the pretty-printing in the terminal.
