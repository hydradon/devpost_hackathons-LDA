                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are always asking ourself what to buy when we are at the store. Do we have a butter at home or not?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracking groceries that are at our fridge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web camera connected to Raspberry Pi recognizes bar codes of the groceries that we put in or out of the fridge. With an Android app we can also monitor what we have when we are at the store and on the way home we can also register new groceries with it as well. Data is stored at Azure service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding libraries which recognizes bar codes and how to connect multi operating software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Good team is important. This team is amazing!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work in a team and how to work with a Grove's hardware.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Smart Fridge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of recognizing bar codes we want to recognize the shapes of groceries or with a help of speech recognition. Connecting Smart Fridge with AmazonFresh. Shopping takes to much time and we need to reduce it!
