                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were initially stuck on what idea to choose, until something miraculous happened; it first began with a fellow hacker asking:
                    <em>
                        "Hey, do you know where the washroom is?"
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then, light was revealed to our team of four.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially, a Yelp for washrooms. Users can find the nearest washrooms and rate them in order to
                    <strong>
                        foster human connection
                    </strong>
                    and help make society a better place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed a web app using React.JS for the frontend and Node.JS for the backend. In addition, a SQL server hosted on Microsoft Azure allows us to store washroom location data on the cloud, which users can access from their devices wherever they are. Finally we communicated with Google Maps API to show a map with markers wherever washrooms are located and the user&rsquo;s current location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were a team of first-time hackers, and to be honest, we knew
                    <strong>
                        nothing
                    </strong>
                    . Thankfully with the help of our dear mentors and newly-made friends we were able to complete a hack in less than 24 hours after coming up with the idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are
                    <em>
                        extremely
                    </em>
                    proud of our working demo and the beautiful user interface which is very easy for users to interact with, especially for those who need to find a washroom in a hurry!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of fun building and implementing Need2Go, and we realized that hackathons are fun, even if initially we didn&rsquo;t know anything. Needless to say, coding is difficult - especially for first-timers - however with the
                    <strong>
                        power of friendship
                    </strong>
                    we can overcome anything that we face together!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Need2Go
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What&rsquo;s next? Currently ideas are in plan for expanding the serviceable area for available washrooms and implementing the ability for user submissions regarding self-marked, secret washrooms. Additionally, adding an option for locating water fountains will also encourage users to bring their own reusable water bottles in order to help save our planet and bringing humans closer together in sustainability.
