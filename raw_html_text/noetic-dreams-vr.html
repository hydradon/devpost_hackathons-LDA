                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to a recent study, people suffering of certain brain tumors are unable to dream anymore. 
However, the average person has about 1,460 dreams a year. Most people over the age of 10 dream at least 4 to 6 times per night during a stage of sleep, although we tend to forget 95 to 99 percent of our dreams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This inspired us to create a playground that allows each of us to borrow and customize immersive dreams adapted in virtual reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each user will be able to explore and customize its own DreamNA from a database of adapted dreams in VR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to a study by Amerisleep, the most common things American dream about are: falling (53%), being chased (50%), being back in school (37%), being unprepared for a test or for an important event (34%), flying (32%). The survey was done on over 2,000 people scattered throughout the U.S. Some researchers have found a correlation between the job of each person and the dream content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, the questions are endless as this is still a highly under-researched topic.
Why do we dream? What is the meaning of our dreams? Do we have recurring dreams?
With this project, we address questions rather than answers and to design a playful manner of accessing VR dream adaptations. 
On the long-term, we aim to create an arts-based research platform to explore collective dreaming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DreamNA is a virtual playground that matches users with customized virtual reality dream adaptations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created an interactive website, that structures the user&rsquo;s journey in three main chapters:
Introduction: the viewer is introduced to the concept and the journey
Questionnaire: the user answers five key-questions regarding his personality 
Dream matcher: Based on the answers of the user, the platform will provide a customized virtual reality dream. The VR video will be pulled out of a database of adapted dreams (based on advanced research statistics).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The VR dream may get different contents and different styles, depending on the answers of the user. 
For example, if the user feels sad, DreamNA will provide a VR dream that may cheer him up. 
If the user chooses a realistic dream, the platform will match him/her with a cinematic VR content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the moment we focussed on one user journey's prototype, aiming to perfect it as the users and database will grow.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used FFmpeg to decompose the cinematic VR video into frames, and then we used Cloudinary with Express to host and manipulate video and frames to create a unique dream experience. (ongoing development)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would have been nice to have the ability to manipulate video, instead of frames. The tools we used didn't support style transfer for videos, so we had to find a workaround by decomposing the video programmatically to apply the transform to each frame.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The visual effects we are interest in doing such as liquifying are not available. Maybe they can become available in a future release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We spent time on shrinking the video in order to be able to load it into the tool, due to the file size.
                </p>

                        content-wise, we aim to add an archive of room-scale fictional dreams in virtual reality, that would be much easier to customize. The content will be adapted after collected dream narratives.

                        we aim to expand this concept intro a compelling transmedia journey and social experiment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the platform will integrate and interpret more data of dreamers (having geo-location features etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        creating the multi-player version of the project will allow us to merge customized collective dreams.
