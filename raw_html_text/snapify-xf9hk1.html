                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to easily share music that I listen to on Spotify with my friends through Snapchat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app has a built-in Spotify music player that provides playback options for the current music you are playing and if you tap on the Snapchat logo you are transferred to a Snap preview with an album cover sticker as well as a capture text of the song's title and artist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the app on Android Studio and went through the Snap Kit Docs and the Spotify Android SDK Docs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to convert a bitmap resource and save it as an internal file in order to share it as a sticker on Snapchat which proved to be more difficult than I expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the Spotify music player since it fluently handles most of the functionality of a Spotify app and the album cover sticker that is automatically included in your Snap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the Snap Creative Kit as well as the Spotify Android SDK.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snapify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to add more playback option for Spotify player as well as an option to browse through your library. Also, I would like to add other Snap options like choosing pictures and videos from your phone storage.
