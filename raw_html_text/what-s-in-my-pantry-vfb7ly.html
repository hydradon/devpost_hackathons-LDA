                <p>
                    As a 25 year old dude living with other 25 old dudes, grocery shopping is sporadic. This habit has often left me wondering "Hmmmm ... What could I make with just the items in my pantry?".

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You tell it what's in your pantry and it magically takes you to a lip-smacking recipe. It truly does!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NodeJS, Bootstrap and healthy amounts of glue, spit and twine.

                    Probably a convenient shopping assistant that can help you order more stuff for the next cooking adventure.
