                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on the popular TV show Rick and Morty, we decided to create a virtual assistant adapting one of the characters, Snowball (AKA snuffles).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snowball accepts commands by voice communication. Most of the stock commands are designed to help you with everyday task such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Defining words
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        informs you of global news
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Searches
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Jokes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        and more
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used IBM-Watson to create a conversational environment using Text to speech and  Speech to text APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the Unity3d Engine we created the UI with different animations and sprites from Rick and Morty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used other APIs to for different commands such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Yahoo news
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wordnik
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Icndb
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Out biggest challenge was making sure a commands wasn't being executed multiple times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are super hyped on how fluent and easy the app is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snowball
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add more stock commands and hope to get the code to other developers to see what cool stuff they could create.
