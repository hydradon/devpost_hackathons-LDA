                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millions of homes are not secure. Modern day surveillance systems cannot effectively identify potential threats, resulting in thousands of monthly break ins around the world. In addition, motion sensor technology is becoming outdated, and the world of security is leaning towards AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BlinkLens utilizes artificial intelligence to detect faces and alert people when there is an intruder in their residence or office space.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this platform on the raspberry pi and developed the project in python, the most efficient and powerful data science language in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges while setting up the pi and installing the necessary packages with low bandwidth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of making the platform fully functional and creating an outstanding prototype
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a great deal about open CV and machine learning algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blink
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The future of Blink is visioned to have Amazon Alexa to act as validation for the intruder using voice recognition and a password flow that interacts with the Pi.
