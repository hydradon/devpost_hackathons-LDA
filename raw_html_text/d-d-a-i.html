                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neil and I have been playing a bunch of D&amp;D recently, and I've been really interested in A.I. and more intelligent software systems in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Makes moderately intelligent decisions for all the characters in the game, weighing multiple tactical options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used c# and Unity, and also a mix of Visual Studio and Mono Develop as our IDEs. For source code control, we made use of Unity's Collaboration feature. We started out by designing the entire system abstractly, and implementing features using a priority system that allowed us to more easily finish with at least baseline functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Unity debugger wouldn't show list contents. I also didn't realize how far behind Unity's version of c# is, so some basic collections and functionality that I was expecting to have was absent, for example, we couldn't use System.Collections' newer Tuple functionality! We also had a small team, and really had to push, and neither of us really slept at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Quickly designing and implementing a functioning AI system in such a short period.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A ton about c# and Visual Studio. More about goals-based AI systems, how to debug Unity.
                </p>
