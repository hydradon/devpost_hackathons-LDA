                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are thousands public and private universities in Indonesia, yet Indonesia is still on the lower ranks of the world Educational Index, we find it so ironic.
Based on our experience, one of the causes is the students personal problem while they are studying in the classroom.
Our research focus is to create something that may help students to learn something in a new way. We choose an Information Technology as our spesific topic. Because in Indonesia alone, there are so many programming community with also large community members.
What we want to do is to create an effective sharing session in the community using mobile devices and internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Buhan-bot is a Facebook Messenger App which act like a personal assistant to help you follow the sharing session in your community effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did a little bit exploration on how to use Facebook Messenger Platform, and then we can figure it out what to do next and what to built with it. We discussed about the features we were about to build with Facebook Messenger Platform, and then finally we agreed to make the features such as Virtual Class, Ask the Lecturer, and Encyclopedia. We build the project with the microservice system, Burhanbot system contains one Webhook and three Webservices. The Webhook plays role as connector between Facebook and Webservice. Meanwhile The Webservices are responsible for each feature in Burhanbot and to communicate with Database and Third Party Apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been looking for the better solution to solve the educational problem in our country, and
we believe that someday no matter what the problem is, through the technology we can solve any
problem to simplify the life and make the world a better place to be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are a team of four, by using Facebok Messenger API we made something that hopefully public
can accept and use it for daily basis. Other that we won the Bandung Developer Circles Hackaton as
a Runner Up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are actually a lot of services available that we can use for our product and make something
useful with it. Also working in team, teach us how to do a great and effective communication among
us.
