                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend of mine who invited me to attend the Hackathon together showed me this tool for the first time. I thought it looked easy for a beginner to learn. So, I tried it too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does is nothing. The purpose of this was to familiarize myself with the software that I used.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it is using Figma. I am still not familiar with using the tools.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into were figuring out each tool's function and how it helps in designing.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of is getting to know that there are resources like Figma available online for free that I can surely experiment on.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned is that knowing how to design is different from knowing how to design a web. I also learned that there are so many things that I want to try but don&rsquo;t know how to.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My First Figma is familiarizing myself further using Figma and probably explore other free softwares as well. I want to expand my knowledge across multiple disciplines, not just the one that I am studying at university.
