No program can play fruitful role for the development of the people by keeping the ordinary people out of the development process. Bangladesh government had already made principles and taken programs, and implemented the programs to reduce poverty, hunger, inequity, depriveness, unemployment and illiteracy and poverty elimination. But no program can play effective role for entire development. For this reason, there is a need of increasing public participation in development process and capacity building for the grass-root level people. in order to reach this goal, VDC is implementing campaign programs at national and grassroots level. VDC, as a coordinator of RangpurDistict committee organization, is implementing the program &ndash; &ldquo;Promoting Pro-Poor Policy Reforms and Public Services for All (2010-2012)&rdquo;.
