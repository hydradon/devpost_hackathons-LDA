                <p>
                    As a patent attorney and developer, I was especially interested in learning how smart contracts would reshape the world of business and the role of attorneys as middle men, and my team of developers were interested in exploring opportunities with decentralized apps.  The disintermediation made possible by the blockchain is also threatening to unseat participants in another popular industry: gambling.  In an effort to both learn the Solidity language and explore how smart contracts can be used to facilitate simple betting operations, we worked to adapt the project posted by Merunas Grincalaitis at

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we had some experience in JavaScript and recent practice in Solidity, our main challenge was figuring out how to use React to connect our smart contract, which deployed successfully in the Remix IDE, with the front-end environment.  As a result, we weren't able to fully implement our Dapp by the dapphack submission deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're thrilled that we got our smart contract to deploy successfully, and that we understand Solidity well enough to change the focus and purpose of the sample code to handle more complicated betting functions.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that Solidity is a powerful tool, and that React can make front-end development more straightforward, with practice.
