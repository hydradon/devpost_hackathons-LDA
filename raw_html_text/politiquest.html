                    The game is a trivia showdown between two players to see who can get to 270 points first.
Points are counted by actual electoral college values!
All questions related to the state you are in one way or another.
Each round is a "debate" (which is actually a trivia question) and if you guess wrong your opponent gets a chance to answer.  You keep answering until you get a question wrong.  So you have a chance to rattle off a few states in a row to score big-time points!  May the best "politician" win!
