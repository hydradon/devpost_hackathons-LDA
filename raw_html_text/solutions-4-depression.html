                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Depression affects over 264 million people globally according to a 2019 article on depression by the World Health Organization. Depression often can lead to suicide, which is the second leading cause of death in young people today. We wish to help raise people's self-awareness on whether or not their depressed and how severe their depression may be. We also aim to give them some more information and solutions to whatever severity they have.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website asks a series of questions and uses the data collected from the answers to give the user one of three results: no depression, moderate depression, and sever depression. We give them their result with some characteristics of their type and help give them a solution.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we used HTML and CSS as the front-end language and JavaScript as the back-end language. HTML and CSS allowed us to format the texts and make the buttons. JavaScript allowed us to change the questions and function the buttons. Also, photoshop is used to make the background.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to use Django to make the website at first but it didn't go well so we changed to the Javascript. It was a bit late to change the whole frame so it took a lot of time from us. Moreover, Most of us had no experience with JavaScript and did not touch on HTML and CSS for a long time. That led to us having to spend a lot of time to work on simple functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to build a working website for the first time in a language that most of us didn't know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate JavaScript with CSS and HTML. We also learned about how serious depression really is through the research that we had to do for this project.

                <p>
                    We plan on implementing a more personalized experience into our website. We will add more subquestions that ask about specific hobbies and questions and give helpful and specific solutions. For example, if someones says that they are losing interest or motivation to participate in their favourite sport, soccer, we will connect them to soccer games, clubs, or related activities in their area! We also plan on telling them what specific type of depression they may have and we will connect them to doctors or specialist in their area who can best help them. We also want to make a premium version that will offer an even more personalized experience by offering more options and one-on-one counselling. We could partner with universities to offer free premium services to students as there often is a high rate of depression and suicide among university students. If possible, we would like to expand this into a platform that deals with more than just depression and also includes other mental health problems.
