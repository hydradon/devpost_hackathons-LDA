                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create a device that would help deaf people communicate in real-time with others.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It transcribes and labels speakers in conversations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We integrated a python backend with Rev-AI, flask, and HTML/CSS/JS. The python backend continually listens to the conversation and performs speech-to-text conversion and detects the speaker, while the frontend listens for data sent by the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to interface the backend and frontend, and also to work with the Rev-AI API, as the python version used generators, and so it was hard to interface the library with other parts of our code.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to fit all the pieces together and create a working MVP.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of new things, i.e. sockets.

                    What's next for Readdit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to improve the voice recognition aspect, as well as add more features to personalize the product and improve the UI.
