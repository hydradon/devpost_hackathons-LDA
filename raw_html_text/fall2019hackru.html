                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to do something that brought greater awareness to climate change. We wanted to create an application that brings information from different sources across the internet together into a single unified experience that greatly simplified and clarified the data available
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now it only pulls information from NASA in the form of an image and a list of research papers related to climate change and renders the list in a more readable format than the website it is hosted on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed the application in ReactJS. We used the axiom API to make API calls to the same backend that the NASA website pulls from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble finding open weather APIs that were available and free to use that offered what we needed. We did not plan out which APIs that we were going to use at first so a lot of time was spent crawling the web and inspecting elements on different climate data gathering sites to figure out where the API data was being pulled from and trying those APIs with Postman to see which ones actually gave a response.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we found an API directly from NASA's website that loaded the news articles and were able to get them to render directly to our application. We are also proud of the fact that we were able to learn so much about React and actually successfully make an API call with little previous experience for 3/4 of our group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton about React and how it had changed since classes and state, and how to use React hooks as a better way to make API calls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Climate Awareness App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to find more APIs and add it to our application and a backend to track weather averages over time. We also hope to implement some kind of data algorithm that can analyze and predict data trends.
