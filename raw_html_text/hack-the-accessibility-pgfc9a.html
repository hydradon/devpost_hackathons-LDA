                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking for inspiration and someone said "do something a CEO can use". We decided to create a fintech app, using CapitalOne and BlackRock APIs to generate the best three options to invest, looking at different ratios and returns (peRatio, pbRatio, returnonEquity, returns from year 1 and year 5). Furthermore, we wanted to make it more useful, so, we had the idea to implement this project for projects with disabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using American Sign Language, you can ask Alexa to do different tasks for you: get your account balance, make payments for you, generate the first three best investment options and interact with Alexa during executing those tasks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Leap-Motion: we created a machine learning program, which "reads" the signs and generate a string, which is sent to Alexa
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        CapitalOne: we used their API to access a set of accounts, in order to make a payments and to generate the balance for the user's account
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alladin: we used their API to access different investment portfolio and through an econometrics model, it returns your best three options for investment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alexa: we integrate everything as an Alexa's skill
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some problems Amazon Web Services and we had to get use with their platform, in order to learn how to program Alexa. Furthermore, AWS Lambda did not work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt node.js! Furthermore, one of our team member was at his first Hackathon and another one is with a non-programming background, so, we are proud of the whole program!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Develop the program, add more financial features and signs.
