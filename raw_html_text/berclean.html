                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to incentivize customers to reduce their carbon emissions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app depicts the market prices and marginal emissions so that customers can not only reduce their costs but also their carbon emissions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are not computer scientists so we did the analysis and mockups of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't know how to code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to simulate marginal carbon emissions and connect that to the cost of carbon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that real-time pricing alone may not reduce carbon emissions.
                </p>

                    What's next for BERClean
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We get someone to program this and implement it in an electricity market.
