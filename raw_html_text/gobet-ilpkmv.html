                <p>
                    My little brother is a HUGE fan of the video game, CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Operations) and one of the things he loves about it is its betting community,

                    , which allows players to bet virtual items on e-sport tournaments. I thought the idea was fantastic and wondered if I could make a similar platform that would allow people to do the same for real life events. That's when the idea for GoBet took off.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GoBet is a social betting application that allows users to set up personalized, one-on-one bets with friends through a networking platform that resembles a mix of Facebook and Instagram. With the GoBet iOS app, users can set up new bets on events instantly and tag their friends to issue a challenge. Once challenges are posted, anyone on their friends list and nearby (if they allow for it) will be able to view and accept the challenge. Once the event is over, the winner is rewarded with the total pot and the result is displayed on the GoBet news feed!
                </p>
                <p>
                    For communities that focus on betting in a particular area, such as Football, Soccer, or Video Games, groups can be formed that enable like-minded users to connect easily and bet more! GoBet groups will also have an in-group merit system that allows top winners to show off their winnings!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Official groups can host large scale bets called Big Events, which will allow users to bet on a popular, well-known events knowing the stakes in advance. Once Big Events are completed, the pot is split between those who bet on the winning side.

                <p>
                    A key feature of GoBet includes the "Explore" functionality, which causes a feed of local bets to appear, one card at a time. Users then can swipe left or right, expressing whether they're interested
