                <p>
                    We are both motivated undergraduate researchers at UCSD that work in computer science and computational neuroscience labs. When we first started, we were overwhelmed with the amount of research that existed in our respective areas. Academia is inundated with old and new papers, and being able to perform novel research relies on knowing what already exists. We built
                    <strong>
                        Treeage
                    </strong>
                    , a combination of Tree and Triage, to provide an easy and visually appealing way to explore the most relevant papers in any field.

                    We programmed
                    <strong>
                        Treeage
                    </strong>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered problems with the original GUI package we were using, which is why we ended up switching to tkinter. The math behind creating the fractal-like patterns of the papers we wanted to display was also an unexpected challenge. Neither of our main programming languages' are python, but we were happy to face that challenge head-on!

                    We are very proud of the progress we were able to make on this project in just 36 hours. While subsisting on mainly coffee and peanut-butter filled cliff bars, we created a tool that we know we would use in our academic lives.

                    will expand the search options to include searches by paper title and key word. We will also improve the graphics, so that when you click on a paper screen will glide to that position instead of jumping.
