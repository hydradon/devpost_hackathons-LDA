                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Existing speech processing tools (like Google Cloud) are mainly focused on Speech-to-Text task, which may help us but still does more work than needed. So, to trigger on a very limited set of words and stems, we decided to move to our own
                        <strong>
                            RNN

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We've made our small word recordings dataset representative and homogeneous enough (in terms of voice qualities, background noises, loudness speed and so on).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li>
                        We've managed to collect our own bootstrapped dataset, generated from ~50 obscene and 'normal' word samples.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        First time dared to participate in data science track on a hackathon.

                    <li>
                        Solved the first audio processing task in our datascience lives :)

                    <li>
                        As no team members had ever worked with audio data, we had to learn a lot from the very basics of speech preprocessing and augmentation.
