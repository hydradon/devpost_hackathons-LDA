                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our team members have a musical background. So, we wanted to integrate our musical and technical background to do something good for the people by building a musical application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So,it teaches people, whoever wants to learn music theory, staff notations corresponding to a piano note.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a technical background in the programming languages like Java, Javascript, Android Studio Development, HTML, CSS, P5.js. So, we utilized these languages, integrated each of our team members' code and built the final application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were not very proficient in android development kit. So, most of us did not have a clear vision on the development process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we did not have a good background in android development, we utilized the knowledge of our programming languages, communicated ideas with each other, learned things on the go and built the application. Within a short span of time, our team is very proud to learn the plethora of things by working together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Application Development, New frameworks like P5.js, some new integration ideas, Teamwork, Communicating Ideas
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Piano Notation Helper
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, at its demo stage, the application only allows you to practice and learn one song. In future development we would like to add more songs with varying difficulties. We would also like to add a stronger user interface as well as allowing the user to eventually create their own staff notation.
