                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teachers in the United States work on a small salary and stringent budget, but nonetheless are required to spend money out of their own pockets to buy classroom supplies and materials to ensure every student gets the best education available and to enhance the learning experience. Parents and children buy new school supplies every single year, and a lot of it is bought in bulk simply because of value deals. At the end of the year, so many supplies are wasted when they could still be put to good, quality use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this web service/app, we are solving two major problems with one efficient solution and, at the same time, bringing the community together to support its schools. Our service allows teachers to request items throughout the school year and people in the community to see those requests and donate if they have unneeded items that teachers do need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Meteor framework to build this web app, implementing Javascript, HTML, and CSS. We also used MongoDB, and our web app is deployed on Galaxy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of the team didn't really know anything about web development or web design, so there was a bit of a learning curve for both of the back-end and front-end development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot and were successful in successfully completing our prototype web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use the Meteor framework, Javascript, CSS/HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TeacherGoods
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We envision adding a location capability to allow people to filter by location (hopefully one day being international) and adding more elements to the user profile to verify teachers and donors. We'll also implement a rating system to prevent fraud donors as well as a security system to prevent spam, fraudulent accounts, and denial of service attacks. Eventually, donor supplies could also be posted and aggregated into a database that helps automatically match up offered supplies to requested supplies with live updates. We hope for future partnerships with retailers that would be able to donate any surplus goods such Walmart, Google, Microsoft, Amazon.
