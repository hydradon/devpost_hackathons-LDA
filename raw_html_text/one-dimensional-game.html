                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twang videos on YouTube.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You control a dot as it ventures through a one-dimensional space. Along the way, you encounter enemies and other obstacles that make the path difficult.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Arduino language and IDE, and built a controller with a joystick and a push button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We couldn't figure out how to get a custom library that we wrote to work, so we had to put all of our code for each function into the same .ino file. We separated the task into sections and found it difficult to combine them all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the hero to move and change colors along with abilities. We also got the enemies and lava to kill the character when encountering them unprepared.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to combine analog and digital components to make a game.

                    What's next for One Dimensional Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More levels, including boss levels, other obstacles and abilities for the hero.
