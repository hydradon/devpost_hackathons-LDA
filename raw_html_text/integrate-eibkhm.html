                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to statistics from 2018, only 31% of people in the United States knew who their neighbors were. This number is very low considering that you live right next to your neighbors and have possibly been living there for a few years. Because so little people in America know who their neighbors are, they can download "Integrate" to help them meet their neighbors.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Users can create events and other users in their neighborhood can choose whether they would like to attend the event at that time or not. This way, neighbors can plan when to meet up with simple tasks such as walking the dog.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we put all the information we needed onto a Google Slide and after all the information was put down, we created a virtual machine in Google Cloud to run Wordpress and transferred the information to there. We also created drawings to show the steps of using Integrate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wordpress was confusing and hard to use at times, we had to think of the domain name, and we had to think of a way to get neighbors to meet up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to figure out how to use Wordpress and Google Cloud to figure out a simple way for neighbors to meet up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to navigate Wordpress and how to be more time efficient by splitting jobs among the 3 of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Integrate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on making it so that people everywhere can connect with each other and not just neighbors. In addition, we could try to make this a real app that people could use to connect with others.
