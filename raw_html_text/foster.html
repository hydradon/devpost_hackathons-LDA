                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Countless times has our group walked down a neighborhood and witnessed empty rent space. Most of us have seen stores go out of business due to lack of attention from the people. We wanted to try at creating a product that would be helpful to the community. With Foster, it ends up being a simple win-win situation for both the consumer and the business.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Foster takes the vote of the people and uses the acquired data to help marketers place a business in a more desired location. This ensures the business gets attention and succeeds while also securing the wants of the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This our first time really working with backend work so it isn't 100% but it works. We used most javascript ,npm packages, and frameworks. Socket.io so two people can interact on the site @ the same time. Node.js was used for most if not all server-side code. We also used React.js alongside with the npm packages. Most importantly we used love and positivity to bring it all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Challenge that was bothering us was the point of working together a process to make the idea &amp; and code come to together. When we thought big it required coding skills way out of our reach &amp; when we thought small we felt bad because we wanted to excel. We found a midpoint and accomplished and learned new technologies
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are indeed proud of the prototype &amp; idea we made. With Foster, it's a win-win situation. We also had so much fun at least messing around with the technologies handed to us
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of backend development and new concepts of advanced javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Foster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If possible &amp; with motivation, we can make a solid web app that communities can use and start our own startup business with Foster. The People we expressed our idea to say they really like it &amp; knows it has potential.
