                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Digging into the iCIMs API, I realized that there was room to utilize the location variable to create an interesting data visualization featuring true zip code data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app gets data from the iCIMs API and then pulls out the location data. I then extract the zip code data out of that, acquiring latitude and longitude numbers. Finally, I use basemap to plot accordingly, with colors representing the status of each application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With Python and a ton of useful libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basemap is surprisingly hard to install. Also, I began the day attempting a hardware hack with Amazon Echo, but then abandoned the project halfway through the night after wrestling with Amazon Lambda. Fortunately, my familiarity and comfort with data science pulled me through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major issue in the dataset was that the location data would not line up at all, having US states in foreign countries, randomized city names, and even non-existent zip codes. My remedy to this issue was to find a nearby working zip code in order to have data on each application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matplotlib is surprisingly powerful. I barely scratched the surface of what it's capable of.
                </p>

                    What's next for Watashi Wa MAP Desu
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A better title hopefully. Also I should try to learn some front end to pretty up the hack.
