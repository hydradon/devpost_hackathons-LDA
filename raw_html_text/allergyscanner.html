                <p>
                    Given an image of a barcode, we have created an app that queries an SQL database for relevant allergen information, displaying it to the user. It also can provide information on Epipen expiry dates, as well as facts and tips for dealing with allergies. We came up with the idea of the AllergyScanner when one of our team members, who has a serious nut allergy, was struggling to read the fine print of the chip bags provided by the HackNYU event. The AllergyScanner will greatly help people living with food allergies avoid a deadly reaction as well as make grocery shopping quicker for anyone dealing with a food allergy either directly or indirectly. The plan would be to work together with companies that are in the food industry in order for them to provide relevant information in order to grow our SQL database of barcodes, subsequently making it safer for users. Using OpenCV and Pyzbar, the application takes a picture of the barcode of interest and converts it into a barcode number which is compared to the database to find the barcode's matching allergen information.

                    Some extensions we wish to make in the future include restaurant information to provide menus with allergen information, emergency text in the case of an allergic reaction which puts you in direct contact with MedicAlert or emergency services, and mobilization to Android and iOS platforms.
