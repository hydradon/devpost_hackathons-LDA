                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a way to reach out to members of the LGBTQ community that cannot yet find support from their families or communities and provide a location for expressing yourself and easily connecting with a supportive peer network. Beyond resource centers, we wanted a platform that would provide validation and a sense of belonging in an easily-accessible, secure and anonymous format. We developed this project with a target audience of those who would not feel comfortable making a public online profile, but still wanted the support of the LGBTQ community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a format to connect with other by experiences and interests, reach out to resources and counselors, and organize events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the basic app using HTML, CSS and a software called Phone Gap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use a language and software that none of us had any experience with, so it was a learning experience. Our design ambitions ended up being much greater than our actual skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of pushing ourselves into something we have never done before. It got challenging but we never gave up and learned a lot. Also, we didn't know what to expect because this is our first hackathon, but we dove in anyways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We persevered and learned more about HTML and how to create an app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Quest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the near future, we hope to complete the app and make it run successfully. We also want to make a website that goes along with the app.
