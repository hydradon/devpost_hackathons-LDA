                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for our app is the prevalence of mental health issues among students and adults. Due to the stigma surrounding mental health, many people who are struggling with their mental health don't seek help. We hope our app could be a means of therapy and a gateway to seeking professional help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an audio journalling app that users could use to record their thoughts or answer questions from our AI bot. The app analyzes the user's mood by detecting certain keywords that correspond with certain moods. After detecting the user's mood, the app provides a Spotify playlist that's most fitting for the user's mood. The user can see a calendar that displays his or her mood for every day he or she received a mood analysis as well as keywords the user frequently used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a website to show the different features of our project that includes multiple designs of the app made from Swift as well as our embedded Google Cloud Platform's DialogFlow chat box.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent over 8 hours trying to figure out how to use Google Cloud Platform features and how to implement them. We're not familiar with APIs so it was very difficult to understand how they were used with Google Cloud Platform features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of coming up with and solidifying the overall idea for our mental health app. We are also proud of learning to work with DialogFlow from scratch in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use and implement Google Cloud Platform features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mood Flow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking to conduct user research in order to expand the range of services provided by the app. We are hoping to gain a better understanding of user needs in terms of mental health. Furthermore, we hope to expand our app to Google Home, to help users incorporate mental therapy and awareness into their daily lives.
