                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Streamers build their own brand, identity, and personas - some even have career defining moments on stream.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built an extension that rewards viewers who were watching live when it happened, and rewards their loyalty with a special emote, badge, and notification banner (upon donation or sub). Viewers with more than one can swap them out too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    New viewers can earn 2nd editions of old badges by watching the clip associated with the memory. For every 2 hours of stream watched, viewers will be able to unlock a badge, emote, item, or avatar accessory.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Viewers are rewarded for one of the most valuable currencies they have - time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Viewers build a stronger relationships with the streamer as they learn more about the streamer's most emotional, pivotal, or craziest moments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Viewers are rewarded to discover past content, and are incentivized to watch additional content in the future.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Streamers have another creative avenue to express personalization and reward loyalty

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it with a React app on a serverless backend on AWS utilizing API Gateway, S3, Lambdas, and DocumentDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Front-end and styling is difficult. Additionally, there are proper ways to build a back-end, but had to balance that with the time constraint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, it's difficult to balance features between what rewards the streamer vs what rewards the viewer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Functionally, it works. Aesthetically, the mockup is great too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Streamers all have different input based on the community they have built. It's amazing how diverse the streaming landscape is.
