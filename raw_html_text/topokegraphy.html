                    Topography
                </h1>
                <p>
                    An educational game about topographic maps using Tanvas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maps are everywhere, but oftentimes they're flat and boring. We tested the Tanvas haptic feedback tablet and saw it as a great opportunity to simulate topographic maps, which are contour maps based on elevation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lower elevations are smoother and have less friction while higher elevations are rougher and have more friction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can drag their finger across the surface of the tablet and feel the contours of the land and pick the correct corresponding realistic photo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio
Tanvas SDK
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Randomizing the answer photos and linking the right answer to the corresponding topography map was a challenge. 
Creating a good layout for the app was also difficult, because the screen size of the tablet was limited.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of learning to use the Tanvas SDK and making a functional app, despite getting a 12-hour late start.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the cool haptic feedback hardware of the Tanvas and how to create friction bitmaps for our app from png images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Topokegraphy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create more difficult topography maps and add more textures. We also would like to add a time, to make the game more challenging. On a bigger scale, we could apply this to Google Earth maps, where we can set a location on Google Earth, provide the right textures for the landscape and have the user pick the matching landmark.
