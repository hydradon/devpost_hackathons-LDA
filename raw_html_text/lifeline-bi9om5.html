                    Inspiration Our inspiration came from Hurricane Erma and Harvey
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does It provides GPS location and a short message about a persons emergency situation with the push of a button
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: We took a push button signal from the push button and treat it as an SOS signal. The arduino then takes information about the device such as location etc. and send this in an email to a select individual via a python code.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Challenges we ran into was insufficient and malfunctioning hardware
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: the accomplishment we are really proud of is the ability to provide accuration location detail without a GPS module.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned: We learned the use of API's and how to be more versatile when it comes to changing ideas.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lifeline: The next step for lifeline would be to incorporate the myo armband and make the hardware significantly smaller and more capable and affordable.
