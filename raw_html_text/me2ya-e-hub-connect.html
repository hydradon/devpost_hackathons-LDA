                    What is the purpose of the me2ya e-Hub Connect?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a mobile app technology built to enhance the User's Entertainment experience by use of creating an e-hub connect library to nine different types of multimedia. Those nine types of multimedia would be music, movies, videos, books, classes, radio, live streams, television, and phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What does the me2ya e-Hub Connect system do?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will connect users with various multimedia platforms for easy retrieval, access, and viewing. It hopes to provide users with a continuously enhanced selection of multimedia resources of entertainment. It is intent on creating a platform for users to select multimedia to upload, download, and log in to; to save, feature, and recall; and to present, share, and entertain individuals, groups, and other select audiences. It inspires a huddle of trend of emerging technology to enable advancement into interactive, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality features.

                    What is the inspiration for this me2ya e-Hub Connect project?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created me2ya e-Hub Connect because we had a need and a real problem with finding a one stop shop for our own multimedia resources. We currently have a multimedia website that links to at least five of the nine multimedia types represented in our project, however, we would love to have a more dynamic and expansive mobile app. We answered this challenge because it enabled us to think about how a mobile app of this type would look, flow, and work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How was me2ya e-Hub Connect built?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept took cues from our multimedia needs, problems, and our current website solution and translated them into production sketch designs. Those sketch designs were developed into design boards with mobile screen shot images and photos that capture the user experience using Photoshop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for me2ya e-Hub Connect?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are looking to build a team for System initiation, User Systems Analysis, Systems Design requirements, and Specifications which will follow this initial concept development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What are other creations by Kube Engineered Solutions?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kube is a database of process and tools which include Smartbiz Fax, 10 Core Assessments, and more. We are also in the beginning stages of a concept for consumer use which will involve personal healthcare and data management. Be sure to stay connected for these current and future developments.
