                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love playing the card game Mao and we wanted to make an online version of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It simulates a round of Mao and allows one player to play with the computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with java. We created the main structure, then added the class Card into the main structure. Then we added the shuffling and drawcard method. Then we added the rules.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't know how to make GUI on java so we had to look it up and learn
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Finishing the project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make GUI and how to make a class and call the class in another class

                    What's next for Mao Card Game Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add more rules to the game and we will make the interface look better and more user-friendly.
