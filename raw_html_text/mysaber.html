                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by our immense love of Star Wars, we wanted to bring the experience of owning your own lightsaber to the world in the convinced of being in your pocket
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can record your own voice or pick from a database of other recorded lightsaber sounds so pose as yours, when you swing your phone with all your Jedi might, it will sound just like the real thing!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python (using flask) for the sound server and Java (using Android Studio) for the UI and functionality of the app
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    Getting the audio data between the server and the app
                </p>
