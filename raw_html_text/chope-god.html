                    MOST SOCIALLY USEFUL HACK
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've wasted a great deal of time walking around NUS looking for a place to study or eat. That's time that could have been spent studying. Or sleeping.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Chope God used Augmented Reality to help you reserve a seat at a meeting room or table, and also view which places are already taken from far away. We use a GPS location to save the pin that you drop and certain places can only be reserved for a certain amount of time to be fair to others. Anyone using the app can view who has reserved the place and for how long more they plan to use it.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this iOS application using the ARKit with a firebase backend. iOS CoreLocation is used to save the location to display the virtual pins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges we ran into. ARKit, being a relatively new framework, is still maturing and was a pain to work with. Saving the location of a pin was also difficult, and so was updating it in real-time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application actually works right now. Anyone who has this app can start using it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To never give up! There were many times that we felt like pivoting but we chose to hang on and work on this because we think this really can make a difference in Singapore, based on our unique culture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Chope God
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to continue developing this application so that we see it being used in NUS and then in the rest of Singapore soon.
