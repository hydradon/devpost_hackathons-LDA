                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've been an avid follower of the demoscene for a while. I wanted to try my hand at creating my own audio visual production. The results were...less than spectacular.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a linear, 3D graphic based, audio synced production.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to avoid working with native libraries, I used Three.JS (WebGL) for rendering and GNU Rocket for keyframing and music syncing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GNU Rocket was harder to setup on OSX than it needed to be. I lost hours on this. Additionally, the JS connector interface was poorly documented and if used wrong wouldn't allow you to sync with the rocket track view. Also, JavaScript for OpenGL is quite terrible for some workloads (many objects) due to JavaScript's single threaded model. On native, this overhead would be much lower and I would have more control over the rendering pipeline. More control wasn't the point though, as I have never even started a good production due to the native OpenGL overhead / boilerplate. Overall, getting
                    <em>
                        something
                    </em>
                    to work was an amazing accomplishment given my graphical inexperience.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I finally got GNU Rocket running for the first time in my life and made a
                    <em>
                        teaser
                    </em>
                    production. I was using a song without per-channel information, so I had to
                    <strong>
                        manually
                    </strong>
                    keyframe every interesting event, along with the camera. Needless to say, I couldn't keyframe everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Manual keyframing is hard, but thankfully GNU Rocket makes it feasible. Three.JS has major performance limitations involving GridHelper.

                <p>
                    I hope to add more keyframes and more effects to bring this "demo" out of the '90s.
