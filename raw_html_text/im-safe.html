                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the need to be safe when doing certain solitary activities, going on a blind date, or travelling alone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application sends your location data along with a timestamp to ObjectRocket's mongoDB via their interface and allows you to select who may monitor you during that activity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is build using Android Studio, Photoshop, and ObjectRocket's mongoDB interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I fought long and hard with Java's terrible layouts as well as the sheer slowness of development in Java.  In addition, we had issues with updating via ObjectRocket's interface, but mostly because the documentation was taken offline, so we had to use the Internet's wayback machine to find our mistakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application works and can currently be used to keep someone safe, in fact, my son is going to use it on his next hike.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything takes longer when developing in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for IM Safe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More testing, maybe a facelift, and some UI elements (like list selections) that make using this application more enjoyable.
