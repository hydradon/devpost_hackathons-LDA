                        Every day, everywhere, we are surrounded by people from all walks of life. Some have a vast amount of resources available to them, others have close to nothing. We created this game to raise awareness on the wide variety of lifestyles in our own neighborhoods. By understanding how gender, financial status, education, and hobbies shape our lives and social pyramid standings, we hope to create a more inclusive and open minded community. Our game also shows how different choices and events will impact one's social status.

                    : This is an life simulation game by simply swiping cards. You create your own virtual character and choose pathways to build your it. Once background information is complete, you will be given sets of choices that will allow you to progress through your virtual life.

                    How It Works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our webpage has two HTML files: main.html and welcome.html. Most of the work involved figuring out how to implement the swiping function, which we accomplished by using JavaScript and JQuery. The design for the website was coded in our style.css file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Processing program is made up of three classes: a main, story, and ending class. The story class creates the storyline of the game. Likewise, the ending class creates the list containing the advantages and disadvatages that come from specific combinations of backgrounds. Lastly, the main class serves as the base structure by composing the visuals and the functionality between all the classes and instance variables.
