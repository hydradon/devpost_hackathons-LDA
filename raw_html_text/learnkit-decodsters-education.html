                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Because we have gone through the phase where resources are not easily available at right time from authentic persons. We wanted to provide an interface where it is very feasible for the students to gain instant links and description of the content that they want.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, the website is all about the sharing of various resources like notes, various external links, etc. The resources are provided by various professors from all over the institute,  where she/he can stay in touch  by providing students the necessary materials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The student in turn can access these resources quickly and efficiently and he doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about the authenticity of the resources.
