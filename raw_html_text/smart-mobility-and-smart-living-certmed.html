                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Innocent lives are lost every day due to counterfeit medication hitting our shelves and supply chain
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CertiMed is a system that allow medical company to "sign" their medications onto the blockchain for retailers and hospitals to check whether the package they get is legitimate or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We embed RFID chips into every bottle of medicine, each RFID chip contains the item ID and a random string.
We also store the item ID of said item and the corresponding "key" for the random sting onto the blockchain.
Every time someone is trying to retrieve the data form the blockchain, it will record the access time and location.
In order to tamper with the medicine, you have to access the blockchain to know how to tamper the bottle.
Using AI technology it will be easy for us to detect suspicious activity.
