                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These days, virtual assistants such as Siri, Cortana, Google assistants, Amazon Alexa and many more are used to help users ease many tasks such as looking up the weather, making a note and setting a remainder. Many a times, people want to create much more than that, like an app or a website. Now with this open source application, we enable virtual assistants to do just that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is a mock up of a virtual assistant that helps the user seamlessly create a web page by simply taking suggestions from the user on what they want the website to look like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an application that uses Microsoft's speech recognition API to create a mock up of a virtual assistant that prompts the user and asks for suggestion in creating a web page. The users inputs are run through Microsoft Azure's Language Understanding system to interpret the suggestions and then a python script implements the suggestions as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a few challenges we faced such as setting up LUIS to pick up on the different ways a user may talk/suggest changes to the web page. We also had trouble in linking the audio across the different platforms and manipulating .wav audio format in python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of having used Azure products successfully within such a short span of time.
This has been one of our long term project ideas and we are proud that we were able to accomplish this!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to manipulate and work with Azure's speech recognition and language understanding APIs.
We also learned how web pages can be created and audio can be manipulated using python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SoYouThinkYouCanWebpage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step would be to expand the functionality. Within the time span of this hackathon, we were only able to create a basic web page creation functionality for the virtual assistant. We would like to expand this to allow the user to have more combustibility on the web page. We would also like to expand this idea to platforms beyond web development such as App development, C programming etc
