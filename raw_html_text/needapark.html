                    Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding parking space is often never easy for citizens in urban cities. For example, in New York City, it has been estimated that every drive spends an average of 107 hours a year to look for parking space, costing $2,243 in wasted time, fuel, and emissions per driver, and costing the whole city US$ 4.3 billion a year. Looking for parking space means extra CO2 emission, which is not positive for the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Opportunites and Solutions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nokia LuxTurrim5G smart poles are installed with HD cameras facing towards the ground. The camera monitors the parking spots on ground, and stream images (or videos) towards the cloud. In the cloud, AI is utilized to recognize which parking spaces are occupied or available and where they are. Since the pole location is known, this means that position information of parking spaces will be more accurate and driver will be able to navigate quicker / faster. The transmission of images / videos to the cloud is done through 5G, which allow for lower latency communication and faster delivery of information to the citizens. The LuxTurrim5G pole can also track the time on how long a vehicle has been parked in a particular location, and if that certain space has a time limit and the vehicle has overstayed in the parking, it can send alert to the parking officers so they can react faster to issue parking fines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Prototype
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We simulate the solution with using Raspberry Pi equipped with camera which simulates what happen at the LuxTurrim5G side. The camera takes a picture and transmits the image to the cloud via 5G, the cloud side is simulated as a Google Cloud instance which has Vision API enabled to perform recogniton of cars on the parking spaces based on the image taken by the camera. The information about available parking spaces can then be accessed and used by the citizen through a mobile app which allows them to find parking space according to their preference / need, and provides the route to reach the space more accurately, utilizing the location information of the LuxTurrim5G pole closest to the parking space.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally are a team of three. One of our members suddenly disappeared on Saturday without notifying us anything and without contributing anything at all. This costs us time and frustration, and we couldn't be productive on Saturday.

                <h2>
                    Business Model
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nokia can be data provider for third party companies or government who build their own application logic to find available parking spaces. In addition, Nokia can also be a player closer to the customer side where it provides a subscription service for citizens for them to find parking spaces faster.
