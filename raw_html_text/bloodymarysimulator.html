                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something about courage that included mirrors, escape rooms and the tale of Bloody Mary. What we got was all of that and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It plays on scale, making you a small person in a small room. It runs on the Vive. It takes you through the ups and downs of satanic 80's dance parties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the game in Unity for the HTC Vive. We built all of the art in Maya and a lot of the texturing was done in Substance Painter (and of course Photoshop).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought our scope was pretty small and we found out that it was not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished on time. It's actually scary and we can let other people play. We also got Pendelton Ward to make some art for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nick learned Substance. Sam, Andy, and Vincent learned a lot more about what you can do with the Vive. Chase learned how to use a computer.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully a Halloween release.
