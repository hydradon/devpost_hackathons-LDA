                    Solution context:
According to &ldquo;Houston Electric Vehicle (EV) Challenges&rdquo; from 2019 Houston&rsquo;s Climathon, &ldquo;Many people lack awareness of the pocketbook benefits of EVs, the subsidies available to EV purchasers, the environmental and health benefits of EVs, and the positive experience of driving an EV.  Awareness is a key driver for increasing EV adoption in a region.&rdquo;
