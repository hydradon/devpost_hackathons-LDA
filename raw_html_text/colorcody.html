                    Taking a closer look at the habits of successful people like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Dr. Dre, we see something that they all have in common: the tendency to wear the same thing every day. The reason behind this interesting phenomenon is simple. Smart people living in smart cities don't have the time to spend looking in their closets to decide what to wear. Since time is money, we want to quickly get to the important business of that day instead of wasting our time stressing over something so trivial as what color we should wear that day. That's where ColorCody come in!

                    ColorCody is a mobile app for iOS that suggests what color the user should wear each day. These colors are recommended through analyzing the answers that users submit at the app's first launch

                    This is made using Xcode and Swift. Drawings were done through Krita.

                    I learned how to create iOS applications. I also learned that my body gets cold with no sleep.

                    I am planning on implementing a notification alarm functionality. Also, the gathered data from user's rating of colors could be used to create an AI. The AI will focus on understanding the subconscious pattern of the user when choosing his or her color.
