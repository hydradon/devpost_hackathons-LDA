                    Traditionally, people have been looking at mean and variance for alpha signals. Oftentimes these are based on just 1 feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the rise of machine learning, more interesting and unconventional signals can be generated from a dataset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hypothesis of our project is to use clustering methods to generate state of the art alpha signals described by the clusters&rsquo; attributes, adding new and more complex ways of describing a dataset on top of the conventional statistics such as mean and variance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project investigates this hypothesis by looking at Social Media Analytics from Quandl to generate alpha signals for NVDA price.
