                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought about what an exciting time the summer of Pokemon Go was, when it first came out. We wanted to figure out a way to foster and empower the creation of art, while also encouraging walking and exploration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app encourages the creation of community and local art, by providing a unique way to showcase it. It encourages users to explore their community and search for local art, thereby promote walking and a healthier lifestyle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Radar.io for our geofencing backend. We use Google Cloud and the Maps API for our maps. We used FireDB for our database/backend. The whole app was made in React as a PWA
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Radar.io to work was pretty difficult, we couldn't find a lot of documentation and had some issues due to unique GET headers that threw off Axios. We also had some issues with wifi, and a lot of disconnects/connection problems with our IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting Radar.Io to work fully on our project was awesome. We've been able to add Geofences in app as a user, using their API. We're also able to query the API to figure out what GeoFences the user is in or not in at any time, and use this context in app. Getting the camera working and being able to take photos was also pretty great!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a ton about React, FireDB, and Radar.io. We also got a lot more experience using google cloud products such as FireDB and the Maps API for Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CruzCrafts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to add user logins and stickers so users are encourages to explore and can track/be rewarded for their project. We also want to add more dynamic hints/exploration through something such as AR.
