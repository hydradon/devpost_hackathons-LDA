                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    manhunt improved (vim pun)

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    App that enables games of manhunt with very large playing field. App shows the location of the closest player on the opposing team to disincentivize camping and make the game easier for the people who are it to catch other players.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python/Flask backend hosted on Azure VPS + RN frontend + expo.io

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to write a backend in Go, but after having trouble integrating our frontend and backen  for ~6-7 hours, we gave up and rewrote the whole thing in Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ran into accuracy issues with our math when calculating distance between any two longitude/latitude coordinates, and had to try various solutions before finding one that worked well.
