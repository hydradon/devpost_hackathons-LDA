                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are Electrical Engineers with an interest in robotics, and thought it would be a fun project to work on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a tank that can drive around and fire rubber bands using a moveable turret.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the last minute, our microcontrollers completely burned out and everything stopped working. We would like to be considered for the last minute flop award.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Literally everything except the last ten minutes of this competition.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Minimal functionality before fancy features.
