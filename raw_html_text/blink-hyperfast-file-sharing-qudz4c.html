                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the highly developed devices and sensors (high-resolution camera, 4k videos), people have much more opportunity to have GBs&rsquo; media. However, it is hard to share those contents with other people. Sending an email and using messaging platforms have file size limits and low speed. Using a cloud service is cumbersome because we want to share just one file instantly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our solution, powered by 5G technology, GPS location, and gRPC streaming connection, we suggest a new media transfer service. We build the fastest supercar!

                <p>
                    After IPv6 becomes ordinary, so edge device has its own IP, our service discovery server will be the
                    <strong>
                        service discovery server
                    </strong>
                    , which means what the server does is only discovery,
                    <strong>
                        not even touch the file.
                    </strong>
                    Our server will open a temporary web server while sharing the file. By super-speed downloading speed, sharing the file in our normal life will be more convenient and easy.

                    Accomplishments &amp; What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We solved the traditional server overload problem that it had to be store all of the files that users want to send, by using 5G technology and P2P connection. Everything we handled was first time to us; Android native programming, server programming combining gRPC and Go, etc. But we did it! It was an amazing experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also learned how to handle network protocols and 5G. It was nice experience to try state of the art network technology :)
