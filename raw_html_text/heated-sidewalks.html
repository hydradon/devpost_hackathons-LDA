                    Inspiration We were inspired by this problem initially because it is something that we can all relate to.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does Our solution heats the sidewalk and melts the snow/ice through solar energy. The water that is left over is drained through a nearby drainage basin.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it We built this prototype using Arudino and some other hardware components to better explain what we want our system to do.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into We initially thought to not go through with this design as we had not heat pads and pressure sensors. We later decided that we will use alternative hardware components to represent the devices we did not have.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of Instead of finding a band-aid solution, we found a sustainable and permanent fix.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned We learned how to work with Arduinos and how to connect simple circuitry components.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Heated Sidewalks We want to find a better way to implement the drainage system when there is a lot of snow/ice so that we don't have a flood.
