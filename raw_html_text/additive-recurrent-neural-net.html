                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the ability of recurrent nets to learn cyclical patterns, and I wanted something that could learn a cyclical pattern in a smooth space, like a sin wave over continuous numbers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For each frame x_i, the net computes the output f(x_i) and adds it to the state, so that x_{i+1} = x_i + f(x_i).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By hand
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It turned out Theano didn't help the project at all, because I was just doing an exploration, and didn't need backpropogation. Therefore I ditched it and implemented a neural net by hand.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Good proof of concept of cyclical behavior.
