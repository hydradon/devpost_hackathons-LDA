                    ECLAT - Equivalent CLAss Transformation, a highly efficient algorithm to mine correlations between items. This is a Neo4j database extension that implements mining and creating of Associated Rules from transaction data(item set). The classic use cases are shopping cart analysis, recommendations, intelligent search etc.

                    What is Associated Rules Mining?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Association rule mining is a procedure which is meant to find frequent patterns, correlations, associations, or causal structures from data sets found in various kinds of databases such as relational databases, transactional databases, and other forms of data repositories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given a set of transactions, association rule mining aims to find the rules which enable us to predict the occurrence of a specific item based on the occurrences of the other items in the transaction. Today we will be focusing on ECLAT algorithm and its entension on neo4j.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most well known examples of Associated Rulke Mining is probably 'diappers and beer' through shopping cart mining in which a high correlation had been revealed between these 2 products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several Associated Rules Mining algorithms. The most often mentioned is Apriori, and the one of higher efficiency is ECLAT.
                </p>

                    Apriori Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apriori is an algorithnm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.
                </p>

                    ECLAT Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ECLAT algorithm stands for Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal. It is one of the popular methods of Association Rule mining. It is a more efficient and scalable version of the Apriori algorithm. While the Apriori algorithm works in a horizontal sense imitating the Breadth-First Search of a graph, the ECLAT algorithm works in a vertical manner just like the Depth-First Search of a graph. This vertical approach of the ECLAT algorithm makes it a faster algorithm than the Apriori algorithm. The basic idea is to use Transaction Id Sets(tidsets) intersections to compute the support value of a candidate and avoiding the generation of subsets which do not exist in the prefix tree.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    This will return 22 records.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before we actually run the algorithm, let's create an Index to improve database  performance for update:
                </p>
                <p>
                    CREATE INDEX ON :ARItem(id)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now let's use the above query as the input to ECLAT algorithm:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img alt="Test1-call" data-canonical-url="http://codingisforeveryone.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/call-eclat.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--o8a4uATr--/c_limit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto:eco,w_900/http://codingisforeveryone.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/call-eclat.png">
                </p>
                <p>
                    The query finished in 9 seconds, and created 282 associated rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some tips:
1) We use filter on size((Group) -[:HOSTED_EVENT]-&gt; (Event)) &gt; 100 to only return active groups that have enough events hosted, which will reduce total transactions / item sets;
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) We use 0.1 / 10% of returned transactions as minSupportRatio, which is 3 after rounded as the minimal support level(threshold). Topic(s) (Item / Itemset) that has been referred by Groups over this threshold will be included as associated rules. Always make sure this value is at least 2, otherwise all items and possible subsets will be included(once the support is 1), which can cause a lot of useless rules created.

By having both confidence and degree, it's possibile to further define a weighte score like 'relevance', which considers both relevance to this topic, as well as relevance to overall topics.
