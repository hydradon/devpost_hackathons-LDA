                    Inspiration &amp; What it Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snapchat is trying to replace news channels by collecting snaps and generating short clips that are easier to watch due to people's short attention spans. So instead, I took videos that are already being produced by well known news channels and shortened them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created a website with Python and Flask where users can follow different news companies and view shortened news videos in their feeds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For some reason, authentication wasn't working for Microsoft's Cognitive Services Video API, so I couldn't generate the thumbnails like I originally wanted to; instead, I made gifs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for snapnews
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I'd like to implement Cognitive Services properly and add a greater variety of news companies.
