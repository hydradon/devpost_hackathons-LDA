                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept behind this project was an application that would easily keep track of financial expenses. This is because most applications split such planning for the future into too many separate parts. In other words, we wanted an application that puts one's budget on the calendar.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DiamondFinance allows the user to specify typical sources of income and expenses, as well as one-time purchases, bills, and rewards. It then allows the user to look ahead and see when they will have enough money to buy item(s) safely.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app uses Django (and thus Python) as its backend and a combination of HTML, JS,  and CSS on the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hardest part of the project was tied to the feature that predicts future balance changes. We found that it was very difficult to make this function efficiently. We ultimately settled on a solution that, though less efficient in some circumstances, will likely encounter fewer errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a fully functioning calendar that can predict the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that is it surprisingly challenging to write code when you have been awake for more than 18 hours straight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actually, though, we gained a much better understanding of the inner workings of the various languages we used, especially Django and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DiamondFinance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While some of us worked on the backend, others worked on various functions related to certain aspects of finance such as compound interest for banks and 401k prediction. In addition, we attempted to implement a feature that would allow customers to search for prices for specific items on popular websites. Unfortunately, none of these made it into the final application due to time constraints. In the future, we may implement one or more of these features.
