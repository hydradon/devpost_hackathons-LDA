                <p>
                    Our product recognizes various gestures that are typically used in strength training exercises for cerebral palsy patients. It uses this recognition to control various web based games. Throughout the game, the difficulty increases and becomes more challenging and more fun. This is expected to engage patients and encourage them to continue their physical therapy exercises outside of the clinic.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the thalmic labs myo armband as a controller, codepen.io as a front-end developer, and various open sourced games coded in Javascript.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was very difficult to connect the recognized gestures into controls for the games.
