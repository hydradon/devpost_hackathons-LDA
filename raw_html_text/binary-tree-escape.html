                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Though binary trees can seem intuitive to experienced programmers, explaining them to even intermediate programmers can be quite challenging. Truly, they are best explained through a visual representation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making challenging computer science concepts understandable through the use of VR is the purpose of our virtual reality education startup, CSVR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a minigame that is part of our overall product the player must escape a maze using the properties of a binary search tree, along with the help of their faithful robot canine companion! The dog also helps explain binary search trees further to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Unity, the Oculus Rift, and Blender.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the 3D models, such as the maze and the robot dog was challenging, but our team has had experience with VR and Blender.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of how we were able to implement such a challenging concept in a unique and enjoyable way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make data structures less complicated to explain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Binary Tree Escape
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue developing the game, creating more levels and exploring more functions of a binary search tree. It will be a part of our full-fledged product that will explain data structures and other advanced programming concepts.
