                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we open our fridge, we don't always know what we want to eat. Inspired also by being hungry, sitting at an isolated table at PennApps.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses machine learning to recognize and identify key food staples. Then, it can provide recipes that the user can easily cook using the ingredients in their fridge.

                    Using TensorFlow, Keras, and Python. Found fruit image dataset online, other datasets (vegetable, condiments, eggs, meat, dairy) created by us.
