                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3/4 of us are taking linear algebra right now and wanted to do something regarding that since it would solidify/further our understanding linear algebra and of computer science/programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It calculates the determinant of a 3x3 matrix that the user inputs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used domain.coms free domain to host our calculator. We went through a lot of trial and error. First we wanted to have a matrix multiplication calculator, but after a few hours of not making any progress we decided to go smaller. We then wanted to make an inverse calculator for matrices, but the issue for that was figuring out how to write the matrix to the web page, so finally we decided to settle on calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically all of us are only familiar with Java programming, so we had to figure out aspects of html and javascript in order to have this work. We tried to use python and html, researching flask, our very first framework, but we had too many complications with having the website run the calculator properly.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are freshmen and this is our first hackathon, and are glad that we were able to turn a project in, especially something in a language that we weren't totally confident in using.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That no endeavor is a wasted one. Attempting to work with flask was a great learning experience for us and now we know way more than we knew 2 days ago
                </p>

                    What's next for 3x3 Matrix Determinant Calculator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have the user be able to change the size of the matrix and perform other operations, such as calculating the inverse and calculating the product of two matrices.
