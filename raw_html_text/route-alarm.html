                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As busy people in a society that can often have traffic jams, weather changes, and delays in our travel, we simply can't afford to arrive late at important meetings. With Route Alarm, we fix this problem by adjusting the alarm time that you set to allow you to arrive even when traffic may be congested.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Route Alarm accesses
                    <strong>
                        Google API
                    </strong>
                    and uses the
                    <strong>
                        Maps API
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        Weather API
                    </strong>
                    to detect any possible delays in traffic along the route you take between two locations. Based on the possible delay, it adjusts your alarm so that you still arrive at expected time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was able to build this application by focusing on resources provided by the Google Maps API. In addition to this, we provided accurate weather using the Weather API. Alarms and other settings were stored using data structures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are unable to fully test the application because we have not used it in actual travel. Many of the elements we used had to be learned on the fly because we did not have too much knowledge or experience with Android Studios or Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to creating a successful application. We are proud that we were able to absorb so much knowledge from the teams around us. We did not know what to expect when coming into this hackathon. Because of this, we are proud that we were able to put our efforts together and create something great with the little time we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio and how to use Google APIs. Track traffic patterns if the same path is traveled daily to get more accurate traffic data since traffic changes through out the day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Route Alarm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possible Uber/Lyft Integration with access to prices and possibly even have an option to schedule an Uber at the time when the alarm rings to pick you when you get ready. Another Idea we had was to track the users standard route to create a more accurate time for commute using statistics.
