                    I am the CEO and a founder of Teamkraft mobile platform. The idea of the app is simple - it helps people do sports together and network through sports. 
This February I was invited to Eth Denver by a friend of mine. I knew absolutely nothing about blockchain before I came there. When learned the basics of Blockchain, I was amazed that so many trust related issues in my platform can finally be solved using blockchain and decided to develop the solution during the next hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having tested the product on more than 10k users, I don&rsquo;t only believe but I know that the future of arbitration in amateur sports is blockchain based.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can use the app for free to find a company to do sports with. If users would like to receive &amp; grant badges, they will have to link an Eth wallet address to their Teamkraft account. Meetup participants will be able to give Merit Badges (based on ERC20 token) to players after Meetups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Teams and players that challenge each other on Teamkraft will be able to store match results on the Blockchain as well. As a result, you keep your sports trusted profile and achievements wherever you travel and get free access to players in proximity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why blockchain is the optimal solution for us?
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Players and teams will be in direct control of their sports activities and achievements, rather than being controlled by leagues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Instead of just investing millions in user acquisition, we can invest this money in the amateur sports community by giving them incentives and access to tournaments with free prizes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This will help us reduce transaction costs (appstore's cut on sold badges, bank fees, etc) and legal burden related to tournament prizes.
                    </li>
