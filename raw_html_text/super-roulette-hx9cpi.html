                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having always enjoyed playing free online social casino games, we thought that it was time the experience was transitioned on to voice devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Super Roulette is a voice experience designed to allow the user to enjoy playing the popular casino game in the comforts of their own home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the ASK CLI command line package to create the project. Using JavaScript we built the skeleton for the initial skill, implementing features such as simple bets on positions of the board. We then implemented the chips being shown on the users bet on screen devices. The screen needed to be split up in to several components to enable us to drop chips on the exact place on the roulette board that the user has specified. After inspiration from online, we then decided to implement some animations to the skill. Using pagers we added a spinning coin to indicate the winning number on screen devices. The final step was to introduce touch to the skill for screen devices. We created touch wrappers for every component on the board so that the users could tap the space that they wanted to place a bet on. Each tap on a space increments the bet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we we ran in to was that of implementing video intros and short cut scenes in to the skill. We found that the videos were very inconsistent with the way that they played. Another challenge that we faced was the fact that it was difficult for us to test our skill in multiple languages. None of us are native French, German or Spanish speakers so it was clearly difficult to be able to test the skill in these languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are particularly proud of the way that the game places chips on the screen. The board had to be split up in to many different parts that the user can place a bet on. Making sure chips were put on the correct spots was a challenge, but adds a nice visual element to the game which I am proud of. The overall professional nature of the skill is another accomplishment that we are proud of. We designed and implemented a layout which we though looked sleek and professional and researched to find sounds to match the feel. The addition of an intro video, with Alexa talking over it adds to the immersion of the skill. Another accomplishment that we are proud of is the fact that the skill looks great on multiple screen devices. The skill is not only playable on voice only devices, but scales accordingly to different screen devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The building of this skill provided a fantastic learning curve for us. Creating a multi-modal voice first experience, I feel that our skills in developing with APL have greatly improved. The issues that we overcame with things such as APL video, paging and touch-wrappers means that we learned a great deal about how they work and plan to use them a lot more in the future.

                <p>
                    We aim to implement various different types of bonuses to the game and account linking so that players can use the same bank pool over various different casino games.
