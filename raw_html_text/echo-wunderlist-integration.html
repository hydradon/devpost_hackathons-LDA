                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create easy lists and tasks for users to check through. Amazon Echo is pretty restrictive, so we decided to give any user more access and freedom with their schedule planners by creating this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By utilizing Wunderlist's API, we have achieved adding new lists, opening lists, and creating new tasks for users to check through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Wunderlist API and java in order to write a service application for the Amazon Echo.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trust us, it would take longer to explain that than to actually present.
Internet connection to the Amazon echo.
Communication between Wunderlist and the java program.

                <p>
                    We got the Amazon Echo to actually listen to us!
