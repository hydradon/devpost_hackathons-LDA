                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trust issue is not only a show stopper in some deals, but it also makes companies spend a lot of time on business transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main idea is to use
                    <strong>
                        trust rating
                    </strong>
                    on our platform to make marketplace more transparent and client trustworthy.
                    <strong>
                        Trust rating
                    </strong>
                    is being calculated based on the following parameters: total payed historic amount, summary of payments, summary of delayed time.
Besides the
                    <strong>
                        trust rating
                    </strong>
                    we also introduced more flexible buy/rent model where client is being able to configure additional services, while also being able to proceed with the base price.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although decentralized ledger can be used in this model it still has many downsides and solve trust issues only partially, that's why we used centralized ledger and build our project using react, nodejs and postgres.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    The main challenge was to decide between different approach how to make marketplace transparent and still simple, user friendly.
