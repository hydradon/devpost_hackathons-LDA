                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time working with a real-time database that provided issues with pushing and pulling data succinctly
Understanding Google's Map APIs was a bit challenging at first
Creating a fast responsive front-end that could dynamically load/send data from/to Firebase while generating markers for each point of interest
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developed something that we feel could actually be applied around the world
Worked on a project that has a lot of potential for growth
Implemented something that we would love to continue to work on and later (globally) deploy as an app in the future
