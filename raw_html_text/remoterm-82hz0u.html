                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At some point, we all needed to access our home computer for various reasons. Whether it was for checking local files, or rerunning the server, or just having some music playing when we come from work, it would have been nice to do all of these while away. remoTerm makes this possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a nutshell, remoTerm is a daemon that runs on our home computer. It listens for emails or text messages that we send to it, executes the commands that are in them, and replies with the terminal output. It is platform agnostic, meaning that it does not need an app on the commanding device, just a mail or messaging client.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mail address and phone number should belong to the app installation alone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built in pure Python, with Twilio's API for SMS registration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Within the team, most of us were not very proficient with the Python language, this project allowed us to learn about python and its methods.
Some of our team members became ill and therefore a lot of tasks had to be split between the rest of the remaining team members.
Being the first time using Twilio, we faced many bugs and spent a lot of time debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program works! We managed to get the entire program to work with email input and output, and SMS messaging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt about how to use Python, the Twilio API and using Ngrock.
