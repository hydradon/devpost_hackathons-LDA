                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help educate people about the real changes business help illicit in our society through the way we eat, shop and where we choose to volunteer. We understand that changing our habits can be a bumpy road, so we think it's essential that we create this platform so that does who want to can easily make that change without the hours we put into finding these locations/programs.

                <p>
                    Our website is made up of HTML and CSS. With each mention that we make we have added links to the company's website, information that includes their contact info and location. We've also added an instagram image for each mention that directs you to the instagram page of the organization/business that you are looking at.

                    We wanted to incorporate more functionality through javaScript but we our skills are not there yet. We definitely want to continue to improve that aspect of our website.
