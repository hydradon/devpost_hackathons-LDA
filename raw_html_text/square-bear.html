                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were taken with the "Best Grizz Hack" challenge, and wanted to create a game with an endearing bear as a main character. From here, we based the principles of the game's design on classic side-scrollers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You control a bear as it jumps across platforms, swats bees, dodges spiders, and flees from menacing deer in its pursuit of honey. The game prototype consists of one platforming level and a special boss encounter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was built within the Unity engine and coded in C#. Music and sound was made with MuseScore, and most art was created in the Piskel web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our team was very new to Unity, so there was a steep learning curve to overcome. Because of the many components that make up a video game (animations, damage systems, physics interactions, etc), dividing tasks also often meant that someone would have to make a significant time contribution to understand the new system they were designing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the challenges, we were able to create a stable sidescroller with many of the mechanics we had envisioned at the start. The team also came away with a more full understanding of the Unity game engine, which was a personal educational goal for our group.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a better understanding of Unity and collaborating as a team within that framework to create a single product. Many of our team were also new to C# and came away with a working understanding of the basics of its syntax, as well as Unity-specific programming concepts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Square Bear
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps with some tweaks to the physics system, improvements to level layout, and expansion of mechanics, Square Bear could be expanded into a an even fuller gaming experience!
