                        Currently under development. We were only able to come up with most of the basic front end as we taught ourselves iOS development from scratch beginning 12:00 AM Saturday.

                        Rewards based learning is always more effective than normal learning
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reward your child with a certain amount of money every time he/she completes a target number of assignments meeting the standard that YOU set for completion of those assignments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Complete customisation: Be in control of what your child studies. Pick a target number of assignments, set a difficulty level, set a minimum level of proficiency that each assignment must be completed with, and finally, set your child's reward for meeting the targets set by you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you update your preferences or add a new target, your child gets notified and when your child finishes an assignment, you get notified.
