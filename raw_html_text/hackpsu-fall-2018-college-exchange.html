                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of us noticed how students at our college had difficultly exchanging goods and services on the crowed news feed of the class Facebook page and we wanted to alleviate this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website offers students to sell and search for commodities as books, car rides, clothes, services, and housing. Our intent was to use Google's Vision and Search APIs to interpret the covers of books.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We each divided up the project to design a different portion of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges designing the python script to interpret the images as we originally wanted it to. 
We ran into several issues with PHP not wanting to run on the Ride Share page
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were all able to come together and create a project for, most of us, our first HackPSU.
