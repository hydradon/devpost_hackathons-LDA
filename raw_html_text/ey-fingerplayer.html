                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built using OpenCV, custom colour tracking/thresholding and gesture recognition algorithms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Traditional deep learning networks are relatively slow and thus introduce too much input lag into the game, resulting in it being pretty unplayable. We had to design our own algorithm from scratch for each gesture feature to map to each button press.
