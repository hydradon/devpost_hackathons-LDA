                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to use Firebase for a Pebble app, and let people "toss" pebbles at each other. We then pivoted to making our Toss idea into a web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bootstrap for the front end, Firebase for the backend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you first load Toss in your browser, you are assigned onto the Blue or Red team, and given the opportunity to do you first "Toss", which tosses a "pebble" into your team's pile, giving you (and your team) a point, and gives you five votes to spend on your team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to toss again you need to spend "votes" given to you by your team. Your future tosses have a cost equal to the amount of points you've earned for your team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is to facilitate teamwork between players of the same team as they try to accomplish a faster "toss and vote" loop between their team mates, helping each other beat the other team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the team's first time using Firebase, and some of the concepts that Firebase uses are new to the team, such as the async, ordering data, and callback stuff. Even though we had a bunch of issues, and have some incompleteness, we all learned a lot about how Firebase works (it's awesome) and some advanced javascript stuff (which is also awesome).
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was the person who did the front end's first time using Bootstrap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, Chrome doesn't like it when a local html file sets cookies. Firefox is cool with it. That was an hour wasted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of how we dealt with problems as we approached them. We came to the hackathon with no ideas, but had an awesome brainstorming session and pivoted several times throughout the weekend as we learned more about how Firebase worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Toss
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add perks that players can spend their individually accumulated points on to give players more of an incentive to continue their play session over time and rack up points. A chat may also be cool.
                </p>
