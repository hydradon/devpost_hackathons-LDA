                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UpAhead was created with those who struggle with visual impairment in mind. This technology tackles common issues associated with visual impairments to improve one's quality of life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UpAhead uses azure cognitive apis and raspberry pi cameras to help people with visual impairment navigate around places with independence and confidence. The raspberry pi camera attaches to a user's glasses and lets them know if they are about to hit into an object or if there are any obstacles in the way. UpAhead keeps people safe while giving them full exploring abilities without needing a cane or a services dog.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used multiple Microsoft Azure Cognitive Service APIs to create a fully immersive and customer focused solution. We used the computer vision API to detect obstacles in the users' surroundings. We used the Azure text to speech API to notify users through an ear piece or speaker about these obstacles, such as trees, pedestrians, stop signs, etc. To improve accessibility in our product, UpAhead comes in 45 different languages, which was implemented using Microsoft Azure's translate text API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UpAhead ran into challenges setting up the raspberry pi and working with Python since these are two technologies that are new to the team. Through hard work and determination, UpAhead learned to overcome these challenges and acquire new skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we properly set up all three APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code in Python, set up APIs, and use a raspberry pi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UpAhead
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UpAhead has plans to dive into the AI world to constantly improve its image recognition, increase speed for more accurate real time feedback, and add new obstacles that can be detected to improve safety for users.
