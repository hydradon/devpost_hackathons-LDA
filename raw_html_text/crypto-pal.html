                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Foster adoption of crypto services and products by non-tech-savvy consumers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the limiting factors for crypto-based services / products mass adoption today is the need for users to understand how the inner mechanics of blockchain work - at least to a certain extent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let&rsquo;s face it: if you want to start using crypto powered products and services, in the best case scenario you need to go on Coinbase and buy ETH or BTC, transfer them to Binance or another centralized / decentralized exchange and buy the tokens you need for the service of your choice. After that, you need to transfer the tokens bought to the platform of your interest in order to use their service. That&rsquo;s not trivial for most people outside of this room.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to open up this market, making it easily usable for the average, non-tech user. CryptoPal makes users buy crypto services in their native tokens using USD (and other major currencies in the future) without ever needing to know that the services they&rsquo;re using and paying for are crypto-based.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed a fiat proxy, integrated with
                    <strong>
                        Wyre
                    </strong>
                    for KYC / AML verification, that is supported by a stable coin - in our case
                    <strong>
                        DAI
                    </strong>
                    . We then deployed a smart contract to keep track of balances and integrated it with
                    <strong>
                        0x DEX
                    </strong>
                    in order to buy the crypto needed for the service the user decides to buy. With the balance of the token, we then proceed to the payment of the crypto-based service.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Integration with DEX - because of the logic and how it works.
