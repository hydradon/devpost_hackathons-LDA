                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -The Inspiration behind this was the problems with gangs and drugs in the lives of minorities. We wanted a way to tell a story and get people the help they need.
-We came up with the name by thinking of wanting to find a way to "cure" gangs, and a synonym for gangs is cabal, so: Cabal Cure.
                </p>

                    -The first tab tells a short story about a boy and his brother getting into some trouble with a gang and drugs.
-The second tab gives links to resources and services to prevent people from joining gangs and falling into bad habits with drugs
