                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Want to empower people, especially those who cannot use their hands, to take control of their music by using their brain waves
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Controls music playback via blinking and brain wave changes
Blinking twice in succession will pause/play the current song, and changing brain waves between a calm/excited state will switch you into a calm/excited playlist, respectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How did you Make It
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Muse headset was used to collect EEG and EMG data from the head via four electrodes on the forehead.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data from the Muse is streamed real time to the Muse Monitor app, which then streams it via WiFi to a specific IP and port via UDP and OSC.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A computer listens in on the port and receives the EEG data via the python package python-osc. Specifically, we receive information from each of the four electrode on the raw EEG trace data, and five frequency bands - alpha, beta, theta, gamma, and delta waves, which are associated with different brain states.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The real time streaming EEG and frequency data is formatted as Python Deque which keeps a fixed size memory of 3 seconds of data. The memory is read every second to determine whether there was a blink or a brain state change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A blink is registered when the raw EEG signal from the appropriate electrodes register a drop of sufficient magnitude, followed by a return to baseline, followed by a similar drop. This is tested in a scrolling window to register when the user blinks twice in succession.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An ordinary least squares binary classifier determines whether the user&rsquo;s eyes are open or closed. The weights for the classifier were generated from running OLS on tens of thousands of data points and can be calibrated for individuals with a single scan (code provided). A three second scrolling window determines whether the user purposely changed their eyes to open or closed.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Gathering non-noise EEG data is considerably difficult. We tried both the OpenBCI Ganglion and the Muse, which a variety of software packages and APIs. In the end we found reliable eye blink and simple brain state change from calm/alert signal with the Muse.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Streaming data from Muse to Python is difficult due to little developer support from Muse. We tried a variety of possible mediums to transmit data - over WiFi, over Bluetooth.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    -Collected, transmitted, processed, and classified reliable eye blink and brain stage signals. Reliability is arguably the biggest challenge in building brain computer interfaces.
