                    OVERWHELMING!! - a feeling that no one enjoys. On average, any given restaurant in Philly sees 250 customers or more, daily. With that comes reservations, tables, seating, and a lot of organization and coordination. The Rest &amp; Reservation team is here to relieve that tension and make dining out an enjoyable experience, for both the customer and the restaurant owner. We&rsquo;re beginner hackers who are currently high school students in NJ. Our application employs technology all the way from Twilio to Google in order to:
Make reservations by texting the restaurant
Ensuring these times are available for the customer
Creating an employee directory with employee profiles
