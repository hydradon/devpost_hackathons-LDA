                <p>
                    Nowadays, many Universities offer lecture recordings to students so that they may brush op on topics if they were not paying attention, or could not attend the lecture.
However, re-watching lectures can be a tedious activity: Convoluted presentations, exuberant rhetorical pauses, and the often slow and excursive presentation style of certain instructors often form an impediment to the efficient recapitulation of essential topics.
Thus, we felt the need for a solution to these everyday problems, so that students can be freed from the agonies associated with the watching of lecture recordings.

                    The LASY-Suite provides students with a set of programs that aim to ease the consumption of lecture recordings.
Since time is often a valuable resource for the student of the 21st century, we try to reduce the time consumption when watching lecture recordings by introducing the
                    <strong>
                        Lecture Accelerator an Silence Yanker (LASY)
                    </strong>
                    . This Program shortens lecture recordings by cutting out phases of silence and by accelerating the playback speed of the recording.
We also developed a program called
                    <strong>
                        LSTAT
                    </strong>
                    (Lecture Statistics), which uses state of the art AI technologies to convert the spoken information within the recording into text, in order to ease the process of searching for specific information within the individual lectures. In addition to that, LSTAT also performs a rigorous analyses of the extracted data to provide interesting statistics on the lecture.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LASY and LSTAT are programmed in Java, and are thus platform independent.  LASY uses ffmpeg to manipulate the recordings, and LSTAT analyses the lecture using gcloud services.

                    We intend to publish the source code of the LASY-Suite under a free Software licence, in the hope that other Students may also benefit form our efforts and can contribute to the future development of the project.
