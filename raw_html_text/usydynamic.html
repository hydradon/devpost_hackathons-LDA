                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clubs and societies are a vital part of student life. The University of Sydney has more than 200 student societies, the largest in Australia. The absence of a central app that collects information about the time, dates and venues of the events run by all the societies that a student has joined makes it inconvenient for students to stay up to date with society gatherings.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    USYDynamic is a website that collects information about the societies that a student has joined, and adds the event details on a personalised calendar for the student. It also includes a recommendation feature to recommend new clubs that aligns with the students uses - with over 200 clubs, it's hard to manually keep track of them all!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS and javascript to design the front end of the website. We used Photoshop and Sketch to make logos and UI design.
