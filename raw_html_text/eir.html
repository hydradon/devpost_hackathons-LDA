                    In order to make the process of illustrating complex tasks possible in a very short amount of time, we planned on adding a feature that automatically recommends relevant illustration setups to the emergency responders, so that they can find the right information for the right task in the shortest time possible with minimum manual searches. We were going to implement this feature using IBM's Speech-to-Text API, popularized by the
                    <strong>
                        Watson
                    </strong>
                    machine. This API allows us to predefine a set of indicator keywords that allows the algorithm to quickly classify relevant information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our implementation of this last feature was hampered by the difficulty of cloning the
                    <strong>
                        AudioStream
                    </strong>
                    component of a
                    <strong>
                        VideoStream
                    </strong>
                    in Android in real time. Given more time, we will implement this feature, and use it to ensure that
                    <strong>
                        Medical Responders
                    </strong>
                    are reminded of relevant queries they need to know; from this, improved patient outcomes will inevitably result.

                    The application itself consists of an

                    </strong>

                    </strong>

                        HTML/CSS/JS
                    </strong>
                    , which is designed for a medical responder to communicate with the caller more effectively than is possible through traditional, voice-only communication in a 911 call.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These two applications communicate through

                    </strong>
                    , because we had some issues installing the software when it came to that. Additionally, we had troubles implementing our foray into the
                    <strong>
                        IBM's Watson API
                    </strong>
                    , mostly streaming from the fact that we would have been required to separate an audio stream from a video stream on the fly in real time on the Android device.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to implement two features inexplicably absent from emergency response today:
                    <strong>
                        Graphical Advice Giving
                    </strong>
                    (implemented through the Canvas) and
                    <strong>
                        Video Streaming from the Scene
                    </strong>
                    (implemented through Sinch). We feel that these two additions will have a tangibly beneficial effect on patient outcomes in regards to emergency response.

                        Socially conscious hacking
                    </strong>
                    is important to us; too often is innovation ignored, at least when it comes to projects with limited revenue potential at first glance. We believe that the tried-and-true Silicon Valley way of tackle old problems with distruptive software solutions should be applied to the public sector for the public good, and we are proud to have followed our beliefs up with action.
