                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Global Health Innovation Center at Stanford in collaboration with the U.S. Department of State expressed a need for a innovative mosquito risk mapping and advisory system in response to the threat of mosquito-borne disease. The request was in particular in relation to the
                    <em>
                        Aedes
                    </em>
                    mosquito, which transmits zika, yellow fever, and dengue. Leveraging recent innovations in spatiotemporal risk mapping for infectious disease, we prototyped a Risk Advisory Dashboard that could be used to enable cost-effective resource allocation and targeted planning for mosquito-borne disease surveillance and control. Digital dashboards have been successfully implemented to support monitoring of businesses. Our Risk Advisory Dashboard (RAD) brings this strategy into the realm of global health, enabling data-driven decision-making.

                    What it does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Risk Advisory Dashboard uses the output of a multi-factor predictive model to provide clear actions for public health entities (CDC, WHO), NGOs and governmental development agencies, and the general public.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We researched pre-existing risk mapping models for infectious disease and developed a relevant dashboard prototype using Sketch.

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Per our communication with Joshua Glasser at the U.S. Department of State, there are multiple potential users for a product of this nature. A significant challenge was determining which governmental agencies to whom we should tailor our action items, given the numerous stakeholders in mosquito and disease control.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are multi-disciplinary team, consisting of design, biomedical engineering, global health, and tech development expertise. It was a wonderful experience to come together and learn from each other.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When working with government, it is necessary to consider the numerous stakeholders involved in implementing policy. Everyone, from a single individual all the way up to the highest level of the U.S. Government, can play a role in fighting infectious disease.
