                <h2>
                    Inspiration -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were students, we had to walk everywhere forget
 the public transportation, which was severely lacking in order to reach a place. After begging for rides from friends and spending thousands of dollars on uber, A free, secure bike rental service seemed to be a great idea, with smart locks, encryption system and drop off stations for students ease.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does-
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app, BikeShare, will create an account for a student with a student email id, and register it in the database, encrypted (the information will be safe) and when they log in to the app, it gives the date, time and person logging in and prompts a password for extra security. When they are ready to return the bike, they drop it off in a station anag again the prompt will appear in order to check with the available bikes. The person can use their phone GPS to find the nearest location of the BikeShare station. An Arduino controller board will help in locking and unlocking mechanism.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    How we built it-
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Backend encryption, database, RESTful API- it connects the app to server to update the database, was done using Python by Carlos and the front end was prepared by Sreenidhi. Jesse prepared the mechanical lock system with arduino for transmitting the code between the app, backend and the processor to unlock or lock the bike
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sreenidhi never used Android studio and java coding before, so most of the problems she ran into were coding and development related, but we pulled through and have a completed app. 3D printer also caused trouble by printing the part wrong, so we had to re do that from Jesse's end. Carlos created the API which was very complicated but in the end we have a finished product!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all did the parts out of our comfort zone and the entire team pulled through properly. They all did their part well and they delivered excellent projects to present. The team work was incredible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathon is fun and we should not over work ourselves by just coding. We should mingle and network as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BikeShare app for UTT and TIP -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we are working on a template to sync all three separate projects and put a payment mechanism on the app so that if the city needs to make money from Bikeshare, they can be assured that it is very safe and encrypted. We are also going to make Bike availability locations ready so we can know where to go when we need bikes.
