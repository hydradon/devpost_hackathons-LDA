                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My Inspiration for this application is my Mum. She absolutely loves to travel but tends to lose her luggage.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>       Airberlin Suave is a simplified suite of mechanisms aimed at providing Airberlin passengers with a smooth in-air and on-land experience from their arrival in the airport to their departure from the airport. Mechanisms like Track Your Luggage and Gate are aimed at providing safeguards against non-knowledge of gate position within a vast airport(Gate). It is basically a countdown timer that reminds you every hour of your gatetime and when your gate opens. Luggage is a  mechanism aimed at reducing stress and worry of where an individuals bag may be(Luggage) during the flight after check in. 

                        Other mechanisms like In-Flight Snack, Gaming, Funny Short Stories, Secure Connectivity are more aimed at ensuring that the quality of airplane food increases and airplane companies see a proportional rise in profit and revenue, basically a win-win!(In-Flight Snack), Gaming is self-explanatory and so is Short Stories.

 Also Included are fringe mechanisms like Stressalyssa and Solve a Problem both aimed at diagnosing pressure points in the airport that lead to stressful and un-engaging experiences. Stressalyssa consists of three components : Heart rate monitor, Oxygen Saturation and Record Respiratory rate.  Heart rate monitor uses the camera of an android phone to determine their BPM. Record respiratory rate is a playback mechanism which records your breathing and replays it for you(Not very futuristic i know but doctors posit that slight inflections in breathing patterns could give an idea of other major issues faced by that individual resultant from the stress).

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is built on the android platform with airberlin &amp; xapiix api providing the backend for the application.
I created this app in a colloquial manner to ensure that this model is aimed at reducing stress and ensuring a streamlined experience while in the airport for the business man and the ordinary Joe.This app contains a plethora of mechanisms aimed at providing basic&nbsp; services which create a large amount of crisis in the airport and quick responses to the unexpected crisises that Inevitably pop up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I consciously refused to work on any mechanism I thought you had already perfected, as I downloaded your android app to see what you had.

                <p>
                    This application was a buzzer beater!. i mean it started out well till i realized the limitations some conventional Views in android had and had to improvise to solve the problems i encountered. I only  got done with it right as i am writing this , which is the day before the deadline.
