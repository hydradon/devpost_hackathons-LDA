                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the things that mostly inspired us to work on this idea was the fact there there are a lot of sick children that can't really experience childhood. So by applying this idea into the Hololens we are able to get the students to interact with their MR environment. With this we are able to make sure that these kids are always smiling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea that we are using the Hololens for is a MR environment where the user is able to interact with a book and see different effects when they turn or move a object through the Hololens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity program to go ahead and built the environment that we needed for the Hololens, as well as run Visual Studio to upload the program into the Hololens when needed to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first few hours we ran through a lot of software and system requirements issues. This greatly effected us in planning how and if we were going to accomplish anything at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a few accomplishments like actually being able to have a demo to display for the judges. As well as learning how the Unity program worked since we didn't have any experience at all with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the use of new high-end technology, we learned that we could directly change the lives of people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Disney Experience
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The concept of "The Disney Experience" will hopefully open the eyes of developers open the world of Mixed Reality in a learning environment. Eventually we hope to see a version of "The Disney Experience" in a more educational way.
