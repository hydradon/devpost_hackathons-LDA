                    PROJECT CHECKWRIST
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members recently read a book by the famous neurosurgeon Atul Gawande called The Checklist Manifesto. This book described amazing results from simply applying checklists to medical procedures and preparation, resulting in some clinics dropping preventable accidents by 30% or more. We decided to build a web app that would make this implementation of these life saving checklists easier, smarter and interconnected with a variety of other functionalities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What Our App Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CheckWrist allows for medical personnel to attach smart checklists to patient profiles for real-time tracking and to allow for easy sharing of patient status and current procedure stage information between all types of medical personnel. It combines this functionality with the ability to prioritize patients and filter out information irrelevant to different specialized medical personnel. One of the key benefits is to allow medical personnel to quickly and efficiently share information about patients with relevant personnel, ensuring no steps are missed and time wasted debriefing or finding people to be debriefed about a patient is eliminated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The smart checklists are able to facilitate informed decision making and prevent complications arising from doubling up on steps, forgetting steps, or not performing a checklist item within researched timelines. These smart checklists are also preloaded with all the steps and making the process of going through the checklist as simple as tapping a screen. The checklist also displays critical information such as time restraints associated to a checklist item. The app also has a built in QR code scanner for efficient checking on a patient&rsquo;s status even if unattended and voice recognition for checking off items on a checklist while keeping hands free for other tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CheckWrist also generates a dashboard that centralised patient data for medical professionals. New patients may be admitted to the database, who can then be assigned to doctors according to the condition that must be treated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CheckWrist is a web application built using Vue.js as the frontend, Socket.io, Python Flask and JSON pages as the app&rsquo;s backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the frontend and backend parts of the web app was difficult, as several merge errors had to be solved.
Our experience using GitHub was limited and led to several issues in getting the project to come together. Furthermore, this is the first time anyone has participated in a hackathon and a few have little to no experience with frontend or backend development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments We Are Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Checklists to sync across several devices as well as allowing for easy passing of medical information and checklist progress to different users. Many of the functions are also functional at various degrees, such as real time updates, voice recognition, QR code scanning and the assignation and tracking of patients.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use GitHub properly as well as build a functioning web app that could work across multiple devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What Is On The Roadmap For CheckWrist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many ideas for features that didn&rsquo;t make it into the demo version of CheckWrist. One example of a feature that was not able to be added due to time constraints was clean scaling of the app on small mobile devices. The name CheckWrist arose because the app was intended originally to be placed on a device on a doctor&rsquo;s wrist allowing for quick access and convenience. The app would also need to be loaded with a full listing of checklists used by medical professionals to allow for easy form fill out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Integration into the digital health records database would also allow the app to import patient information to further enhance the decision making enabled by the app. Another feature that was discussed was the addition of in app calling enabled by a connected Bluetooth headset, allowing medical personnel to quickly call each other through the app to query on specific information shown in the app and further improve CheckWrist&rsquo;s all in one app functionality. We also would want the app to use AI to automatically prioritise patients based on the contents of their checklists and the tagged difficulty of the checklist. The AI would also be able to generate insights based on the patient information collected to further improve checklists and patient care. The intended method of securing patient information was to apply a blockchain to secure the patient information and leverage the already shared nature of the patient information to security.
