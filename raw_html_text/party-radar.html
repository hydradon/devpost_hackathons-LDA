                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we are all college students, we agreed that one of the hardest part of it is to meet and get to know new people because of that we decided to develop this webpage
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a website that will help people expand their social network, make new friends, and have fun
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    for development we used HTML to program the page, Java Script to implement the google maps api, SSC to style the web page and Ruby to put everything together and make the connection with the data bases. The project has one data base with two tables, one that saves the usernames, passwords and age, and another one that saves the hosts parties and events, this one saves location, max number of attendees, age restriction and comments made by the host to inform the attendees about specific information about the party or event
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    . During the construction of this project we encountered many difficulties, as how to implement all the languages together, also since we were working apart while coding it was difficult because ideas got mixed up
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel proud since this was the first hackaton for most of or team, and we got to developed something from scratch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we got to learn more about API's and how they work, also we learn how different languages can come together and become a grate project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Party Radar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    if we got more time we would implemented in real life, for us this seems a very real and tangible project that can become a reality.
