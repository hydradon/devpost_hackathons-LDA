                    I've always been fascinated by the onset of Machine Learning. Recently, I've been learning machine learning and wanted to build a machine learning project of my own.

                    It basically takes country name and year as input and then predicts the population of that country in that particular given year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built this linear regression model using python and hosted the server using flask server and front end is HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Implementing algorithm with no extra inbuilt libraries was one of the challenges that I faced along with designing a perfect UI for this project. Due to the time constraint, I could only overcome first challenge and the best UI for this project is still pending.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm particularly proud of this project more than my other projects because this is my first ML project that I implemented on my onw.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learnt ML and linear regression algorithms such as gradient descent which I've also used here in this project. I also learnt about flask servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Future enhancement include the best UI for this project. I've planned to use Google Maps API to fetch location using Maps at real-time or just hit a location with its latitude and longitude coordinates and predict the population using a window on the map.
