                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A long-term struggle in the chronic wound industry has been finding a proper measurement system. Doctors currently still use rulers to gather length x width measurements, which is often wildly inaccurate. Often, patients cannot even tell if their wound is healing or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    InstaMed gathers chronic wound measurements from a simple smartphone picture. It stores past images and wound dimension data so users can view history and track their growth over time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized android studio in conjunction with OpenCV open source libraries to build the mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A struggle within the project was incorporating OpenCV into the app. There were a lot of different dependencies and settings we had to take care of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of creating a functional application with accurate measurement data. The application gives strong results when tested against shapes of known sizes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create an OpenCV android application, as well as many other features with RecyclerView and graphs in android development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for InstaMed
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming next, we hope to have a user log-in page and a database which would store all user information. Further accuracy tests should be conducted to further improve the measurement algorithm.
