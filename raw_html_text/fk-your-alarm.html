                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our roommates doesn't wake up for his alarm. It's getting kind of cold outside, so we don't want to leave our beds and go turn it off. He doesn't even plan on going to class, so why does he even set the alarm in the first place?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When an alarm goes off on one phone, another phone can turn that alarm off (or on again).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interface was with Android studio, and "connecting" the devices was done using firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ringtone selector returns a random ringtone, so you can't really set it.
The person who sets the alarm can't turn the alarm off on his on phone.
Originally tried to use bluetooth, but ended up using firebase.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interface looks ok, and none of us have used android studio before, so we are pretty proud of that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Intents are extremely useful for conveying information. Firebase is very useful for instant communication + easy setup time.
                </p>

                    What's next for Fk Your Alarm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Probably visual improvements, keeping track of the alarms, being able to turn the alarm off on your on phone, advertisements (?).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Need android studio to run it on your phone.
