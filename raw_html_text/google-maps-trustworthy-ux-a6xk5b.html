                    The challenge of the hackathon was to design a trustworthy AI intervention. It was interesting to explore what it means for AI to be trustworthy. While we might not have arrived at a final product that would defeat the "uncanny valley" in which imperfect human likeness proves human dislike and we might not even have passed Microsoft's 6 principles of trustworthiness for AI, but we did learn a lot.

                    Urbanization, concrete, and structure have given birth to a large network of roads- everywhere, evolving in numbers and need by the day.  Map applications like OSM and Google Maps have made navigation easier and we see new improvements every now and then. However, we felt that a more contextual approach with the help of AI could make the driving experience better, but also safer and more accurate.

                    We took the cases in the Indian context such as potholes, road blockages due to marriages and politicians and due to poorly designed drainage systems of the roads, which sadly is going to take a long time to defeat, considering factors like corruption and designed a feature called "Alert mode" that can be part of these map applications.

                    Alert mode aims to help people traveling to unfamiliar spaces gain better control and independence in their journey through places they are traveling to which are new to them. The Alert mode uses data crowdsourced from other travelers, radio stations, weather reports, and local news reports to generate important intimations that the traveler might need to know before traveling through an unfamiliar territory.

                    We designed the UI, the method of information delivery, etc to make the AI more trustworthy.
