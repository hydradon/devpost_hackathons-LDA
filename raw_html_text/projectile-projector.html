                <p>
                    We were inspired by our fascination in learning Unity and utilizing C#, cultivating our skills in Vector3, dot operations, and accessing object's properties

                <p>
                    Simulates a cannon that shoots a projectile in the air given a mass, initial velocity, and initial height, and returns the time until landing, distance traveled, and angle shot at.
