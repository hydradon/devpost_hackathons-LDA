                    We first hand experience at what its like to be unable to cook and struggling to find a meal. Eventually we usually ended up eating out or simply going to sleep hungry. Our app allows students to enter the ingredients they have at their disposals in order to help decide what kind of sandwich they could make. A sandwich is extremely versatile and cost efficient, this is why we chose this platform. The purpose of this app is to allow college students to be more independent, healthy and maybe even save a little money.
