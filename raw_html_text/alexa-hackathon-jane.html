                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like the idea of users being able to purchase their boutique desires over a VUI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa will ask Jane for a user's top number of deals, and offer to tell them more about a deal in that result set.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with .NET Core, Azure, and of course, Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It runs out that Alexa's not designed to handle dictation, so we had to change our initial design that allowed a user to ask more about a deal by name, to a numerical representation of that deal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did a lot in a short period of time.  We even got continuous deployment up and running within a few minutes of starting - that really helped out when testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that Alexa is a powerful platform!  It's very easy to interface with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Alexa Hackathon (Jane)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll probably talk to our product people, and see if they find any value in eventually maturing a VUI for Jane.
                </p>
