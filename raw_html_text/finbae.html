                    Our team was new to the cloud environment, we struggled to make MongoDB work on cloud.  It was difficult to interface the backend and frontend, in the beginning, we struggled in getting desired results, understand the platform and creating a model.

                    We are so proud of the whole project itself. We were able to fit all the pieces together and create a working MVP.  We even did a potential customer survey and were fascinated by the fact, that it would cater a huge userbase. Given the diversified skillset in our team, we enjoyed it a lot.
