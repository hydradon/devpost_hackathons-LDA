                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was to help people who are blind, to be able to discretely gather context during social interactions and general day-to-day activities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The glasses take a picture and analyze them using Microsoft, Google, and IBM Watson's Vision Recognition APIs and try to understand what is happening. They then form a sentence and let the user know. There's also a neural network at play that discerns between the two dens and can tell who is in the frame
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took a RPi Camera and increased the length of the cable. We then made a hole in our lens of the glasses and fit it in there. We added a touch sensor to discretely control the camera as well.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was Natural Language Processing, as in trying to parse together a human-sounding sentence that describes the scene.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt a lot about the different vision APIs out there and creating/trainingyour own Neural Network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Let Me See
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to further improve our analysis and reduce our analyzing time.
