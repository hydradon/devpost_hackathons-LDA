                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    When we were deciding what to do, we wanted to create a Telegram bot and got inspiration from our dear friend Francis, who is a fairly
                    <strong>
                        annoying
                    </strong>
                    person but does not like the use of uncouth language. Hence, we created a Telegram bot as an attempt to replicate his behaviour.

                    <li>
                        Prompts you not to use uncouth language when a word in the banned list is used
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A random word will be added to the banned list everyday
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users can redeem themselves by refraining from using banned words over a number of messages sent
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The use of certain words will prompt the bot to send related song lyrics
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Randomly decides to remind chat users of the number of days until finals (what a kill joy)

                    <li>
                        Users will get kicked out the chat with a chance proportional to their banned words count

                        /naughtyList: Leaderboard to show the number of banned words used for the top 10 users

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and Telegram Bot API for Python to complete this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially decided to use node js to code the bot but later decided to use Python instead as it was a slightly more familiar language. We also had other features that we had to cut because they were not as relevant to our bot even though we spent quite a lot of time implementing them.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have created a bot that closely replicates Francis'

                    behaviour in an online setting so it feels like he is always with us at all times.
