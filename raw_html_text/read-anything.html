                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever had a professor that just writes notes on the white board too fast for you to catch up to ? Find yourself taking pictures of the white board but never writing the notes down, or did something come up and you accidentally missed class and now you have to ask a friend for notes, but will you ever take those pictures and actually write your notes down on paper ? Want to practice reading old historic documents but cant find one thats readable ? Tired of Manga taking months to release English translation ? Got an image thats in another language and your curious to see what it says !
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes an image url, depending on whats on the image it can translate the text from any language to english. If the image consist of handwritten text it will output the handwritten text.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the case of reading handwritten text,  recognition is a async op, that takes a few more seconds to process. Format json data. Parsing.
