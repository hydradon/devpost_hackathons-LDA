                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of domino's boxes and redbull cans lying around and needed to clear some space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows the user to make sweet sweet music simply by moving his discarded dominos box from the night before up and down.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An Ultrasound sensor measures the height of a dominos box which is then converted into the corresponding frequency using a magic formula coded into the Micro:Bit, then the sound is finally outputted through a speaker using PWM.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Too many to fit into this text box. Here are just a couple of them:
-Ultrasonic sensor only working with C++, micro:bit music library only available in microPython
-solved by transmitting frequency from a micro:bit running C++ to another micro:bit running micropython which then outputs the sound
-radio transmission to slow (sound lags too heavily), hence  we are now using one micro:bit utilising manual PWM programming in C++
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Be creative with the limited resources available
-24 hours isn't as long as you think
-Not every day is Wednesday (my dudes)
