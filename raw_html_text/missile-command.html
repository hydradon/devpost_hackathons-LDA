                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea was to rekindle the childhood joy of arcade games by replicating the handheld gaming experience in a unique and innovative way. We decided to recreate our take on Missile Command with ESP's as it provided a challenge and opportunity to learn something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ESP's communicate over wifi with one attacking as an "attacker" and firing missiles at the other player, the "defender." Graphics for the game are animated on a 0.96 in. OLED screen using the Adafruit GPX engine.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built on grit and determination inside of the Arduino IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult aspect of the project was making the two ESP's communicate with each other, and finding a way to pass packets of data back and forth quickly enough to support a real-time game. We overcame this issue by implementing efficient systems of pointers and checks, as well as digging deep through documentation to find the correct functions.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of the ability to make two ESP's talk to each other in real-time, interpret that data, and present it in a graphical format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the ESP wifi capabilities, weakness and strengths. We also used GitHub heavily for version control and tracking changes between all team members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Missile Command
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Missile Command will soon be updated with more features, potentially involving a larger screen for enhanced graphics, support for more than two players, implementing better analog control, and even adding audio feedback.
