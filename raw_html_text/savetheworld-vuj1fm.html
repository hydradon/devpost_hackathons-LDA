                    What it does

                <p>
                    its an Android app, 
the idea is that you would login with your facebook account,
all your friends would be transferred into the app,
then your 'feed' would be a live feed of current national disasters and food/water drives etc.
from there you would be able to click a like and be taken to a page if wanted to donate to any particular cause,
you would be able to see how many of your friends donated to each 'disaster' charities/initiative,
however you wouldn't be able to see the amount they donated (unless they want to share it)
