                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BearFinder started out as a simple idea during CalHacks: helping people find a study group. Our team members each added their own individual perspectives to this idea--for one, finding a study group is finding a group of friends who you can not only study with, but also hang out with; for another, having an online introduction protects from the social anxiety associated with the less controlled in person introductions; for another, the ability to filter study partners by native tongue bridges a language barrier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BearFinder allows students to connect with people that match them and their study habits. Search for people to work with based on common languages, previously taken courses, expected time spent studying, major, interests, and much more! We want to see students succeed in school, and part of that is finding a good group dynamic.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though CalHacks is the first hackathon for all our members, the dynamics of our team suffered from differences in experiance and skill level. This put a lot of pressure on the one person who had more experiance and left the others with less experiance to figure out the basics of making a website prettier looking from scratch. Since one person in our group had knowledge of services and back-end systems, he had to be patient and teach us some basics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Somethings work! We were hacking for all 3 days! 
We started out with just an idea, but no idea of how to implement it. Each of team members had to contribute their skills and learn new ones if needed. Also, this was the first hackathon for all of the team members, so we are proud to have built something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We each learned some different things, including things about ourselves, database schema design, webdesign, new languages, etc.
                </p>
