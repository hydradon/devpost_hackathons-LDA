                    We were inspired to make our project when we attended the Intro to Unity Game Development workshop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our game "Space Adventures" is a short game where you help the Womxn/Hacks mascot get through space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and Visual Studios to create this project. Because C# is very similar to Java, it was easy for us to follow along.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At one point, Unity crashed and we lost our 5 hours of progress, because we thought it was saving every time we ran it. Thankfully, we were able to finish it in a little over 2 hours because we had an easier time doing what we needed to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was very exciting to learn about game development and implement it into our project. It was fun to learn how to use Unity, and learn about what the different settings do and what kind of skins/textures we can use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future, we want to create more levels, and add more effects and animation. Overall, Womxn/Hacks was an amazing experience and a great event to attend as our first hack-a-thon.
