                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we think of social good we want to include people in different situations helping each other. It can be difficult for lower income families to find free resources they need to survive, especially in our cold winters. We don&rsquo;t know of any centralized hubs that provide resources for all survival needs. We hope to make it easier for anyone who needs help.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Website map interface that tells the user of local necessities around their community (ie, food). A way for communities to come together and provide resources to lower income community members. Website interface was chosen so that it does not require a phone to access (ie a public library computer would suffice), but could easily be expanded to an app

                            Parsing an XML file using HTML/Javascript. Our scripts cannot make connection with the XML file (Cross-Origin request error) because the connection was unsecure. We spent a lot of time trying out the COR request method, and hosting the program through a server.
