                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pokemon Go and the mental/physical health it promoted due to getting people outdoors and exercising/socializing with other.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facilitates group activity by monitoring the location of people around you and helping create gameplay that a certain subgroup you specified can participate in.  The focus group would be organizations, clubs, jobs, etc. that are looking for a way to bond/improve the morale of its members.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a AWS server to build a restful python server to run the back-end of our application.  The front-end of application was constructed in Unity3D using C# and HTTP requests to the AWS server.  We utilized the Google Maps Unity Asset to render the map of the current user's location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tried to use arcGIS to render our map, but the API is best used in a web setting.  Tried to download all of the ArcGIS API, but they were not Mac-compatible or UnityScript-compatible.
Two of three members have limited experience using Unity3D, therefore there was a big learning curve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rendering the accurate map from Google Maps and building the prototype on an iPhone.  The iPhone was even able to measure the changes in GPS location to move the avatar on the screen.
                    <br>
                    Successfully created an HTTP server to handle GET/POST requests.
Built a tile management system in Unity to interact with Google Maps API for potential scalability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity development, GPS location, App development, communication with an HTTP server
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WeGo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ability to send the GPS coordinates from different users to the same server and have the WeGo app generate icons for everyone in the local area.  Have those icons move and update depending on the movement of the world around the user, and create interactions where the user can join/leave games being played around them.  Dynamic tile loading so the map continuously updates as you move around with limited memory usage.
