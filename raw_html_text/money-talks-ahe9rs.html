                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A major issue we face in society is the accumulation of debt. We set out to create a new and original way to present data. We wanted to convey to our users the seriousness of this problem in a memorable way. We designed our hack to use distinct visual and auditory cues that catch the eye and ear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Money Talks is a musical visualization of bills gathered from a database. It plays procedurally generated music that depicts bills that have been paid and are yet to be paid. Users can customize a multitude of parameters from music instrument to background environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tackled different workloads individually. Greg handled working with Unity and expressing data visually. He built the framework for matching sound to graphics. He used Blender to create 3D models of integers and Photoshop to create the interface. He read from our created data set using C# to allow everything to run through a single program in real-time. Cyrus worked on creating and parsing randomized data using Capital One's API. He used Python to familiarize himself with the different APIs and create the randomized data. He used Audiotool to create different sound bytes and integrated them into the application using C# and Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of difficulty striking a balance between the positives and negatives of financial data. One one hand, it feels good to have bills paid off. On the other, it can be very scary to have costs pile up. We needed to create auditory and visual components that complement each other and portray the entire spectrum of both emotions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we started just 24 hours prior to submission, we had little knowledge of both the Capital One and Restful API's. We progressed quickly, and even managed to crash Capital One's server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became intimate with the experience of coming up with and implementing a creative idea. We improved our ability to coordinate workloads as a team and not sleep for a full 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Money Talks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to extend our application to take advantage of all different kinds of data. We set our project up so that it is easily generalizable to any database. We also want to add more instruments and improve the audial and visual effects.
