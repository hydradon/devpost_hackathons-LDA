                    This is our project, LAG++.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LAG++ is a fully functional turing-complete lightweight programming language designed fully for beginners. It incorporates a fully fledged editor as well as extensively detailed documentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LAG++ has a full suite of functions and statements, including if/else conditionals, for/while loops, and the usability of all real numbers, strings, booleans, and lists. LAG++ implements its own ability to automatically evaluate expressions, and in addition the language also contains the basic framework to make interactive graphical interfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LAG++&rsquo;s architecture is built off of Python 3. We hope any and all reviewers of our project find it to their satisfaction.
