                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our friend Gavin came up with the idea, to be able to order glasses online without having to use body-measurment tape to try and find the distance between your two pupils.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using opencv.Js, we used facial recognition and edge detection to reference a credit card to then find the measurements from the users Webcam to digitally map the purple distance and automatically updating the order profile for the user.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Error checking, when creating multiple canvas's for edge detection concerning the detection of the credit Card was very tricky to get around.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Solving the issue and creating a working part, showing the canny lines for the edge detection.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To be more proficient in Javascript programming and learning to become a better programmer under pressure.

                <p>
                    To fully have a working product and see a functioning model being used in the field.
