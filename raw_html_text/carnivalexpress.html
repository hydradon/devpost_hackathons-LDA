                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired but how advanced Alexa has become in the past and it allows you to just throw commands at her when you need it. As past experiences in cruises, we thought it would be cool to have a personal assistant allowing you to order and know wait times right in your room.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build an Alexa app that will allow for every Echo dot in the guest's room to have access to concierge and it will read out the menu and take your order right in your room. Not only that but it will also allows the user to request wait times for events such as bars, spas, cinemas, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created new skills along with java Alexa skill skit to enable Alexa to receive command and deliver correct output.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us were either new or had the minimal amount of experience with developing skills for Alexa, we had to do a lot of research and videos on how to get our idea to live.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all contributed to the project and came in consensus with our idea. Also got to learn a new skill.
                </p>
                <h2>
