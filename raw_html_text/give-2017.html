                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Katie (Katherine) and Eric has always wanted to create something that helps the greater good, and this app achieves that purpose. We decided to incorporate swiping because it makes it easier and faster to donate, and this day and age, users want easier interfaces to interact with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app makes it easier to donate to charities. Users swipe right to donate, swipe left to move to the next charity, and click on the image to read a blurb about the charity. There is also links to the charity's website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Katie worked on the front end and used HTML, CSS, and JS. Semantic-ui and Hammer.min.js were very helpful in finishing the front end. Eric worked on the back end and used JS, MongoDB, and Express.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Katie faced many frontend challenges: implementing swiping and managing interactions between HTML5 and JS. While Katie was able to finish the front end, Eric was unable to connect the backend with the frontend. The back-end was particularly difficult because neither of us had prior experience. Eric faced many challenges: npm installation, communicating with the MongoDB server, trying to incorporate Mongopop with MongoDB, building a REST web app, and using Express to modify the MongoDB cluster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Katie finished the front end and added additional bits and pieces that were not originally planned. Also, we learned a great deal about back-end interactions. Eric was able to build a simple REST web app that allows the admin to input user's information and store it into a MongoDB cluster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both expanded our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS, and both of us gained knowledge about databases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Give 2017
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to be able to finish the back-end interactions. Also, the original plan was to also incorporate a monthly raffle for users, as an incentive for them to donate. We would like to incorporate this in the future after we complete the back-end.
