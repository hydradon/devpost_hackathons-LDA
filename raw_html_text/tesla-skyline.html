                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just thought it would be nice to build a car that could run
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It should be driving, and we have a stepper motor on top, which could have had a sensor that made it avoid driving into walls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly with Lego Mindstorm blocks, and some self-made electrical cables and components
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We needed a gearbox because of the components available, so that made us unable to turn the car the way we wanted. So we needed a new way to turn. Which made us rebuild the entire back of the car. 
Also we had problems with our electrical components and with our servo motors of which one stopped working
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the car and it actually ran
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Think twice
It's a good idea to have a planned finished design before you start building to avoid mistakes
How a car turns and why it is a good idea to have an inner set of gears
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tesla Skyline
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will transport Elon Musk over the martian plane.
