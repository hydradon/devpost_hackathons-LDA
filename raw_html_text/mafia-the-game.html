                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make Mafia much more accessible to more people.
Lobby system inspired by COD.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Web Game replaces the need for cards.  In this day and age, everyone has a cellphone so this game would be easily accessible to anyone who wants a fun game to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially thought of a real-life game that could be converted into a game on the internet, and Mafia was perfect for this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several issues with the database because none of us were experienced in MySQL
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get the game lobby system working perfectly.
In addition, we figured out how to use MySQL to meet our needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a game is a lot harder than we initially thought, especially with limited experience in programming.
                </p>

                    What's next for Mafia: The Game
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on adding many new features, improving the graphics and user interface, and lastly, we plan on improving the performance of the site.
