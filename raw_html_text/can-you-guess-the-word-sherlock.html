                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The best way to learn something is if the material is presented in a fun and engaging manner, and yet school seems to make every possible effort to make learning stressful and boring through endless tests and needless difficult homeworks. This is my attempt to restore the balance a bit, my app is a fun way to learn new words!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides clues about the word to the learner who needs to guess the correct word. Multiple clues of varying difficulties are incorporated so that the game is challenging while also ensuring that the user has a good chance of guessing the word.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Oxford dictionary API to generate clues regarding some pre-chosen words. The entire game runs on the client with all the API calls and program logic implemented in javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dictionary definitions don't seem to make guess the word very easy, so I had to find ways to make the game easier while still ensuring that it remained challenging.
I arrived very late, so I missed the team building activities at the start. Since everybody already seemed to have found a team, I decided to participate as a solo-hacker which meant that I had to do all of the tasks on my own!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game took a lot of work since I was working on it by myself, but thanks to the mentors and stackoverflow, I was able to make a fun webapp which also encourages learning!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working completely by myself has disadvantages, but there are also several benefits. I particularly enjoyed the autonomy I had while working on this project.
                </p>

                    What's next for Can you guess the word, Sherlock?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of work to do before the app can reach others, the ui could use some work and the code can be more DRY and modular. All I have right now is a working prototype.
