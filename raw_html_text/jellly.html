                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from a group member's brother, who has trouble with learning. Despite the wide range of learning tools available, such as Khan Academy, few of these are for young students. As the brother is an 8 year old, we decided to make this learning app for young students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This learning app is designed for students in K-5. It tests them in areas of math and asks them questions to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to make the code, and split the work among the group members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most time consuming challenge was getting everyone to download Android Studio and set it up. Without the correct configuration, combining the code would be even more difficult. Another challenge we ran into was our limited knowledge and time, so we were forced to make the app as simple as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to complete the code with our limited knowledge. We are also proud of our teamworking skills, because otherwise we could not have finished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that sometimes, simplicity is best. We also learned the importance of teamwork and dividing the load.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Jellly
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on making Jellly more advanced by adding more questions, including topics in Science and History and English. In this way, we hope to make a simple yet easy to use learning app that students of all grades can use.
