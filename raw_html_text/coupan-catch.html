                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone loves exploring new places. But the cost is something that stops us from fulfilling our wanderlust. So, we decided to do something to make it a little achievable along with giving them insights about the place. We are trying to create a perfect blend of advertisement with enriched travel experiences.

                    What it does -
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea aims at enhancing travel experience for families, friends and ourselves along with promoting local brands and shops of the area who can not spend money on advertisement.
Based upon your travel dates and place, we suggest you the "must visit places", local restaurants to have good food and best activities to enjoy of your choice at a cheaper price. All you need is to play a small quiz game and win exciting coupons.
