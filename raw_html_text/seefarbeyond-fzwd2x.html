                    We were inspired by the growing field of computer vision and machine learning in general, which we all have an interest in. We learned a lot about cloud programming and nodejs in general, but we all came in with unique sets of skills and were able to pass on information to one another. We faced a lot of challenges, especially when pretty far into the project, we learned the limitations of the Google Computer Vision APIs and faced major set backs in trying to get our nodejs to function in the absence of a dedicated web server.
