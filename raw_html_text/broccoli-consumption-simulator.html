                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The glaring problem with our society is that we don't consume enough broccoli. We set out to change that with an innovative piece of software that will literally change the fabric of our society to the core and increase the power of Big Broccoli in our day to day lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project takes the viewer on an interactive experience that encourages increased healthy eating habits by allowing the viewer -- who eats broccoli in real life -- to then digitize that experience for in-game rewards including satisfying gameplay and a lush visual world where the viewer gets immersed in the world and doesn't want to leave the story or lore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python and Pygame to create the groundwork for this piece. We used Photoshop to create the game's mascot, Broccoli Consumption Man. We used many files to make this game, and we think that's quite an achievement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were distracted for the first 15 hours of the Hackathon, but pulled together as a team after that to make this project work. It was -- to be fair -- nothing short of a miracle that we made it this far in this short a time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used many files to make this game and we think that's quite an achievement. We are proud that the first game we made is going to revolutionize the world. Additionally, we're also proud of the lore in the game, which is at least as deep as the lore seen in the Elder Scrolls franchise.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We improved our Python and Pygame skills. We also learned necessary skills as CS majors that in some form will help us along the line.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Broccoli Consumption Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Depending on how today's presentation goes, we may have an IPO in the near future. We plan on making even more content for the game to further appease our fan base. Thank you for your support.
