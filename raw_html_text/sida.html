                    Imagine you are a startup company or a non-profit organization. You might want to advertise what your company does, or provide online  resources to your fundraiser, but don't have the money to pay a hosting company for a website, and don't have the knowledge to create your own. With our device, you can host a website anywhere with just a few clicks. The Sida Plug and Play Web Server simplifies and automates web development. On starting the machine up, users can select their server architecture from a list of templates.  Some of the options that can be available include a MEAN Stack and a LAMP Stack. Then, they can choose what they want their website to look like from a list of Bootstrap Web Templates. After selecting these two options, they type in the domain name they want and click "Go Live". The Machine will set up the desired templates and then host the website publicly on the internet.
