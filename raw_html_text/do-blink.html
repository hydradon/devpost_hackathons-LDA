                <p>
                    The rate of myopia is drastically increasing worldwide with up to half of the word's population expected to be myopic by 2050. Myopia is a significant risk factor in vision-threatening diseases.
One leading cause of increased myopic rate is the increase in digital screen time and lack of eye care knowledge. Simple activities such as taking a break, or blinking more regularly can greatly reduce eye strain, helping to preserve eye health.
