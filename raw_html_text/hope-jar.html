                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prioritization of law over justice in the criminal courts makes us sad/angry so we just wanna fight the system :) 
We are also inspired by "...idea that love, only love, could heal our brokenness" - F. Scott Fitzgerald

                    The Hope J(ustice)A(nd)R(eform) is a project that seeks to provide ex-convicts a means of restarting their life after finishing their prison sentence. It allows them to finish a certification/module that certifies that they have reformed and have the qualifications to work for employers. The website gives employers a place to post jobs and ex-convicts a place to post their job profiles. The project is also a means of educating the public on prison reform movements so that other people can make a difference as well. Our mission is to make a positive impact on the ex-convicts' life and give them a second change to make change.
