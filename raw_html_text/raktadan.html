                    I was talking to one of my acquaintances one day when she told me a story from her past about how she had to gather courage gathering blood on a day when one of her loved ones was on the surgery table, when I thought about this platform which could connect hospitals to blood donors during an emergency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our platform lets blood donors register on our platform and gives them updates about the necessity of blood during an emergency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built the platform using react for front-end and firebase for the back-end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coming up with a working decoupled platform that won't put a lot of load on the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coming up with the big picture of the entire platform is very important, before one actually starts developing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try making it a uniform platform across a country.
