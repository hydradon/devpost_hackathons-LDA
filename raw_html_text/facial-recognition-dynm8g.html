                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the disorganization of students who use school planners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a custom schedule for each student based on their classes and their sleep schedule. It also incorporates a facial recognition aspect that could be used to sign students into the program in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded the entire program from scratch. The facial recognition is powered by OpenCV and Python, while the planner was coded in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were especially challenged by the aspect of combining the code together from one computer to the next. These caused last-minute errors in our code that were difficult to resolve.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of creating a schedule based on user input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the language of Java and we learned about complex array techniques used to store the classes. We also learned about how to develop a face detection program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hacknerds
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to further develop the planner to be able to display a calendar for the user. We would also like the sleep schedule to be displayed in a graph for the user. Improving the Facial Recognition and training it further in order for it to be secure enough to unlock a schedule.
