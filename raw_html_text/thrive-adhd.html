                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration comes from my struggle with ADHD. I was diagnosed as an adult. I had no idea how to manage myself and where to find help. After seeking treatment for years, I started advocating the importance of mental health to young people. People often ask me, "where can I find more information about this disorder?" As a teacher, parents asked me for more information on ADHD. This propelled my team and I to create Thrive, a safe space for people with ADHD can find resources, connect with other people living with ADHD and ask for advice/help.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thrive gives people living with ADHD a community to find and share resources and connect with others who have ADHD.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    We built this community on the messenger platform. Our server is hosted on heroku and connected to a MongoDB database. We created a facebook page where members can post information and submit answers to members seeking help.
