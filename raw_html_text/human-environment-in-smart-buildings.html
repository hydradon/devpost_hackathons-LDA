                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by new wearable low-energy sensors and smart building environments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main idea was to connect and include into common control loop for improving environment and human behavior two different data sources: wearable heath/fitness sensors and fixed smart house devices for better quality of live.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By taking into account medical metrics like pulse, breathing frequency, MET metering and so on we achieve better understanding how environment can be tuned up to fit our individual activity and behaviors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As an example one can consider reducing ventilation air flow for helping get sleepy by increasing CO2 ppm rate rather then taking drugs against insomnia.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I proved conceptual possibility for getting together different by their nature data and formulate some use cases for development
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New hardware devices and software protocols.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Human environment in smart buildings.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I do believe that we can control only measurable things so one can not ignore any possibility for measures for better understanding how  actually people feel and behave in the environments created for them. Wearable devices improving their actuality and data accuracy and using it looks looks very promising for adjusting and improving environment control.
