                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meeting people with similar interests that we enjoy spending time with is incredibly difficult. When it comes to finding friends you can hang out with, to join you on your favorite board game, or do some competitive beach volleyball, tech doesn't offer much help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pool brings people nearby together who share common interests. Want to start a game of volleyball, but don't have anyone to go with? Make a post on Pool. People who are nearby will see you want to play, and will be able to message you through Messenger and grab a Lyft to where you are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pool is built using Expo.io, which brings together a great set of libraries and deployment tools with React Native and allows us to deploy on both Android and iOS. On the backend, NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB work together to provide a REST API to persist our data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was not a single piece of technology used in our stack that any of us had used before MHacks. We were all new to MongoDB, React Native, NodeJS, and JavaScript in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How effectively we worked together as a team. None of us knew each other before we arrived on North Campus, but we all shared a love for the idea and a cohesiveness that made us incredibly productive.
