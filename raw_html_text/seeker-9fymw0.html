                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recently me and my friends went overseas on a trip, it was very fun and we wanted to go somewhere else again. However all the research and time it took to find the cost of plane tickets, hotels, food, and transportation was an annoying experience. Trying to convince friends of the cost which fluctuates from time to time was also very annoying. So we wondered why there isn't a website that just collates all the data onto it in a nice and simple to read format? That was where Seeker was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website uses different APIs from different companies such as sky scanner to determine the prices of plane tickets, hotels, food and even the renting of cars and puts them all in a neat format on a website for all to view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The site will match places to go depending on the location you input and the budget range that you selected. When you have inputted all the information, the web app will show places to go according to price (lowest to highest). This price is a combination of tickets, food, accommodations, and transport. When a country has been clicked, it will show you other information regarding the country as well such as the language used, the exchange rate (from your currency) as well as the current weather of the country and much more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used VSCode as the IDE and html, CSS, Javascript to make the website, and integrated Skyscanner API into it to display the different prices from each category. Used weather.com for the weather forecasts, Figma to design a high-fidelity wireframe prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No one in the group has any experience with APIs and integrating them on websites. and it has been a while since anyone in the group has touched HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to learn about APIs and actually use it for a project, all in 24hrs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the pros of using APIs and how they can be extremely helpful in saving time when creating web apps in a short amount of time as well as how to integrate APIs into HTML code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Seeker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make personal profiles for the user and a ranking system on which countries to visit, as well as collaborations with local restaurants to promote the local delicacies of the country. Some backpacking tips and guides to travel the world on a budget and multi-destination cost. We feel that there are many improvements and ideas yet to be uncovered from this idea and will continue to work on it in the future even after the hackathon.
