                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got fed up with queuing at Fusion bar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates a virtual queue so that you don't have to queue anymore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ruby, Sinatra and Xcode for the app functionality. And Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to develop the Ui and make it look pretty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time constraints. Period. Although the app slides created on Photoshop were made under an iPhone 6 templates, they couldn't fit quite right on Xcode. So basically, we had a lot of code, a lot of pretty app slides. But it couldn't work quite right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My teammate and I came from different technical backgrounds, but still managed to work well together despite not having a single clue how each other's software worked. We learnt a lot about each other's skills, and would feel more confident to work together in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to translate app design into functionality. How to make beer look cool on Illustrator. How to keep really, really calm and have a lot of fun.
                </p>

                    What's next for EnQ

                <p>
                    Order your food and drinks through the app, then world domination.
