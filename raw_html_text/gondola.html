                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two popular games, Smash Hit and Beat Saber, were the fundamental inspiration points for this game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game puts you onto a virtual gondola on rails, and hurls you through five levels of fun, exhilarating action.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Unity and SteamVR for the development of this project, as their built in tools and models expedited our development process given our time constraint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest issue we ran into was the learning curve of picking up how to develop on Unity. We were all foreign to the development environment, so that and the bugs that naturally show up in any development process were the most notable challenges.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we only had 36 hours to develop this game, we built it to the point where we feel we can release it to the public given some more polishing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many things about Unity and how it works, and how game development as a whole works. Learning how the internal components of everything that shows up in the game meshes together was also a great experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gondola
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now comes the process of refinement. We would like to make new game modes and add more levels. We would also like to add more items like different types of bows, arrows, objects that can be thrown, etc.
