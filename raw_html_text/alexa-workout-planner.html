                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I get more out of my workouts when I plan my workout at the gym, but it's a hassle to bring a notebook with me.  Given that Alexa helps me out with building shopping lists, I thought that this was a similar activity - and that I could build a custom Alexa skill that uses the same patterns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides information on different exercises to do at the gym and them help me plan out my workout. While I can't take my Alexa to the gym with me, this skill creates a list in the companion app that I can bring with me and track each exercise I should do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here's the architecture.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Built the skill in node.js, and I started with the Alexa template Amazon provides that can read the shopping list.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I haven't used the API's that can manage lists, so needed to do some research on how this works.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There aren't many custom skills that I could find that use the custom lists, so this could be a good reference for others that are trying to take advantage of this feature. It's great as you don't need to have a standalone app for your phone, and all of the data is managed by Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the new dialog manager within Alexa to simplify the coding. Here's the add exercise intent that shows how multiple slots can be sequenced for data.

                <p>
                    I will monitor how people use it, and continue to make enhancements to make it even better. Potentially there are more time saving features I can add in planning, like coping prior workouts.
