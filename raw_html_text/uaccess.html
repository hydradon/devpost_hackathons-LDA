                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the JPMorgan Code for Good Challenge, which tasked developers to create a web app or service that incentives companies to make their buildings more accessible to people with disabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website serves as a community where business owners can all come together to post about their establishments and what kind of options they have for disabled persons. By making an app like this is it not only incentivizes business owners to implement more accessible options but it brings the community together by allowing those with disabilities to explore the possibilities around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Visual Studio Code and we used JavaScript and our main language. We had Node.js as our front-end and MongoDB as our back-end. We tied these two things together using Express.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a lot of challenges. This was our first exposure to doing full-stack development like this and using these technologies so we had to learn as we went. We had a lot of problems installing the software and packages. In total it probably took more time to debug than to actually plan and code the project but this was a learning experience for both of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to make something that is actually usable. There are a lot of things about this that we could improve but we made a lot of progress despite all the obstacles that we had to overcome. The learning curve for this full-stack software was definitely immense but we were glad we learned something.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From this, we were able to learn some front-end and back-end frameworks and how to tie them together. We learned a lot of cool technologies and about the process of building a web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UAccess
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Following this Hackathon we hope to continue to improve our skills and improve UAccess. The next time we come to a Hackathon we can hopefully hit the ground running and avoid the tedious learning process at the beginning and get right into coding!
