                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    YAM stands for You and Me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When founding YAM, the founders Zachary and Kushal saw in our communities a vast amount of social anxiety teenagers faced when tasked with making "friends". They often wondered when meeting new people if they shared similarities and accept them for who they were. That is why YAM was founded in order to help squash those fears when making new friends. We hoped that by developing a website that would allow people to be more interactive with other strangers with common hobbies it would help people expand their social circle. Ultimately we hope YAM will be used by lots of tons of people who may want a new friend and expand many social circles across the world.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    YAM allows the user to meet new people through the comforts of their home and matches them with people of similar hobbies and interests as themselves. This ultimately will result in people who have similarities which is key to having an effective relationship. If there is a good match between two in YAM they can proceed to meet each other in real life, and YAM matches people based on their location. Ultimately, YAM helps spur meaningful relationships that could last a lifetime.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built primarily with HTML + Javascript. First off the website which is hosted by domain.com is our main server when users are able to navigate throughout the website. The login for the website was utilized using Google cloud firebase in order to store logins and verify users based on their email address. After the login, the matchmaking process and chatbot were created primarily using javascript.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were several code-blocks that we ran into while building the website. There were several necessary components that were unfamiliar to us when implementing YAM. Creating a login procedure, a multi-level website design, and a texting component between users were the most prominent issues in our way to successfully building YAM. The way we tackled this issue is by asking various different mentors to provide alternative solutions than the ones we tried. Eventually, we were able to debug our own issues with the help of the mentors and were ultimately able to solve all of the code-blocks that were put in our way.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;re proud that, as teenagers, we&rsquo;ve been able to build a website that services a very specific need. We are very content with the fact that our application, implementation design, and testing of the product ran very smoothly, as this certainly denotes a mark in our career in web crafting. We are proud to have been given the opportunity to build a useful website with Los Altos Hacks, and we hope that our application will be revolutionary in meeting new people.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how important even the smallest of syntax errors is because even one error would cause the entire program to break and not compile. Additionally, we learned how useful HTML/JAVASCRIPT can be even when creating complicated projects like YAM.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for You and Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that we can bring YAM to the next level by upgrading the user interface of the website and will try to expand its reach to more than just one language. YAM services the important need in today&rsquo;s society - the ability to communicate with new people, and with YAM we hope that anyone can make a new friend any day.
