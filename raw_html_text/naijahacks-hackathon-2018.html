According to
                    <em>
                        UNICEF
                    </em>
                    statistics on
                    <em>
                        Education
                    </em>
                    in Nigeria: &ldquo;Nigeria&rsquo;s population growth has put pressure on the country&rsquo;s resources, public services, and infrastructure".
And definitely not Nigeria alone but Africa at large which is the utmost vision of our idea.
About 60% of the population of students in Nigeria are girls and many of them are said to drop out sooner than later.
As team members we've actually faced the problem of a faulty educational system in one way or the other, whereby either our teachers weren't observant of our academic abilities or our recent failings in a particular subject. So our potential of what we could have achieved never actualized. Most times the fault is neither the teachers, the parents or even the students. But the structure in place. Teachers have to battle too many paper work, social activity arrangements as well as scheduling their classes. Administrators have to battle keeping up with too many files on the table, trying to figure which is important and which isn't, students have too many course work to battle with. And most times have to sacrifice social life for academics. Wherein the social life should be part of the academics. And busy parents mainly cannot keep up with the happenings of the children and often too many times are dissatisfied by the service rendered by their wards or caretakers they employed for their children. So everyone suffers.

                <h2>
                    What Our Solution Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        Weal Space
                    </em>
                    is actually a platform that takes away the difficulty of the African education system. Weal Space helps the teachers to plan their schedule, save time with writing too much notes by sharing them online, create a classroom and keep in touch with troubled students and disgruntled parents.
It helps the administrators plan their schedule too. They Monitor school projects, events and so on as well as stay engaged with the activities of the school. Parents can stay in touch with payments in school, payment history as well as stay in touch with their children activities. So they don't have to be disgruntled by their wards anymore. Finally, students can create note summaries as well as stay updated with events, scholarships, academic performance as well as socialize(chat) with other students just in case they want a quick information.
With this both the administrators and teachers can focus on effective service delivery to both the students and parents.
The students as well won't have to feel overwhelmed about anything. This definitely will reduce the number of problems that we are trying to solve.

                    How It was Built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its still much in development, but so far we have the front-end part of the whole platform. We are a team of 3 people and we did build it using
                    <em>
                        html5
                    </em>
                    ,
                    <em>
                        sass(css)
                    </em>
                    ,
                    <em>
                        javascript
                    </em>
                    .
                    <em>
                        React
                    </em>
                    will be included much later on
Our back-end would be in
                    <em>
                        express.js
                    </em>
                    and then
                    <em>
                        mocha
                    </em>
                    for unit testing.

                    Challenges We Faced

                <p>
                    We had problems working at equal pace as well as structuring our solution.

                    What we are Proud of

                <p>
                    Initially we didn't know the route our project will go, but from those inconveniences we were able to stumble and come back to a reasonable path for creating a school space online where every manual activity that competes with effective service delivery is eliminated. Now we are happy we can submit at least something.
