                <p>
                    Because you've been hacking away in the basement all weekend, you might have not noticed how dangerous Oxford can be. You are forewarned. Traffic accidents are a constant risk, especially in a busy city where students cycle 10 minutes to lectures. There was literally an accident five days ago on high street.

                    Most of the time, we go around the city forgetting that such high risks even exist, taking the shortest route possible. We want to remind you all that staying safe is so much more important than having an extra 3 minutes of sleep / procrastination.

                    The portal visualises traffic accident risk based on a record of past incidents in the UK. Users can search for locations, or routes to take them from one place to another. Instead of typical route planning where the criterion for the best route is just the duration, we suggest multiple routes that take you to the same destination with a risk score assigned calculated based on the frequency, severity and weather conditions of past incidents. We also show a heatmap to indicate the risk in the surrounding area.
