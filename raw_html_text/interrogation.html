                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  Since this was out first hackathon it was very stressful but fun. We needed to learn how to use Git, since that was 
        how we were going to submit the project and we needed a way of file sharing. Another issue was the time constraint 
  and our lack of experience, but that won't be a problem anymore for out future events.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Even though the program has issues, it still runs and the code is easy to follow. We are proud we were able to 
    complete our first fast paced program in a limited time, and the fact we were able to work in a group for so long 
 uninterrupted.  
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We learned how to use git, and we learned that the project isn't limited to only coding, next event we might use 
    physical objects like a keyboard and program it, or maybe VR, or even make something robotic since we know we 
 have more tools to play with.

                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Maybe nothing, or maybe we can add simple graphics, or maybe we can even make it into a real video game 
demo since there are game development engines available for free. We can go many ways with this and we have 
our options open.
