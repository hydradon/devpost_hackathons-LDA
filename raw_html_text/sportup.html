                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being in college, it is extremely difficult to plan sporting times that suits availability of all players. Due to this we are seldom able to plan to play sports like basketball with our friends. But many times on reaching the courts/field, we find that all the fields/courts are already occupied.  This inspired us to build an app, that allows users to book courts based on sport, location and date and time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the app, users can book courts based on sport, location, date and time. Users can view the available time slots for a particular sport,  courts and date, and accordingly plan their event and book.
Users can also view events created by other users, based on sport, location and date filters. While booking the event,  users can fill in if their group has empty spots for other players to join. Others can then view if an event has empty slots, and contact (using contact number) the event creator to join the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using swift, and used the Firebase Database as our backend.
                </p>

                    What's next for SportUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add notifications section, where users will get notified about their upcoming events.
We also plan to add the feature inside the app, where users can just contact the event creator directly using the app
