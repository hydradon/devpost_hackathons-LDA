                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love cooking and there were many times I used ingredients/herbs/spices which I haven't seen or used previously in my dishes.Adding wrong ingredient could make a dish from delicious to humilicious infront of guests.
I thought this problem could be face by many people like me around the world.
Since I know how to make Alexa skills I thought why not make a skill using APL(Amazon presentation language) as no skill was available in the market/store which could show the user about the spices/herb and its photo.
I am from india and we used many spices in our food so from here the skills got its name as 'Indian Spices' Alexa skill.
This is how 'Indian spices' skill idea was generated .

                    The skill will show the user about the spice/herb and its photo which the user wants to find.

                <p>
                    The main challenge was to show the information on various alexa devices using APL.Since i was using it for first time it took me while to get hang of it.Later I found out that it as simple  as making a webpage using html , css and some APL terms like pager,container,list etc.
