                    We were inspired to create an app that improves the language learning process. Stories is an iOS app that helps you learn a language by reading. It lets you translate words and phrases you don&rsquo;t know which helps you learn words in context. Stories offers French.

                    When you're learning a new language, it is inevitable that you're going to find a word that isn't part of your vocabulary. Stories focuses on emphasizing that reading at any pace exposes you to more vocabulary and grammar, which trains you to use your language better in your own speech. With Stories, the user can tap the unknown vocabulary word, see the English definition, and save the term into a flashcard.
