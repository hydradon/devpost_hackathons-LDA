                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clickers are not great for students. They are expensive, and not useful outside of class. Why not utilize the super computer in your pocket to do the same thing? We decided to create a clicker site and backend, so that students can take professor polls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This site allows both professors and students to login, and professors can create polls, which the students then answer. We (will) be using GPS to force students to answer from their classroom, providing the benefit that clickers give.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a ReactJS front end, with a Java and Postgres backend, hosted with Heroku.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the front-end and backend was difficult, as we've never done that before. In addition, serving dynamic content was quite a challenge! It was also the first time we used Postgres and Java, so the whole backend was a new learning experience
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tackled a (too) large project and got a significant amount of work done in a short period of time
                </p>

                    What's next for Inclusive Click
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to do a lot of cleanup and quality checks, that we didn't have time to do during the hackathon! Also, it would be good to make the system more user friendly, including graph displays and options for professors to more easily create polls and give grades. Finally, some of our security needs to be patched, so that is a TODO item.
