                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We get our idea from two games: Lifeline and HOOKED. And we both like room-escape games, so we decide to do one ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to provide an realistic and immersive experience for the player. The players should look at the story and find clues in the conversation, and they have to look for certain objects related to the story. If the players find all the useful elements and make the right choice, they can survive the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a javascript library called p5.js, it provides us with some built-in functions that help us easily draw the story setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The story is somehow complicated and we have to design all the possible cases. We don't have enough time to implement all scenarios we intended to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We invite some people to play the game, and they work really hard to finish the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a lot in using the library.
                </p>

                    What's next for Friends

                <p>
                    We want to finish the whole story line.
