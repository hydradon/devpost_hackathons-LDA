                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by seeing inappropriate LinkedIn photos or other photos people used on professional networking sites.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our platform analyzes peoples profile images and uses classifications from the googles-vision platform to determine if the proper criteria.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the google vision platform which uses google AI to detect keywords
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially had difficulty authenticating with the google api, and we also didn't realize we were writing code for the depreciated version of google cloud "gcloud". We then converted out application to use "google-cloud"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the authentication to work with the google api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned is that we were unable to train the google cloud vision platform in the same way we could train the IBM Watson vision platform. The google vision platform does work really well for object detection though.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Profile Checker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we plan on trying to use another platform capable of tracking more emotions which can be used to check profile photos for dating and other social media websites as well.
