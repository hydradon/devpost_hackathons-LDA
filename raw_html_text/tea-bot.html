                        We have a raspberry pi hooked up to a kettle. An android app is used to detect the emotions in a face. An API request is sent to Azure to detect if you look sad. If you do, it'll send a request to the Python API server running on the Raspberry Pi and start controlling the motors and relay to start the kettle, pump the water and dunk a tea bag into the cup.

                        Android development is very difficult compared to web development methodologies for building apps such as React-Native.

                        A lot of our components would break randomly, which lead to a lot of time spent fixing it
