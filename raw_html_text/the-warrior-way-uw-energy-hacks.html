                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Urban Planning students, we were interested in exploring and presenting a transportation-focused idea that addressed some of the objectives that are highlighted in the University's Sustainability Action Plan.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows UW students and staff to coordinate rideshares within, to, and from Waterloo. This carpooling method attempts to reduce the volume of incoming vehicles and parking occupancy on campus. Thus, aiming to reduce total carbon emissions from private automobiles coming into campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Figma to develop a prototype of our interactive app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On Figma, we were unsure at first how to link our prototype pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our team's first hackathon and we were able to dip our feet into web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt (via feedback from a mentor) that when it comes to mobile app development for future, we can't create something for just one mobile operating system, we have to keep in mind the other operating systems (e.g. Apple vs. Android). This would probably be important in regards to the coding aspect of app development.
                </p>

                    What's next for The Warrior Way
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It would be worthwhile to have a better understanding of coding and UX design to test out more prototypes.
