                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have lived in Mumbai, Bangalore and Pune. Some of India's biggest cities. We've witnessed problem of usable water availability. WRC concept attracted me as it promised transparent and open solution to water reuse and takes care of penalties for those who fail to comply. And this all by design. Also we are interested in social impact blockchain technology can have on daily life.
                </p>

                    In slides attached and walk through video, we have mentioned following points:

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The domain is new and this was first time with blockchain, setting up Hyperledger Fabric and creating SmartContract (known chaincode) was bit challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We as a team worked together for the first time. Akshay did ML using Spark ML. Ashish setup Hyperledger Fabric. And as a team we tried to address wide spectrum of solution for concerned problem statements.

                    What's next for WaterCoin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to work on ML models and try to fine tune our process. Also if we get funding for the project, we can actually implement the solution. From IoT device design to backend to deployment in real water reuse plants across industries.
