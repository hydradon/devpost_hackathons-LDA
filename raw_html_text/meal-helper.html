                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of our friends have experienced the "freshmen 15" or lost an unhealthy amount of weight from eating at the DC. In general if you are trying to lead a healthy lifestyle or trying to work out, the DC doesn't  help you sustain that lifestyle and essentially promotes an unhealthy lifestyle with the variety of foods available. So to fix this issue we created an app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app lets the user input their data like weight, height, etc. Then it gets the DC menu for either lunch, dinner, breakfast, or late night from the DC website. Depending on if the person is trying to gain, lose, or maintain weight the app gives the user a list of the food, with the top being the dish he/she should eat and the bottom being the dish he/she should avoid.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java, Android Studio, Go lang, Google Cloud, and rest api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time using Android Studio so each one of us had to figure out how to use it. We also had to refresh our memory of Java. We were inexperienced with github, so we had to learn that. Parsing and Formatting of the Data was also a challenge we can into.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that were able to create a working version of our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about parsing, we learned to use github better, and got experience with the Android Studio.
