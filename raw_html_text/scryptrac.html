                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    100,000 people die yearly from using prescription drugs according to a doctor's instructions. This is a huge cost of poor quality. A significant portion of these deaths and the 1.5 million hospitalizations caused by the same problem could be avoided with better recordkeeping. HIPAA and the blockchain provide an opportunity to make strides in an otherwise intractable problem space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product uses blockchain technology and authentication for all parties involved in the delivery of healthcare services related to prescription drug use. By keeping an immutable record of events that occur in the lifecycle of a doctor's prescription and providing easy access to all authorized parties, we intend to use transparency as enabled by blockchain technology to drive out common sources of failure and poor quality that lead to human injury and death.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our application with Qtum smart contracts for access control and auditing assurances. NodeJS API interface between the HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript Frontend. There are also partial UI Implementations for specific use cases in ReactJS and ReactNative, including a mobile app which patients can use to track their self-administration.
