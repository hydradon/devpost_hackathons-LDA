                <p>
                    The need to strengthen the ties between neighbors by caring about each other's health and safety.
People are often more unaware of their health than that of others like parents.

                <p>
                    iOS and Android app
Allows the user to post their comments about health and store them in the Firebase database.
Allows the user to "like" other people's comments.
Potentially shows the user how positive your comments are by using Google Cloud API and how it changes by time. This makes the user more aware of their mental conditions.

                    Used Flutter, a software for cross-platform mobile developments, to develop GUI.
Used Firebase to manage user accounts and store the comments users post.
Using the Google Cloud API for Natural Language Procession to analyze how positive the user's comments are.
