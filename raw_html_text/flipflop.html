                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea came by learning React in Codecademy, where they told us to choose a pet and 'armadillo' was the default option. From there, we started watching some documentaries on exotic animals and ended up thinking about making an app which would give you the geolocation of the closest platypus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As one could expect, it did not seem an idea we could carry out so, when we realised that we had APIs which worked with AI and Face Recognition we knew what we had to do: Take your face and put it in the animal's face place...
                </p>
                <p>
                    The platypus is such an interesting animal so that it is an interesting subject not only for evolutionary biology, but for some 2nd and 3rd year Computer Science students who like his behaviour and the curious characteristic that they are the only mammals who lay eggs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web application takes your picture, makes something funny out of it (this is where the platypus and other animals come in) and then based on your mood also recommends places you might like to visit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Microsoft Azure to host our backend and also for the analysis of face from photos (Face API). Our backend runs on Python Flask + Pillow (imaging library). Our frontend uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The frontend communicates with the backend using AJAX. In addition to that, we also used the Google Maps API for the place suggestions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to use React, but that turned out to be too cumbersome for us. We also had a couple of technical issues, such as setting the DNS records for our domains and configuring the Azure services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe we created a fun and creative application that uses technologies we haven't used before, such as facial recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Planning is important. How to use various new APIs, even those that we didn't use in the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FlipFlop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ironing out details in graphics, better suggestions for places.
