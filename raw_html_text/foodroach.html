                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are international graduate students who have just come to Dartmouth. Having a very hectic academic schedule to follow, we have no time to cook food for ourselves. Further we are not that insistent on spending large sums of money on food from restaurants outside. In the initial weeks we had to attend a lot of orientation meetings which provided a lot of free food for us thereby saving us the trouble of having to find food. Over time we have come to understand the power of free food within the campus and how searching for free food is a integral part of graduate student life. But finding free food in this large campus is very difficult and students have to dig a lot to get them. As the saying goes 'Necessity is the mother of invention', we decided to empower graduate students with technology to find free food within the campus.

                <p>
                    -App to find free food within the campus.
-Most of the information is available online to students.
-But hidden beneath all the pages of the university.
-Student has no time to look at it or search for it.
-Students forget the information.!
-foodRoach to the rescue.
-Inspired by the mighty cockroach which can find food anywhere.!
