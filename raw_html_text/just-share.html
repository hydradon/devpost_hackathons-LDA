                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This solution focuses on the 2 of 3 R&rsquo;s (Reuse, Reduce)
It will promote a sharing ideology, thus motivating users to buy less and share more.
This, in turn, will reduce the carbon footprint contribution by these &lsquo;EXCESS&rsquo; items drastically and will revolutionize the way people think about owning things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is Just-Share?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just-Share is a mobile application which facilitates the renting of goods between communities and peer groups, ensuring safe payment and insurance of the rented goods. This application is built on the idea of sharing economy which will reduce the carbon footprint and promote sustainability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How does it work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The lenders provide information (price, photos, availability times) and renters can reach them by searching for the item.
The renters can customize searches based on ratings, prices, location etc
The app connects them and if a deal is reached and the price is locked, the app charges the renter and holds the money
During this process, the lender is given a choice of insurance and charged for it.
After the transaction of the item is complete (item is returned back to owner), both parties rate each other (for ease, quality, condition) and the lender is paid directly through the app.
Thus the transaction is completely secure and hassle free on user&rsquo;s end, thus motivating sharing/lending
                </p>

                    Insurance required:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This will be an important and distinguishing feature of the application. It will allow the lenders and renters to have damages covered through insurance and help StateFarm to earn revenue as well. Win-Win situation for all.
                </p>

                    Blooming funda: PwC predicts a $335 billion market of shared economy by the year 2025.
The sharing of &lsquo;garage items&rsquo; is a win-win situation for all.
Quickly adoptable considering the sharing revolution effect on millennials.

                    Challenges?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apart from challenges in building the application; we think we will face the following challenges initially:
Hesitation of users: Initially, lenders might be hesitant to lend items dear to them.
Action-plan: Complimentary insurance from State Farm can help solve this hesitation.
Competition: We are not alone trying hands on this.
Action-plan: Being the first few among others and experience with marketing sharing platforms will help build an initial base.
