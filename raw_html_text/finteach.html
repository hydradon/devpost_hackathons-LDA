                    Our app teaches clients how to handle their finances. We created a highly simplified trading practice account, that initially only introduces users to very basic buy and sell options. We then use Artificial Intelligence to analyze the risk tolerance and trading habits of users. This analysis allows us to tailor educational material directly to each user. This is a powerful learning tool for those low in financial literacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of the data we gather on users is collected and presented in an easy to use interface for banking experts. Bank experts can view users&rsquo; purchase history, and risk tolerance. Most importantly are the product suggestions. Our AI infers what would be valuable to users based on their data, such as GICs, mutual funds, and savings plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, we believe that we can change customers perspectives of banking through how they physically relate to their branches. When users have reached a certain level of skill in their financial learning journey, we welcome them to an education meetup at their local [TD/CIBC] branch. At this meetup, they are able to create a personal connection with their local banking experts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This technology will give banks an unprecented access to customers. With live artificial data analysis always suggesting new financial products a user might be interested in, and with clients coming into branches to create personal connections, this will be an entirely new means of creating financially capable and educated customers that take advantage of options like GICs, Credit Cards, Mutual Funds, and more. We believe that the most effective way to create lifelong clients is through education. Through machine learning analysis of users&rsquo; habits and risk tolerance, we are able to effectively train and prepare them to feel confident about their futures.
