                    Automated emails from different sites inspired me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scrapes web and AQI data from google and sends it in an email
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ran into trouble by not being able to send the email in a format I wanted to and unfortunately I was not able to solve this. I also ran into trouble by not being able to encrypt the password data
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned how to scrape data from a website and learned to use smtplib package to make my bot send the email through gmail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope to make the bot more user friendly and interesting with a lot more data and data visualizations.
