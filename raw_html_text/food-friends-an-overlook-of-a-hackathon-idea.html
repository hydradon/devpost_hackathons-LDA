                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So, I had a team with a solid idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except, we couldn't get it to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, we disbanded. An unfortunate happenstance that may even happen to the best of teams. So, I thought of all the challenges we went through and my experience, and decided to compile it into a web page for all to see.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's just a website I give PennApps my sarcastic outlook on life. Not directly at PennApps though (y'all have been great), but hackathons in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using that Domain.com promo code, baby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eh, it was pretty simple. Drag and drop. One of my ex-team members sneezed so loudly and that was distracting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can't believe I made an actual site. And the domain name doesn't even fit!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next time, make sure you're idea is secure before you make a domain name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Food Friends: An Overlook of a Hackathon Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe I'll post my compilation video of my hackathon experience. Get that whole imagery stuff going on, you know?
