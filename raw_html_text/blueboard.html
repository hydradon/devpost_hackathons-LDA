                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for BlueBoard was to create a web app that incorporates productivity features into a singular work space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BlueBoard is a web application that will allow students to collaborate on documents and message group members. In the time we had during CrimsonHacks, we managed to develop our own back end and user interface, incorporating Quill and our own messaging service within the app.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a flask back end with socket.io and used traditional web tech for the front end to prototype.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging aspect was attempting to develop a full stack web app with a team of two people. It was a great experience, but with time constraints we were forced to leave out some features.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able stay focused on our individual tasks while also working as a team. We created a working collaborative environment with minimal prior experience, and we had a lot of fun doing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about socket.io and web socket technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BlueBoard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the time constraints, we have plenty of unfinished ideas for BlueBoard. We want to incorporate web widgets into a scroll bar and possibly a drag and drop file system and friends list. The amazing thing about BlueBoard is the it can be expanded into many use cases by adding plugins.
