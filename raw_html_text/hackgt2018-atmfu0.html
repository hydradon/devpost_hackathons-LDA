                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millennial of our generation are enthralled by the idea of self-development and soaking knowledge that brings them to their full potential. FOCUS is a technology that guides people to live a lifestyle of improved sustainability, consistency and self-monitoring to effectively accomplish their goals.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    FOCUS uses data driven technology to improve people's ability to block out distractions and take daily actions towards specific goals. It allows them to break apart large goals into doable tasks whose efficiency can be tracked.The app will use meditations and proven philosophical principles aligned with an individualized data driven recommendations to track progress and develop.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using HTML, CSS, Java and Azure. I began by brainstorming based on what i was interested in, self- development. I then researched the relevancy of self help in the lives of people and found that it was very popular in Millennial. This led me to look more into the obstacles that hinder success for people who are involved in a form of self-help. And from there I came up with solutions and talked to over 15 HackGT participants about their goals and hindrances.

                <p>
                    I learned some Java Script, CSS, Machine Learning, Azure. I learned about APIs and their usefulness in our code, and how many different languages can work together. The most important thing I learned is the need to plan and think through ideas.
