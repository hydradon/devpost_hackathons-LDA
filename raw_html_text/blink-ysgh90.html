                    There have been times when pulling out my phone and opening the camera app has taken too long that I miss out on capturing the moment. With BLINK you can take pictures immediately without having to wait. The photos are saved on your device and allowing for ease of access. I decided to use python and OpenCV as they were the best solution at the moment.
