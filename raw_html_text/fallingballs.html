                    This is a game I made using Java's Applet and Graphics libraries
                </p>
                <p>
                    HOW-TO: 
Run Server-
Run the ServerRun
start server
                </p>
                <p>
                    Run Client-
    Edit IP in code (around line 80)
    Run ClientRun, (make sure server is active) 
    Click on the Applet. Enter your username. 
    You should be connected now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Playing the game-
    WASD to move
    R to Ready up (will start the game when 100% of players are ready) (this starts/resets the game)
    SPACEBAR to use skill (automagicly assigns teleport to player, teleports to shadow character under mouse)
    ENTER to start a message, Enter again to send.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hack-Harassment- Uses a trie tree to determine if a bad word was said. (search time of logn) If something bad was said, it factors it into the user rating. if user rating gets too high, it notifies the user "Please try to be nicer, or else!" Each bad word has a multiplier, and effects the user rating differently. It also multiplies higher the more you do it each day, as well as a separate multiplier for consecutive days of harassment. It has a VERY high multiplier for continues harrasement against a particular person. (Utilizes wat.ai to parse the information and find intent and subject).
