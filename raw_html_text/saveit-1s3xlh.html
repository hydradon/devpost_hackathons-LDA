                    In every class there are some chairs reserved for students with disabilities. 
Not once or twice we saw them arriving to class and all the reserved chairs are already taken.
For this issue we created ' saveIT '.
In our system each of the disable students will be able to make check-in for his coming lesson.
By simply selecting the chair he wants, the led on the selected chair changes from green red and all his other class mates will know this chair is occupied.

                <p>
                    In order to give life for our idea we use several platforms:
&bull; Creating DB in MSSQL for the controllers, the app data(classes, chairs) and the users
&bull; Burning software to the controller using C
&bull; Building the web app using asp .NET
                </p>
                <p>
                    During our work we face some difficulties especially on the question "which platform will give us the ideal outcome?".  In addition, we though a lot about fairness, how to give our product real and fair meaning for the disable students and on the same time, not harm the other student's rights.

                <p>
                    We feel that the accomplishment we're most proud of is the use of all our knowledge we acquired during the two last years and combining it to an actually running system.
We have learned that by hard work and motivation our thoughts can see light and becoming a real thing.
