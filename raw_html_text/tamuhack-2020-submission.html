                    We want the general focus of our project to be on accessibility, particularly in the College Station area. All of us having lived in College Station for over 18 years have experience with what College Station is lacking in terms of accessibility. For example, not all buildings in town are easy to navigate for the disabled. There are countless places that offer resources for those who need them, yet they go underutilized, simply because people are unaware of them. Our goal for TamuHack is to create a tool to allow users to share places that offer useful services and rate the accessibility of various locations.

                    This was our first hack so we were focused on learning to use new tools and gain experience.
Admittedly, we bit off more than we could chew. We were all beginners to web design and expected it to be easier than it turned out to be. Considering we were all novices we are all happy with our (scuffed) but semi functional website.
