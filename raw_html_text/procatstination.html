                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we sat at our first hachathon, we were feeling vastly overwhelmed and started procrastinating. We then decided that a professional procrastination tool is what the world needs and thus proCATstination was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an Arduino, we connected a pipe cleaner to read physical stimuli as an input. Through the Arduino's sketch, python and javascript, this input will trigger a random cat video to load through the browser. The HTML and javascript codes are hosted by a Microsoft Azure cloud server/virtual machine while the python runs locally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    tl;dr - Touch a small dongle and instantly get a random cat video.
                </p>
