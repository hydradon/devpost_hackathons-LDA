                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trustify allows mods and streamers to create a more accountable community by &ldquo;trusting&rdquo; a user. This user is then known in the current and other streams for being an upstanding community member. The mods and streamer can use the chatbot to trust or untrust users and this will be displayed to the channel viewers in the panel below. By rewarding and recognizing members who are exceptional, we incentivise a safer community and platform.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Twitch Developer Rig to develop our display panel and Glitch to create our chatbot. We learned a lot about external libraries available to Twitch developers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting familiar with how Twitch&rsquo;s example code was all interconnected to determine how to structure our code was a fairly involved process that we didn&rsquo;t expect to take as long as it did. Also our team was not particularly familiar with the node modules that are used to build extensions (such as the example ones).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a functioning IRC chatbot within our first Twitch extension. We learned a lot more about the different pieces of an extension and how they work together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Trustify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As seniors in college, we all have a lot of free time and the desire to learn more skills. We hope to stick with Trustify and one day turn it into a full extension that streamers can use to build their communities in an easy way.
