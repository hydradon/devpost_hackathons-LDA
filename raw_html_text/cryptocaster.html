                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the current trends in Cryptocurrency and its extreme volatility due to various major social, political and economic events all over the world. 
A major barrier to newcomers becoming involved in Cryptocurrency is its perceived volatility and uncertainty. So, we attempt to show some rationale behind its massive fluctuations in price, to perhaps allow it more acceptance in the mainstream
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses the massive power of large-scale Deep Learning systems today to accurately predict Bitcoin prices in the near (and not-so-near) future

                    <li>
                        Used the Aylien API to collect relevant articles related to a keyword from all over the web, even rating sites based on their 'authority'
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Used the Google Natural Language Processing API to classify these articles based on a sentiment value
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Collected historical Bitcoin price info (using Coinbase), and stored it on a Microsoft SQL database running on Microsoft Azure, along with the sentiment values
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Used a TensorFlow-based predictive model running on Google Cloud ML, trained on the above historical data, to predict future Bitcoin pricing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tested this model by stepping back into various points in the past, and verifying that the predictions made by our predictive model correlate with what we now know to be reality
