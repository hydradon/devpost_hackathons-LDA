                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to help students to be more social and help them to connect to each other based on their sports interests. Sports is the best communication tool so we believe it will really help students to be more active, social and healthier.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It collects students basic information about their sports interests and finds people with similar interests. This platform helps students organize their sports activities from A to Z.  For example, if you are looking for soccer, golf, or ski diving partners you can easily find them on this platform.
