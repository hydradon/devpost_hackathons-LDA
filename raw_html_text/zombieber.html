                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Justin Bieber.  The man who has it all. But has he died by a zombie? No.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a zombie apocalypse simulation where you have the chance to be Justin Bieber.  How long can Justin survive with his fate in your hands?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game was built using Unity with C-sharp scripts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the team members have used Unity before or made a serious attempt at making a full game, so we had trouble using the interface due to lack of experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is fully functional. The game has functioning menus, full soundtrack, and a great protagonist.  Although no one in the team had experience with any of the used technology, hard work paid off and we are extremely happy with our creation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of planning and software design.  We all agree that the project would have gone smoothly with less trial and error had the team put more thought into the big picture from the start. We all now have basic skills in game design that we all hope to explore further in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Zombieber
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sky is the limit. The team hopes to add more functionally to the game: playable mini-game, new songs, less buggy, better character animations, and multiple other features.  The team hopes to find a way to make the game available to a broader audience because right now the game is only available by download.  Ideally, the game would be available on a website.
