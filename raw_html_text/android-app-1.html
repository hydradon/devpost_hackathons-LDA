                    The Original Plan:
Create an app in android studio that utilizes google maps, geofencing, and car pooling to make a driver-oriented car pooling service. Individuals could open the app and login/sign up at which point they would be prompted to provide their phone number, license plate, and name. This information would be stored in a database using SQL or Google Firebase. A driver would then choose the starting and end location, which would promptly be mapped on google maps, at which point the geofencing will show a (default setting) 3km radius circle around the path. Any individuals requiring a ride would show up as "pings" on the map and the driver could click on these pings to obtain information about the riders such as where they need to be taken. The driver can choose to pick up these riders and will subsequently obtain credits based on the distance traveled (Perhaps per km). Credits would be spent when receiving rides and earned by giving rides.

                    What Happened:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We couldn't figure out how to connect the database to the register page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We couldn't figure out how to authenticate users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We couldn't figure out how to geofence.
At this point we realized we couldn't move forward and each member went about a new direction. I decided to continue my job of implementing the user login interface and tried my best to learn about databases and how to store data in them using Java/Android-Studio. The project is currently at a point where there are no compilation errors but the app crashes when it gets to the register page.
