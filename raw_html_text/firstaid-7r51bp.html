                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggle in school, and spending hours Googling just makes the struggle harder. We wanted to make an app which would alleviate the pain of Googling for the perfect resource, and instead would return the most relevant information from a user's query.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a minimalistic web app which provides the student with the most relevant results from their query.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the web app using Python and the Flask micro web-framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google blocked our API requests due to us requesting far too much.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we overcame some immense hurdles and got through this rollercoaster of a night with a functional product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that obstacles are everywhere, and that one must learn to accept such things.
                </p>

                    What's next for FirstAid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to add more resources, improve the AI, and upgrade the overall UI and UX.
