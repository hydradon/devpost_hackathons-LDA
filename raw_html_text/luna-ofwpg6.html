                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Luna is a response to the uninviting quality of poorly lit public spaces. 
The public's sense of safety and their wayfinding abilities are significantly impacted in dark outdoor spaces. 
We understand this to stem not only from a lack of lighting infrastructure but also from the absence of activity occupying outdoor night spaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By leveraging the IoT capabilities of LoRaWAN, Luna creates a safe, playful, and inviting way to navigate outdoor settings through human-centred LED lighting. Activated through an opt-in application accessed on the user's smartphone, Luna intensifies its coloured bulb(s) upon approach. This effectively creates an aesthetic, non-evasive lighting solution that activates space whilst enhancing users navigation and safety at night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have elected The University of Newcastle's Callaghan Campus as a case-study and prospective pilot location for the proposed Luna solution. Our campus data analysis, market research and stakeholder consultations have clearly indicated that the lighting-solution that Luna offers has sound applicability within the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the capabilities realised through the IoT technologies of the bulbs, Luna offers a versatile luminaire installation model which has been found to halve typical public lighting infrastructure costs. Furthermore, the increasing shift to public LED lighting for its energy saving and environmentally friendly qualities positions Luna&rsquo;s IoT enabled luminaires as a logical and exciting next step for public outdoor lighting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By leveraging IoT technology and the low powered, long-range wireless (LoRaWAN) network, Luna enables users to share their location data which works in communicating with the bulbs to interact and respond to the user upon approach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through Luna's pilot application programming interface (API), an opt-in service is available for Luna enabled locations to offer an opt-in service accessed through users smartphones. This confirmation triggers the bulbs to activate Luna's IoT technology which facilitates the user-responsive LED capabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of detailed and comprehensive data on foot traffic in specific public spaces and their attitudes toward existing lighting (outside of anecdotal).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges were experienced during the development of Luna's mock geographic data visualisation. Initially created through Apple's MapKit to support our software demonstration, this program posed to be too difficult to use within our timeframe. An alternative program was used with much greater success and achieved within our deadline, enabling the presentation of visualised mock data within our pitch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clarity of vision, team cohesion and commitment, and developing a workable demonstration in time for the pitch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a wide open market for the kind of solution we are developing. We appear to be ahead of the curve, but it is an obvious area of urban development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Luna
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At this stage, our key priorities include finding the right early adopters and then managing growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We intend to continue communications with UoN's Infrastructure Facility Services staff to gauge the next steps in our proposed campus pilot implementation. Nevertheless, we are very open to expressions of interest from public or private parties who see value in the proposed smart lighting solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of the campus context, the applications of Luna&rsquo;s human-centred lighting design are far-reaching. On a global scale, the night time economy is still in its infancy. Creating a large-scale socio-cultural shift towards activity after dark isn&rsquo;t an easy task. Through the playful smart lighting of Luna, the opportunities for after dark placemaking are boundless.
