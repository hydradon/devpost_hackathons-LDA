                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we wanted to build a fun quiz game mainly targets kids right now which is nothing like traditional games which game developers write the questions and answers manually. We tried to build a game that extracts questions and answers from raw data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses some data set that contains information about countries, capitals, cities and population. Questions are gathered without knowing the structure of the data using some kind of Data Analysis. After getting the questions and answer, the game that we built in Unity fetches the questions from web server in AWS and users can answer them by just hand gestures received by Leap Motion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AWS to store data and the web service that gives the questions. Unity 3D 5.3 for building the game and Leap Motion of course. PHP and MySQL for implementing a web server that outputs in json.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to build it in Windows first, after 6 hours of coding for the game in Unity it completely failed. So we started from scratch with Mac. After spending couple hours of more efficient coding, Unity in Mac froze and we lost all our design except C# codes. We spend couple hours just to find an appropriate data set.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although we didn't have any handful experience in Unity 3D or C#, in less than 24 hours we built a functional game with some complex features as getting data from a web server asynchroniously and Leap Motion which we also tried for the first time here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely learned Unity 3D with C# development. Some web services and data analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Motion Quiz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To sum up, the fact that we mainly focused on auto generated questions is because we will not need update questions occasionally, instead we will update question generator algorithms, so we can target all kind of people rather than just kids by customizing question types.
