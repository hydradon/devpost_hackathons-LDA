                <p>
                    In a time when students get distracted by their mobile phones, and have started neglected reading books, it is of utmost importance that we reintroduce the magic of books to young children. Accustomed to having visual feedback instantly, many young children find reading texts difficult, as they often find it mundane.

                    The application basically uses Deep Learning tools for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing to provide contextual images for each paragraph in a book. It tries to ensure that while reading a book, children get some kind of visual feedback, that could help nurture their imagination as well as make the hobby of reading interesting again.

                        using the API was a big task. We minimized the number of API calls on the backend to a
