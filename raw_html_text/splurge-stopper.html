                <p>
                    One of my life hacks for not spending money on things I don't need or really want is to think
about how much money I could have later if I invest it instead. There are definitely caveats
to investing, but this trick has stopped me from buying things I would have regretted later.

                    skill. You ask it why you shouldn't spend a certain amount of money,
and it replies with how much money you might have in the future if you invest it instead.

the code is hosted on Lambda.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    Parsing the money amount was the hardest part because as of now, there is no built-in slot type
for money (which was really surprising). As a workaround, I had to use two slots and many more
utterances.

                <p>
                    I found out about the Alexa Skills Challenge a few days before it ended, and I've never worked
with the platform before, so I had to come up with something that was small in scope. I'm glad 
I got it done though.

                    I learned how to create a basic Alexa skill. This was also the first time I used Lambda.
