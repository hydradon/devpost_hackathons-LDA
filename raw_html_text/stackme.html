                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In conjunction with the rapid growth of eCommerce, warehouses have become important staples in the world economy. Although some companies, like Amazon, are able to run their warehouses with optimal operational efficiency, the top 20 companies only own 30% of the warehouse supply. For the rest of the 70%, there are many challenges to overcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What StackMe provides, is an affordable avenue to identify and maximize warehouse space, maximize profit, and reduce labor costs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StackMe uses ultrasonic sensors to calculate the distance from the top of a shelf to the stacked inventory. What this allows is the ability to easily identify shelves with available space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    StackMe also provides space and shipment matching, to simplify the operation process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This simplifies warehouse operations and helps companies generate additional tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars with just a simple IoT installation.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the SDK Breakout to relay info from the sensor to a Node.js server. We then created a Pusher app that pushes that data to a consumer side app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing C code to get the sensor to communicate with Twillio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a product that can scale to warehouses nationally and worldwide to help businesses maximize profits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A little bit of everything from each other and the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StackMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next step is to go from our box model to a real warehouse level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, mass production.
