                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kids are interacting more in voice and I want to make their learning fun with voice and UI about the Jungle and jungle life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill provides educational content to kids to learn about jungle in an interesting way.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly, I built it for participating in this challenge. But, APL learning was looking little tough in the beginning. So it was not that easy to use APL in the skill initially.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of testing device. 
Came to know late by Jan only.

                    It is fun building Alexa Skills.

                    I will keep add some sound clips to make it more interesting for kids. It is not a startup Idea, So I will try to make sure kids are getting engaged and learn.
