                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by old arcade games and Alexa's open API, we decided to put them together and create endless fun time for friends and family.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Play text based games using Alexa and voice commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a web scraper to get text from
                    <a href="http://www.web-adventures.org" rel="nofollow">
                        http://www.web-adventures.org
                    </a>
                    in order to not just have 1 game but a library that you can play right away.
We create an Alexa skill that we deployed on AWS Lambda. The skill takes speech input from player and reads the response from the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Scraping a website and coming up with an FW looking generic way for all games
Creating Alexa skills - dealing with complicated non-english game names.
Using AWS Lambda and creating player interactions that made sense.

                <p>
                    We started with 0 experience on Friday - installing it for the first time.
So we learned about: Scraping, AWS and especially Lambda and FaaS, Alexa's API and more
