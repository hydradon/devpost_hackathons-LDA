                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love reading and helping others! We had summer reading assignments, but no platform at which we could discuss our opinions on the books, so we wanted to create an app to help alleviate that problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects and engages readers who are reading the same or similar books.
Upcoming feature: connect to libraries, get suggestions from users and personalized ones from us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially intended to make an applet but changed our minds because we knew we couldn't finish on time  and made a website. We used  HTML, CSS, and bootstrap and did it at the last second !!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We changed ideas last second since applet wasn't our strong point. Connectivity was a little slow but we did it! #girlpower

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took us 10+ hours to do the original but we finished the final one under 2 hours :) (after changing our minds!!!)
It looks really nice as well here:
