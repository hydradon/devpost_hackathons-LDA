                    Seattle is great city to be in. One group member lives here and vouches for it. The other members appreciate their visit. HOWEVER, gentrification is changing Seattle. Communities which have resided in the area for decades are being pushed out as development is marketed to high earning prospective residences. Our platform attempts to empower communities with information and resources to respond to incoming trends accordingly.

                    We learned there is a lot to think about before you can even start to create something. Even if our idea wasn't perfect, we learned that it was important to begin working on something so that we could improve. We also learned how to empathize better with communities in the Seattle area.
