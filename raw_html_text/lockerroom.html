                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All great ideas originate in college dorm rooms. One night, a few days before this hackathon, I was in the shower and suddenly had the idea of making a website where guys can post anonymously about girls and girls can post anonymously about guys. People would not be able to see what is written about them, and people would be able to post authentic and genuine content about other people. Thus, LockerRoom was created.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Guys can post anonymously about girls and girls can post anonymously about guys. People cannot see what is written about them, and people can post authentic and genuine content about other people. With this, people will be able to know the "flip side" of a potential partner and decide whether or not they want to pursue a long-term relationship.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the website itself. We also wanted the contents of the website to be seen by anyone with a link to the website, so we also used Google's Firebase to store the website's information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything. Literally everything. On a more serious note, there were a lot of desired features that we were not able to implement due to time constraints/sleep depravation. We also ran into issues with the idea itself and needed to find ways to solve these issues while still maintaining the authenticity of the content that people post on the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how much we were able to accomplish in such a short amount of time. We are also proud of how much we learned at this hackathon and are looking forward to building upon our new skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Firebase and its database services as well as how to collaboratively use GitHub to make this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LockerRoom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make LockerRoom into a big thing that everyone can use in the future. We have plenty of ideas for expansion and so little time to list them, but look for the option to "Agree" with other anonymous posts as well as other additional features.
