                <p>
                    This site tracks your daily meals. Given your food intake or an image url of your food, the goat will grow or shrink based on the healthy or unhealthy foods eaten, respectively. This app can also be incorporated into healthy care in terms of giving patients the motivation to regulate the diet given by their healthcare provider. There is also a social aspect to this site as you can log in Facebook and see how your friends are doing in terms of their diet goals. It is a light hearted game-like site that is easy to access and helpful.

                    Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, we created a platform for a sheep growing site. On the site, you can log into Facebook, enter your healthcare plan, the food you ate that day, and see your friends' profiles.
