                    Spot is an Android mobile application that serves as a way to track a group of people's movements over a decently sized area and gauge the amount of area covered through the usage of Google Maps.

                    Usage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spot can be used in many ways. For example, a group of friends can use use Spot to eliminate previously searched locations in a simple game of hide-and-seek or scavenger. More importantly, Spot can be used as a way to manage a search party, keeping track of a group of people as they search for a target, whether it may be a missing person or a valuable object. It will be possible to monitor previously covered across all devices so every member of the search party will be able spread out and cover as much non-overlapped area as possible while keeping track of other group members. Once the object or person is found, one team member will be able to alert everyone else in the group.
