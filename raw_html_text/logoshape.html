                    Challenges the player to survive in an increasingly chaotic cardboard build arena

                <p>
                    Created in Unity, and from coloured card for the assets

                    I originally started work on a puzzle game and scrapped this at 9 on Sat morning, so both Time and tiredness from the initial night have been against me.

                    Glad to have made a game in limited time that plays and effectively has a beginning middle and end
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was experimenting with building assets from Card, which is something I'm looking at for a future project... this gave me an insight into this
                </p>
                <p>
                    I need to add some decent menus and effects in the game.  I have a full time project so it might be a while beforeI can revisit this though
