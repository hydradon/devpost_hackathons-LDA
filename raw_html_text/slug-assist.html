                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we first entered UCSC as incoming freshmen, we found that it was difficult to locate the various resources that UCSC provides. As a result, we decided to create a website that provides easy access to important resources in a simple layout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Slug Assist is a service that provides instant access to important student resources across campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Slug Assist was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. We also used services such as GitHub to coordinate our project.
                </p>
