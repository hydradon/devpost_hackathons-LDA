                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Princeton's free food listserv. As hungry college students, food is a must, but the free food listserv is typically unorganized, rendering it difficult to actually locate the food it mentions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application allows users to add pins to different areas around campus with the location and description of the food. Moreover, it provides users with the option of removing a pin when the food is all eaten.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the Google Maps API, we used the Marker class and the InfoWindow class to respectively create pins and description windows for every instance of free food.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were definitely many challenges in implementing the Google Maps API due to a low proficiency of JavaScript and the dense, interminable Google Maps API. Another key struggle was integrating all of the code together especially because some code would interfere with the successful running of another piece of code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're definitely proud of being able to produce something! We both do not have much hacking experience, if at all, and creating this project entirely out of scratch was definitely satisfying. One of our largest accomplishments would be being able to save the food location and description, as well as remove the markers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely got more experience working with JavaScript, which will be very useful in the future as it is frequently applied towards web applications and web-based API's. It was also fun to work with the Google Maps API because maps have infinite applications in the real world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fur Real Food
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely want to improve our search bar with Google Map's AutoComplete class, so search results automatically appear before the user. Another idea is using the user's current location as the food location. The app itself could also be more visually appealing. In the future, we hope to have pictures available for the food, and we hope that this application will eventually be used outside of the Princeton campus since there's so much free food to be found.
