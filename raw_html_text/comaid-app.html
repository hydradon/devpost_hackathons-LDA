                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to work with an application and also work with text and audio conversions, so we found thunkable to do that. We came up with the idea through our interest in the five senses and how we can make up for those who are not able to use all of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It converts text to voice, camera picture identifies objects, and converts voice to text
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using thunkable
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked on one idea the entire day of Jan 27, but changed last minute the next morning to thunkable where we had to research how to use the application and how to make the app look presentable. We had to research how to add new features that we didn't know we could before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to add a professional sidebar which could navigate through the app in a user friendly manner. We also worked with text and voice conversions and also applied this concept to our camera recognition, making it able to describe objects around a person through pictures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use thunkable and make different features. We also learned how to work with different formats of information like audio and text and images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ComAid App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to alter our camera recognition so that it can automatically capture the surroundings of a person and automatically translate the text to voice. By doing this, we can make it more user friendly and allow people to be aware of their surroundings in an alternate way to sight.
