                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea behind FocusOn is based on a DJ created using AI that would be able to control the mood of a party based on cameras and sensors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original idea was mutated then into an assistant to the car, at the moment that we saw that this kind of application could work better as an assistant that as a DJ
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application control the user behavior based on a camera and the car sensors. In addition, it interacts with the user by asking for route changes or to stop or slow down the vehicle in situations of risk.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is divided into a frontend, built as an Android app, and a backend built with Django.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of the Android application the app is built with Java, using Google Maps API to provide a user interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of the Django server we have Scikit-Learn to run the different models, OpenCV to process images and calls to API like Spotify or Azure
                </p>
