                    Inspiration
                </h4>
                <p>
                    For our problem space, we wanted to focus our topic on mood, which can affect personal judgment, productivity, and relationships. To improve these aspects of our lives, we asked ourselves the question,
                    <em>
                        How might we positively shift the way people think to develop a more sustainable mental well-being?
                    </em>
                </p>
                <h4>
                    What it does
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Myndset converses with the user and takes in the spoken responses, detecting the person's mood using machine learning. Myndset also offers advice based on the user's answers. The mood and the conversation are then displayed on a digital calendar, where the user can see their mood for the day as well as all previous days. By having this information, the user can reflect on the factors that affect their mood and actively find ways to improve it.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    How we built it
                </h4>
                <p>
                    We first designed the UI with Figma and translated the designs to code through React and Node.js. In addition, the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services API was used to determine the sentiment of the responses from the user to assign the mood. Voiceflow is used to record and process the conversation between Myndset and the user, but it also returns advice to the user regarding their mood.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h4>
                <p>
                    We spent a lot of our time trying to connect things, particularly the Google Home mini. We also spent time trying to communicate between the Node.js server and the VoiceFlow because we tried to enter parameters to create an https request to connect to another service, however, the request would often time out.  Finding a method to record and also convert the user input into text.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Finishing on time! Being able to stay awake for so long and not be exhausted!
                </p>
                <h4>
                    What we learned
                </h4>
                <p>
                    To try out different technologies such as the Google Home mini and being able to work with new APIs. In addition, Ashley learned how to style and use a library material-ui to enhance the front end of our interface.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    What's next for Myndset
                </h4>
                <p>
                    In our next iteration, we would like to extend the functionality by adding more moods and having an option for the user to change the color for each mood. In addition, being able to extend the accessibility of the project and expand to smart home devices.
