                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In my high school there are always hyperlinks scattered on the wall containing important information. The annoying part is these links are always extremely incoherent and extremely long. I always type a 30 character link only to find out I have made three typos along the way. I'm solving the problem I face almost on a daily basis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cadence uses optical character recognition to recognize text and sort only the links inside said text. The browser will then open the link automatically so you don't have to waste type manually typing it up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Google Tesseract API for OCR and made an algorithm the parses through all the text and only leaves out the text that is useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hard part was finding a way to sort through the text in order to leave out unnecessary information for all cases. This took me a while to figure out but eventually I came up with a solution
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how extremely capable the devices in our pockets are. They are able to accurately recognize images, process them and send out information in a matter of seconds. This would never be convenient 5 years ago which shows how much the rate of technological progress is increasing
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cadence
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eventually I hope for Cadence to recognize text in real time with little to no input delay. This would drastically improve the ease of use and would also be a challenge worthwhile to solve. The design also needs a bit of touch up but overall I am happy what I created in a day
