                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is from the buzzfeed demo with the celebrities and a desire to work with hardware like the Oculus rift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have pictures of celebrity faces on cubes on different angles on each face of the cube placed on top of robot bodies. Each "celebrity" has a random movement or dance that they do. It is just a big party in a field. All dance moves, no matter how glitchy and weird, are intentional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Unity game engine with some cube blender models to make a VR dance party on the Oculus rift. We used some C# scripts and other translations methods provided by the Unity game engine to make the random and strange dance moves
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to have user input using the oculus remote to cause some of the movement in our interactive models, but there is a road block on the windows version of unity that prevented us from moving forward with that idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how quickly we picked up the Unity game engine and Blender modeling software. Three of our team members were relatively new to game development, and needed to learn a few things about Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to better use the Unity game engine and how to debug our games. We also learned how to use the Oculus rift with the Unity game engine
                </p>
