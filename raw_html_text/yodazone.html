                    In this day and age when everybody is perpetually stressed out, Yodazone is working towards building a stress free world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yodazone pulls data from multiple data sources and tracks spikes in stress levels. We build dashboards and graphs that report these spikes and also notify people via text or sms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were multiple challenges that our team ran into:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        There was a need to integrate data from microsoft band, however, lack of required APIs made it difficult to integrate the same.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Original dashboard library that the team planned to use does not exist anymore, so a new library was used instead.
                    </li>
                </ol>
