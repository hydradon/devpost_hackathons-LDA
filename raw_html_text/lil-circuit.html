                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teaching children about STEM and coding is not a new idea, in fact there has been a tremendous rise in the number of opportunites out there for the next generation to learn about programming, but not nearly as much focused on the logic and hardware behing the scenes; enter Lil' Circuit!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lil' Circuit is a fun interactive interface to help teach logic principles in the form of a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was created with the usage of a raspberry pi with a sense hat, all written in python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were challenges all along the way with getting our game to be as involved as we wanted it to be, so with our next update the game would receive multiple levels of difficulty and an unlimited amount of unique gameplay experiences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lil' Circuit is completely portable, which is awesome! With a bit of a charge you are able to take this fun game where you want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes hardware isn't the hard part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lil' Circuit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to reduce the size of our game and give more levels to make it more suitable for small fries.
