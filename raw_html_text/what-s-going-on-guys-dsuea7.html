                        What inspired us: We wanted to create an app that we could freely keep track of and delete our music preferences.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What we learned of is the technical difficulties and potential outcomes that occur within a crunch period where we have to develop a functional app within 24 hours.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also learned of how some technical issues or fatigue can impact productivity, for example, fire base took many hours to resolve because our app would not communicate with the cloud databases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other issues came from having to adapt to many different classes and objects that were made by other group mates and having to apply extreme programming practices like pair programming to efficiently solve coding issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Although there were many members who were inexperienced with java and android studio, they still applied themselves to work on UI and XML elements.
