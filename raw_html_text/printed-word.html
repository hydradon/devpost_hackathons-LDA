                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main idea for this hackathon stemmed from our group's love affair with 3D printers. The
number of steps it takes to go from a 3D model to an object in your hand is very intimidating for
beginners. It is not unreasonable for you to want to skip these steps altogether. While this tool may be
somewhat limiting to those with previous 3D printing knowledge, it creates a more accessible entry
point for those new to the hobby.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Printed Word acts as a seamless bridge between your words and the very code that runs 3D
printers. By integrating a home assistant into the process of 3D printing, we can remove the
intermediate steps that usually require the user to learn 3D modeling, slicing or in many cases both to
get started printing. This is all while leaving room for growth in the complexity of what Alexa can
understand and ultimately do with a given vocal command. Whether it be to change advanced printer
settings, or simply telling the printer to preheat for you. The boundaries are truly endless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began our project by first allowing our Raspberry-Pi (imaged with OctoPrint) to be
discoverable via the internet and connected to our test 3D Printer which allowed us remote access to
OctoPrint via the web interface it provides. There is a secure API-key generator, as well as a login, to
ensure your Raspberry-Pi and 3D printer are safe. This is a very important step on our list of goals to
reach because if we cannot communicate to the Raspberry-Pi, we have no way to control the printer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creating new skills for Alexa on the Amazon Echo Dot allowed us to send custom API calls when
we say a specific phrase. For example, you could say &ldquo;Alexa, tell the 3D printer to auto-home&rdquo; and in
response, Alexa would give you a confirmation and then behind the scenes, an API call would be made
to the OctoPrint and directed to auto-home the axes. Several different pronunciations can be added to
Alexa&rsquo;s expected vocabulary in order to allow several different approaches/commands to get the same
outcome/direction. As such, the API of OctoPrint must be learned and implemented into different Alexa skill
Intents so that they can be deployed and used on your Alexa enabled device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest roadblock we ran into during our development process was our ability to
gain communication from one device to the other. We finally solved this issue having a 3rd party service
communicate to the Raspberry-Pi and continually monitor the IP-address.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our Proudest Moment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to say &ldquo;Alexa, tell the 3D printer to auto-home&rdquo;. This was when all our eyes lit up and
there were high fives all around. This was the very first command we were able to have the 3D printer
execute by simply giving a vocalized command to Alexa. This was the point that we really knew that the idea was viable, and we now had a process by which we could create and add new features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came into this project with little to no experience in AWS, Alexa Skills, REST API calls, HTTP Requests, OctoPrint, server management, and I'm sure a lot of other things. But coming out of the hackathon, we each are a lot more comfortable with those skills. Being exposed to these ideas in a baptism by fire method allowed us to thrive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next for Printed Word
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We see the skills we have taught Alexa being the very beginning of what is possible if this
avenue was further explored. Having the conversation with Alexa being more fluid and adaptable would
be very beneficial to grow the possibilities of this voice-to-3D-print idea. The ability for one with very
limited knowledge in 3D printing to be able to access this rapidly growing technology with the benefit of
their home assistant is a solid step towards the ubiquity of 3D printing, at-home manufacturing, and
industrial applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next major step to adding functionality to this hack would be to add access to the well-known content website Thingiverse. This is a social website where users can share their 3D model
creations with the Internet. The end result would be to give the user the ability to tell Alexa to print their
last &ldquo;favorited&rdquo; 3D model. Thingiverse has an in-depth API that gives us access to user info and controls
similar to the OctoPrint API. Being able to favorite a post on a website, and then telling your home
assistant to print that object is quite literally taking out multiple steps in order to receive a 3D printed
object.
