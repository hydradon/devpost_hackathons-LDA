                    Health plays a very important role in everyone&rsquo;s life, but healthcare is an expensive affair. The aging population in the world needs to invest a lot of time and money in going to hospitals and diagnostic centers to get checkups and tests done regularly. A lot of people are involved in taking care of an aged person, including nurses at home and close family members.

                    Medical tracking using the latest technology is growing stronger every day. We believe that our senior loved ones, while beginning to adopt technology, probably haven&rsquo;t yet gotten familiar with some great technology apps that can help them track and improve their health and wellness.

                    Research indicates that, even with the abundance of available health monitoring apps at our fingertips, our seniors (and even we ourselves) are still primarily using their heads or paper to track and trend their health data.

                    This ground reality motivates us to build a novel, easy-to-use emergency monitoring and reporting system that can connect the senior citizens and there care takers remotely. By just minimum intervention from the senior citizens, this system attempts to automatically report the patient&rsquo;s day-to-day activities and emergency information so that the responsible health providers can take proper urgent actions for the aged people.
