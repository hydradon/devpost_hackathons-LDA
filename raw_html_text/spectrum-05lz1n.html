                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication is changing fundamentally. For hundreds of millions of people, video selfies are now the default form of communication. This is also a natural and authentic way to communicate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, current customer service and user feedback mechanisms still require typing, making it a hassle to leave feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Companies are missing out on high-quality feedback data which is very valuable for them to gain an understanding of how their customers really feel.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spectrum turns in-app/website feedback buttons into video experiences that allow customers to relay their message in a natural, in-the-moment format. A business could embed our button anywhere on their site.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pasha tackled the front end and some of the backend, while Suzie worked on integration and analysis of uploaded videos by Affectiva.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was really challenging to nail down the pitch. We had 1000 ideas on how to explain the value proposition and the importance of authenticity in feedback, eventually cutting it down to 60 seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got a working product that other developers will be able to test out for themselves. It's also a feasible business.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teamwork is the best. Narrow down the mission statement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Spectrum
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that companies with a similar mission catch on to the value of video and implement it in their offerings.
