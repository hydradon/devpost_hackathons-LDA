                <p>
                    When the user calls our phone number, they can choose the social situation that they would like to practise, the options are currently: job interviews, and smalltalk. Once they have selected one, they will be connected to a designated lexbot  that will simulate the conversation. The audio from this conversation will be stored and analysed and the user is texted a uuid of the conversation. The user cam then visit, the main site, and using their uuid review analytics of their conversations. They can practice as much as they want, wherever they are over the phone, and review the results later.

                    We used the nexmo api for the number and used their lex connector to connect to a lexbot. 
Microsoft cognitive services was used for sentiment analysis and key phrase detection.
The webhooks in this project and main website were hosted from a nodejs server.
Google speech api was used for audio-text conversion to allow transcription and analysis.
