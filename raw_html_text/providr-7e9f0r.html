                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members had decided to use her birthday money to help out charities in need. However, the process was difficult. She had to reach out to the charities to ask them what supplies they needed. Then, when they finally reached out, she had to order the supplies to her own home, and figure out how to send it to charities abroad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another one of our team members noted that her parents often didn't donate much to charity because they didn't know how their money was being spent. Was their money only being used for advertisements and paying volunteers, or was it actually helping those in need?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that could make the donating process more simple, and make the donating more direct.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ProvidR allows a simple platform to donate items such as food, blankets, clothes, and school supplies to charities all around the world. The donating process can be done in the comfort of your own home. Charities can put out "tasks," such as "donate three blankets for [name]." Users of the app can choose tasks to complete, and can earn points when these tasks are completed.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made prototypes of the pages of the app with sketch and we translated that into XCode.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most difficult things of this project was that we had a clear end goal, we knew exactly how we wanted our app to work, but it was a challenge to reach there. We wanted our donors to be able to discover new charities in need, but we were beginners to computer programming. Therefore, we first needed to figure out how the code worked before we could innovate ideas of how we would implement the code into our idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how we worked together as a team. Everyone had a job / role, and we shared and collaborated ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also proud of our idea itself. We think that more people would find it easier to donate with this app, and would therefore donate more. Our app has the potential to help those in need, and can create a real difference.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we need to start with a plan / broad idea. Next time, we will map out our end goal, and the steps we should take to achieve it. Proper organization will minimize loss of time and allow us to develop more code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ProvidR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make the donating process even more straightforward. We want to pursue a partnership with Amazon so that donors don't have to even ship supplies to their own homes. Instead, supplies can be shipped directly to the headquarters of the charity.
