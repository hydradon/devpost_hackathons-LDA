                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From tutoring in schools we noticed kids often don't know the proper way to write letters and as a result their work can be untidy, we wanted to make a tool that could help them improve while being more interesting than a school workbook
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prompts kids to trace a capital letter and then calculates a percentage to represent how accurate the child was in tracing the letter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Was coded in Python using the tkinter graphics package. Analyzed the geometric composition of each of the capital letters in the alphabet and then formulated an algorithm for comparing the points of the composed letters to those the kids draw. Then used the normal model to convert this comparison into a percentage.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Memory allocation of the floating point representations of each of the points generated. 
Front-end graphics. 
Compatibility with imported packages.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How well the program can detect correctly drawn capital letters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We were working on implementing a handwriting to text application based on the functions in the current Jungle Scribe
