                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tick-Talk was created to help the user improve their public speaking skills. We wanted to create something that could listen to you talk and identify areas that you can improve on, such as controlling speed and clarity of speech.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When navigating to the web-app, the user can click a button that starts recording your voice. When you're done, you can click another button to stop recording, then submit it to Google Cloud's API for Speech-to-Text. Both the speech and analysis is displayed in text below!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our backend was written using node/express, and our frontend was written partially with Vue, but some parts were purely HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not end up having enough time to connect our nicer Vue frontend to our backend, which resulted in a plain html page. Also, we should have figured out how to accept audio buffers as parameters to our audio analysis function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us came into this project without any knowledge on how to use node, express, Vue, nor the APIs. We took this opportunity to learn more about writing web apps and using Google Cloud APIs, and we accomplished that!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to host a web server using node, connect javascript files to the server file using express, and how to perform API requests to convert our audio files into text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Tick-Talk
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the frontend to our backend, and adding upload audio file functionality to our site!
