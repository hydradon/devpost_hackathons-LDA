                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the crisis of food wastage has been growing. we were disturbed to find out that this crisis is also happening in our school and there is little that is done to curb the problem. hence we aimed to reduce the food wastage in NUS by targeting the meal plan system at residential colleges' dining halls as we believe that we can make the most impact there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    users can log on to submit their choices of meals based on the planned menu every two weeks. Vendors can then obtain the information and prepare food portions more accordingly to the demand.
                </p>
