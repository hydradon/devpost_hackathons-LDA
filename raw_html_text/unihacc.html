                    As we depend on more and more sites, our bookmarks bar is getting very cluttered with links. In addition, for students and employees alike, DeClutter will reduce the amount of navigation required to get to a certain link.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DeClutter is a chrome extension which allows users to manage "groups", each of which have their own aliases and corresponding hyperlinks (see image 1). For example, a university student might have the group COMP1511 with aliases such as Lecture notes (URL would be a link to lecture notes), Lab (Link to Lab manual/excercises) and tute (link to tute sheets). As it is not limited to university courses, this extension can be used for personal and corporate organisation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A combination of buttons and texts fields obtain data from the user. Add and remove buttons allow for customisation of the extension. Favicons to make the links much more user friendly. The system will sync with the user's account on chrome using chrome.storage, and hence is accessible on any machine provided correct settings are enabled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program has been implemented using js and html. Various functions such as displayGroup and closeSubmit ensure the user is navgiated correctly through the extension and their preferences are stored.
