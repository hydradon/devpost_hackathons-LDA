                <p>
                    Provide an easy free way for homeless to find opportunities and make collecting data easy for workers through the API.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application has a elegant UI that is easy to understand and use. Once an existing member signs in, they are given multiple options to gain information about transportation, work, medical, and housing. The application will store information about what most concerns the homeless through which options that they are clicking most with the power of API's. New user's can easily sign up through the main page. Admin's can log into the app and configure graphs with the data collected.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first started the project by collecting our thoughts into one and drawing out an outline of what we wanted. Once we collected our thoughts, we divided the work evenly within the team. We used Android Studio for the entire project using multiple dependencies to implement the API's, Google Maps, and the local database.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent the first two hours trying to configure how to use android studio with git. immediately after solving the git riddle, the application started crashing. We realized this was do to how we implemented the API and decided to start implementing a small database on the phone. Obviously, this brought in multiple difficulties that took hours to solve. The biggest difficulty that we ran into was to make a very simple elegant design for the UI.

                    We are proud of our abilities to

                    </strong>
                    through the frustrations of working with code that constantly fights against you with all it's might. Till at the mighty end, you have won the war.

                <p>
                    The basic structuring of API's and how to implement them within an android application. How to manipulate the UI with greater precision and how to build a database within the system.

                    For version 2, we would like to integrate more analytical analysis within the app for the admins.
