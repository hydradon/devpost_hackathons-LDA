                    Originally came up with this idea as a joke, but I figured why not; create a robot that attempts to write poetry, then laugh at what it prints out!

                    POEtry-slam-bot is an aspiring poet who is well-versed in the literature of Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, and William Blake. He submitted a few of his works and its up to you to judge if his verse is good enough to be immortalized in Project Gutenberg.

                    I can't make a GUI to save my life so a command-line interface will have to do. Otherwise parsing input text with RegEx was probably the most challenging part of the project since different texts had different formatting.
