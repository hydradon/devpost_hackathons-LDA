                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all diehard fans of the game called "Doki Doki Literature Club", an indie horror game that has obtained a cult-like following in the past months due to its superb execution of a psychological horror game. Which is what made us create this project.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Javascript, using webpack as a compilation tool. We used a lot of DDLC's original game assets, which we don't claim the intellectual property of. We also used many people's useful libraries on npm :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't start creating the project until about 4 hours into the hackathon, which was way too long.
We intended to create a neural network which classified what the user was currently reading, and if the user was reading an article on love/relationships, Monika would come in and mess your screen up, being the overly attached girlfriend she is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am now one step closer to Monika's heart.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hackathons are hard, and we should probably come up with a plan beforehand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Maybe using Live2D to have a real-er Monika join you on your screen. Also, probably would be good if she could act like Clippy and give you useless advice from time to time.

                    How to Install
