                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Space is cool. We were reminded of this by the solar eclipse in 2017, and we never wanted to miss something like that again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program sends emails using the Java Mail API about upcoming astronomical events scraped from in-the-sky.org using Jsoup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in Java with the intent of packaging it as an Android app, but ultimately we ran out of time to make the android app. It is still built using Java and libraries like Jsoup, Java Mail, and JAF.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Android Dev from the ground up with basically no knowledge of how to handle dependencies, run different threads, or even use XML on a basic level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing with a functional project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about APIs, Android Studio, Web Scraping and just generally how to learn quickly and on-the-fly. Some specific details we learned about Android Studio include the implementation of CardViews, Calendars, and Loaders.

                    What's next for Sky Notify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the Android App we worked on, and adding features like getting events for certain dates.
