                    Mealquest generates recipes for meals based on a user's input. Sample inputs could be budget, dietary restrictions, calories per complete meal serving, time allowed for cooking, food category desired, and more. This will be a completely free service for end-users, and instead targeted at supermarkets/grocery stores in B2B sales as a value-adding service.

                <p>
                    I ran into some issues planning my database, and how each entity would relate to each other. Additionally, constructing my development guideline and planning how I wanted to start proved challenging as I have never developed anything like this before. Fortunately Jesse and Bill from Drips, and Brian from FeneTech were very helpful! Thank you again!

                    What I've Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into this project, I knew very basic C# revolving around Windows Forms template. Learning MVC, Razor, and more about .NET has been a great learning experience, and I am excited to continue working on this project.

                    Future Plans!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Data-wise:
    Create a web crawler in Python to gather data rather than manually finding and enter data.
    Migrate database to MS SQL Server.
Add onto:
More parameters for searching (such as alcohol pairings).
More options for current variables (food categories, dietary restrictions, etc).
UI &ndash; continue to improve user experience.
Introduce:
Ranges rather than static variables.
Fitness calculator to calculate daily macros for weight gain/loss.
Macros for meals for fitness tracking.
Adapt for other &ldquo;DIY&rdquo; stores &ndash; Home Depot, Lowes, ACE, etc.
