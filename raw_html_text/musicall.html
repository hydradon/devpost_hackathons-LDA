                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were playing music one day, but realized that the music was pretty quiet. So we thought, "Why don't we use multiple people's speakers?" We wanted a cheap and easy surround sound system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One device can connect to multiple (up to 7) devices and send them music files to play via Bluetooth. When using the seek bar, all the phones will seek to the same place in the music at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MediaPlayer to play the music and Bluetooth to send from the server to multiple clients at once. We made our own communication protocol between the devices to send files and seek messages reliably.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making multiple Bluetooth connections work at once was difficult. We also had to decide how to send both music files and messages over Bluetooth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made all the components work reliably and the music syncs together pretty well. We were able to find some time to sleep as well!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More Android features!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Musicall
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll make the app more reliable and add even more features to it, such as a playlist maybe.
