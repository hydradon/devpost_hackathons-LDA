                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've been learning Python on my own throughout the semester, but this is the first time I've used Pygame.  I wanted to develop something graphical, because I've actually never done that before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It plays out Conway's Game of Life based on an initial User Inputted Grid
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created images to use in animations that I wrote using Pygame.  I used the Pygame documentation and an explanation of the Game of Life to help me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding how to create animations in Pygame, and building the game itself were difficult.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    Building something in a way that I've never done before!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Pygame, and more Python skills in general.
                </p>

                    What's next for Game of Life in Pygame
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm going to try to make other games in Pygame that are more complicated and look better.
