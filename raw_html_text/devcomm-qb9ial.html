                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nigeria is currently having a technology boom and we have communities growing rapidly. The primary locations so far have been Lagos and Abuja yet we are aware that talent is very well distributed across the country but other locations have been hard to reach or maintain a proper network and community of passionate people. These people have missed out on tremendous opportunities and we aim to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DevComm is a directory of these techies with their various locations across the country to help facilitate networking and community building anywhere in the entire country. DevComm also aims to help people/event organizers promote events and opportunities to any part of the country which would have been rather difficult to reach without the use of DevComm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app is built on React for the front-end and Laravel as the API. We went with Mailgun to send promotional emails. We decided to have people sign up and add up their specialty and location to sort people into communities by their states. These people can then easily view each other's details and other social media details to be able to connect even outside the platform. We have promotions where anyone can share event details and opportunities to members of these communities that match their desired audience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had the idea for this solution really late hence we started with little time left. It was my first time using React and we were following a different approach till we had technical difficulties and decided it best to separate the front end with the API installation in Laravel. One of our major challenges was ensuring we don't overthink this and keep the solution simple yet effective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got to try out React for the first time and it's amazing. Despite getting into the project with only a few weeks left, I managed to get it done despite tight work schedules and got set on a path to solving a big problem in our community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt that the community is way bigger than ourselves. And the value of a good network cannot be overstated. I also got to use React for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DevComm
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe we are solving a problem, and we would continue to build on this amazing solution and improve on it. We hope in a matter of months, we would be able to reach talent across all states in Nigeria and have them all connected to the larger ecosystem. It'll become easier to organize meetups and get access to incredible opportunities. So regardless of the results of this competition, this is a solution we believe in and are dedicated to connecting technical talent all across Nigeria.
