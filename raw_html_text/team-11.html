                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main force of the Junior Achievement program is comprised of volunteers, however the process for signing up is very slow and complicated, which causes too many volunteers to fall off. Since the participation of community members is crucial to the functionality of Junior Achievement, we've decided to find a way to make it easier for volunteers to find the right program for them in a quick and efficient manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to expedite the process, we've decided to modify their website to display a list of volunteer opportunities. This eliminates the need to wait for the Education manager to look through the list of volunteer interests to select a program for them. Instead, the volunteers can search for volunteer opportunities that they are interested in, saving them time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Junior Achievement website is built using Wordpress, so we integrated some custom HTML and JavaScript code to access a Firebase database and pull the list of volunteer opportunities to display on the page. We also included a filter so that the searches can be more specialized to only display the opportunities that the volunteer wants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our team had never used Firebase or Wordpress before, so we needed to constantly learn new technologies as we went. Wordpress especially limited our options for web development as opposed to regular HTML, and Firebase was different from the MySQL databases that we are familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create the front-end to display a table of volunteer opportunities, and the filtered searches to filter out relevant results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Wordpress plugins and their functionality, and we were exposed to Firebase for the first time. In addition, we tried using the Google Maps API to display the volunteering locations on a map for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Team 11
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to fully implement the Firebase usage and add the Google Maps functionality into the app. Following that, we might also think about making it easier for administrators to update the database more easily, so that they can keep the website up to date.
