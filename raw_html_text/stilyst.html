                <p>
                    I always found difficulty figuring out what to wear even if it is for a friend's party or a cultural event at work. I always solicited help from friends who had some good fashion sense and I eventually discovered that it is in fact something many others face.

                    For example, John is heading out for a very important meeting at work but his work is quite casual. John wanted to know how he can look both sharp and classy since it's a meeting. John goes on to the platform and hires Casey, a freelance stylist for $30 per hour. They get on a call and John shows Casey his wardrobe. Casey gives John a few options on what he could possibly wear. John loves one of her options and tries it out and loves the style she recommended. John felt more confident than usual and everyone loved his presentation. You know what they say, Dress to impress!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the above example, it's a win-win for both John and Casey. John had to pay a few bucks to get the best out of his wardrobe and felt more confident while Casey made some money and built her reputation as a budding fashion designer.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it's a 24-hour hackathon, my highest priority was to get the wireframes right. But it took longer than I expected to frame the problem statement and start coding. I used 'Marvel app' to build the wireframes and used a template from Supernova to export it into a Flutter app and played around with the code on VS Code. The rest of the time was spent connected to my phone and running numerous tests to build something substantial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My laptop could not handle Android Studio + Supernova + Spotify + Chrome(marvel app) together and I ran into issues again and again because of that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, working alone, it was very difficult to brainstorm, sketch, build and test out everything by myself!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took a while to sketch the wireframes and then build them using the Marvel App. Although I could not build the complete app, I'll still use the wireframes to constantly work on the app even after the hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how difficult it is to actually set up stuff to work(android studio, flutter, supernova). This is the first time I build an android app and it felt very good(although I couldn't finish building it). The first time I connected my phone in debugging mode and saw the app pop up, I actually forgot that I had been up all night!
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea seems very interesting and I also spoke to about 10 people including a few hackathon participants and found out that this is a widespread problem. I'm really excited about the idea and am going to take it forward and build the damn thing.
