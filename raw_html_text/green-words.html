                    How I built it

                    I used Eclipse.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my fifth attempt at a project. This Hackathon has thought me that I have a lot to learn about software development outside of the classroom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got experience with and feel more comfortable with Java, and its libraries, GitHub, and web crawler algorithms (my previous project attempt). I'm also glad that despite it's challenges I was able to have fun at this Hackathon.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I am free to learn a team if their ideals don't align with my own.

                <p>
                    I may make it into a Google Chrome Tab Extension/app.
