                    Our project, Shade aims to encrypt and decrypt user data in order to make it more secure. We do this by utilizing a both Diffie-Hellman key exchange and steganography.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Diffie-Hellman is a process where the two parties exchanging information start with a common key. Then both parties each have a secret key for themselves which they will mix with the common key. There should be two different keys. Then the keys are exchange and are combined with the same secret key for each person in order to obtain the common secret key. Our Diffie-Hellman procedure uses images and the rgb values of them (in binary) as keys.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Steganography is the process of hiding a message or file within another message or file. In our project, we chose to hide a message within one of the images we obtained during our previous Diffie-Hellman process. In order to do this, we took the rgb values of the image in binary and whenever there was a '1' in the value it would get replaced with one bit of the message (which was also already converted to binary). Whenever there was  a '0', it would be replaced with 0 or 1 randomly. When the binary value of the message is shorter than the binary rgb values of the image, there will be a padding of 2 bytes of 0's which acts as a buffer. Then there will again be random 0's or 1's until it reaches the end of the image length.
