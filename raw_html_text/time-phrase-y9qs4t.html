                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The other day I was at my cousin's place where my aunt was just done with teaching my cousin how to read time. At that time I realized that they might have been skipping some major aspect of reading/interpreting time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill shouts some random time phrases which the child is expected to tell it back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With all the hard work and patience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since I did not had Echo, it was quite tough for me to test skill with the actual user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After I gave demo for this video, 5 of my neighbors ordered echo right there. They were so impressed with the concept that they couldn't resist. On looking at the usage of this skill, they were so happy that now their child can practice time anytime. Someone apart from them would be able to help assist their child learn time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with AWS lambda. How Alexa could be beneficial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Time Phrase
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Will add more cases where children can not only answer the questions but get hints, learn more about time. I also plan to roll out a version for Echo Show as well for better understanding.
