                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app data-centric, which that means all the data on Homeless people and the care facilities will be easily available, With the data, we ran some analytics to prevent the Homelessness. Any CoC can integrate with our system and they can provide all the help for Homeless people effectively. We integrated all CoC data to be accessible to all participating CoC's to effectively help Homeless people. homeless people with service providers to improve tracking and provide better service through analytics.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have one of our Team mate(Front End Developer role) to leave on Saturday morning, because of a family emergency(which is very unfortunate). Since we wanted to build our app data-centric we faced  challenges in data cleansing, designing, and how to get data into our systems to better address the issue. We have faced some issues with UI development, integrating overall workflow.
