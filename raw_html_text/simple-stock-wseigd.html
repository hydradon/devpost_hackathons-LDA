                    Investing is a complex process, so we wanted to make understanding stocks a much, much simpler process. With Simple-Stock, we provide stock metrics in plain English that people can use to make decisions on their stock positions.

                    Historically, regular folks have gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to investing information. A 2011 study by Griffin et al. demonstrated that retail investors, individual investors, continued to pour money into the 2000s dot-com bubble market, even after it was apparent that the whole market was tanking hard. Large institutional investors with more market information, on the other hand, exited their positions faster and protected relatively much more of their capital. This asymmetrical information flow caused many people to lose their livelihoods.

                    With time, market information has become more symmetrical, but this information is either theory spread out through many pages, or an over-over-simplification that causes people to over rely on professional analyst predictions. Web resources such as Investopedia, SeekingAlpha and Wall Street Survivor got created to educate people and share ideas about the methods of investing in different sorts of asset classes, be it stocks, bonds, options, futures, forex, etc. However, unless people already invest their time into researching stocks, their time is better spent elsewhere. Additionally, some sites provide esoteric information about analyst predictions, usually in the form of "Sell," "Hold," and "Buy". If people act upon these recommendations, they have autonomy in physically dealing with stocks, but they rest their overall decision to deal on those analysts.

                    Overall, Simple-Stock strives to provide a balance between too-much and too-little information. We respect people's time, and we respect that they have better things to do. So we give them information that they understand and can act upon on quickly.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Type in the stock symbol of a company of interest, for example, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) or Proctor &amp; Gamble (PG). The program will output a historical chart of prices, which the user can toggle through (1-year, 2-year, 3-year history). Additionally, there are valuation seven metrics that appear, with a "True" or "False" rating. Generally and relatively, true is good, false is bad. The plain english explanations are available on the read-me at the moment
