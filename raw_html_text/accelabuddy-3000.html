                    Inspiration: Rehabilitation is the path through which many patients suffering injuries are brought back to their daily routine. For a person just recovering from such an accident, efficient and interactive rehabilitation can repair both their physical and mental wounds they would have incurred.

                    What it does: Our robot is an attempt to improve

                <p>
                    fine motor skills for those who have suffered injuries (mental or physical) by a fun and interactive interface to control the robot. Our system converts the tilt gestures of the user into 2 axis movement of the robot. This gesture data is sent to the robot over RF.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it: We have two arduinos, one converts the gestures into proper tilt data and it is sent to the robot over RF. This is converted into motor outputs by the second arduino.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: accessing the data from the IMU, communicating with the NRF240L and converting IMU data into tilt movemets , converting tilt into motor movements.
