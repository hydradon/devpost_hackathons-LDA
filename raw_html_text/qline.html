                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, the queue line to get help from TAs is created on a whiteboard at the front of a room at the beginning of each help session. Students must go to the whiteboard and write their names by hand to add their names to the queue. TAs must walk back to the board every time they want to erase a name. The whole process is cumbersome and time-consuming.

                    QLine is a website that lists all the TA hours and creates digital queue lines for each TA help session. Students can add their names by typing into the appropriate box. All authorized users can see who's in the queue line.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing real time data is very hard. Integrating and updating information constantly in coordination with multiple users is extremely hard. In addition, there is a steep learning curve for learning integrative API's or Flask and databases such as SQL. Working in multiple languages is hard.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding additional capabilities for administrators/TAs, like viewing statistics about the TA session.
Making sure that students can only remove their own name - no cutting in line!
Optimizing the website for mobile devices and/or creating an accompanying app.
