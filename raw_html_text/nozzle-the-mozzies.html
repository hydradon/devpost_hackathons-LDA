                    The problem that my team is seeking to solve is the spread of disease via mosquitoes and the general irritation that goes along with mosquitoes. The main solution that my team has come up with to solve this problem is a multidisciplinary solution. We will combine the talent, strength weaknesses of all of us to come up with a grand solution to a grand challenge. We will use the ideas from Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science and applied Mathematics to come up with a way to localised the solution to getting rid of mosquitoes. We cannot simply kill all the mosquitoes at Callaghan campus. The way we will use computer science, applied mathematics and Statistics is by using clever AI video systems. If we place these cameras in places where we know there is a abundant amount people walking through then we can analyse what these people are doing. This camera will pick up the mannerism and actions of the people and hopefully what it will show us is the places on campus where people are wacking themselves or waving there hands in the air to get rid of mosquitoes. This will then allow us to utilise our limited resources to the maximum benefit. By being able to know where there are great numbers of mosquitoes based on peoples action ie (wacking themselves to get rid of the mosquitoes) we can place flytraps and mosquito zappers in these areas. These devices can then be powered via solar cells, perhaps we could use the solar cells developed by the centre for organic electronics. We can also place these solar cells to power these machines on the most optimal places by getting a solar quote. Therefore we limit the ongoing cost of there localised solutions. At these places where we have found that there is the greatest number of mosquitoes based on people wacking themselves we can also place Aeroguard and signs to encourage people to wear long sleeve clothing and to avoid certain areas. Now our biological solution is to go to the source of the mosquito, zap traps should be placed near the creek where the main source of mosquitoes come from in such a way that stops them from coming on to campus if possible this can then be done in a sustainable way by powering the zap traps again by using solar energy and we can also use battery storage for all this technology so that any excess energy is put back into the system. The AI technology relies on using iCetana which is a camera that uses AI video analytics for automatic real time critical event detection. By using this technology we can set up/replace all camera on campus and install more and then use this technology to detect people wacking themselves due to being bitten by flies. In the areas we find that people are being bitten the most we can put the most resources towards. By using statistics we can find the following, at what time are there the most amount of people walking through say a particular thoroughfare and at what time do we see the most amount of people being bitten. Therefore this would allow us to use the zap traps power by the centre for organic electronics solar cells at the time when they are most needed. This would also tell us where to place free bottles of Aeroguard where people will most need it/use it. This will mean we can make the most use of our very limited resources. So the first experiment will be using the iCetena camera and setting it up in a heavily used thoroughfare record the number of student walking past and how many times such students are attacked by Mozzies, using this data we have collected we can then decide on how to set up our prevention method. If we know statistically where the Mozzies are flying from to get to the thoroughfare we can then use zap traps to block there entry and set up Aeroguard stands at a place where all people will be able to readily access it. We can also then set up our COE powered solar cells and buy solar batteries to make these zaptraps/flytraps sustainable. If we are successful with this prevention method in this particular thoroughfare then we will then role out these cameras and prevention methods to the whole campus. This funding would be used to buy the cameras and solar batteries, the solar panels could be supplied by the COE and the Aeroguard could be supplied by the University. In our experiment where we have identified an area where there is alot of Mosquitoes via the iCetena cameras we can also set up Mortein coils and using fans to blow the this scent in the direction of the mozzies. This would then be another cost. I believe this would all be under $5,000 dollars and if we contacted iCetena and told them of our plan to retrograde there cameras for a new use I think they would be happy to work with us free of charge and perhaps they would actually provide assistance. So our testing phase will allow us to know if this technique will work or not. If we can indeed have a targeted localised solution to areas we actually detect people being bitten by mozzies using AI technology, we can also then place these cameras near the nest of the mozzies and discern where people are being bitten through the cameras. Then we can use the prevention methods as listed before and power them using solar power from the COE and battery storage perhaps say from Elon Musk and none of this would cost much money because perhaps they would like to see if this is actually practicals otherwise it will be a very limited cost under $5000. This is unconventional because we are using AI technology to tell us the areas people are actually being bitten to and then using applied maths, comp sci and stats to tell us the optimal places where we should place prevention methods as listed before.
