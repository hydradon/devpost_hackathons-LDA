                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first year college students, one of the biggest issues we face is managing our mental health. Out schools attempt to express it's significance and urge us to make sure we are cognoscente of it, but do not give us tools to track and manage it. Many first years are also busy, on the go students who don't have time to sit down and journal,so we need another efficient and reliable way to keep track of our mental health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa Feels asks the user about its day. The information that the user tells Alexa is placed in the Amazon database that is connected with the user's identification in which they are able to access in order to keep track of their mental progressions over time. Alexa, in return for their information about their day, will give the user words of wisdom and emotional support to get them to continue leading a positive life.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This built using Amazon Alexa Custom Skill Developer that utilized AWS Lambda Management for the front end development, JavaScript for the back end development, and Dynamo Database to connect and store information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of challenges was implementing JavaScript since it was not a language we were accustomed to. Another challenge was we had never dealt with Voice Assistance before, so we had to learn and comprehend the topics and skills involved with making a successful and useful Voice Assistant tool.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest accomplishment the ability to store data for the individual accounts on Amazon through Alexa. We had not interacted with Alexa's tools and software, so we spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to connect it to the Amazon database and insert information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest things we learned is that being willing and open to asking help and relying on our teammates can allow for a more progressive and collaborative experience. We learned that each of us held different strengths, and that using those strengths and getting support for the weaknesses was the best was to accomplish our goal and to learn as much as possible.

                </h2>
                <p>
