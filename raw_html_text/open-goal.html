                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Open Goal is a project created by avid FIFA and Football Manager players aiming to blend core gameplay concepts from both into a single game. This hackathon, we fleshed out a Unity concept of some of our ideas. It wasn't as serious as we would have liked, but then again this was the result of a literal 27 hours of work--not even the full hackathon time as we wasted a bunch of time messing with Unreal Engine at the beginning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our mission, really, is more focused on making well-crafted game mechanics that aren't as "gamified" as, say, FIFA, but without making it a literal simulation of real-life soccer. We consider well-crafted mechanics to be more important than graphics, animations, and timely releases. However, for this project, we just focused on making a playable soccer simulation game with some semblance of tactics and AI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did a mad dash of terribly documented, terribly organized Unity code using as many presets as we possibly could. We pretty much bootlegged together every component of the game and somehow we came up with something people really enjoyed playing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not knowing how Unity works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a game that a bunch of our friends found really amusing to play.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use Unity instead of Unreal Engine. Slide tackle instead of run.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Open Goal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a lot of interest in continuing to develop this project, possibly in future hackathons or just in our spare time.
