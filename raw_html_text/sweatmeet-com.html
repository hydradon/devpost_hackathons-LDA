                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A large number of people in big cities would like to enjoy sports activities but don&rsquo;t have enough connections or people to play and engage with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I personally experienced this problem when I first came to the U.S. I wasn&rsquo;t able to find anyone to play ping-pong with. Even now when I want to find someone to go to the mountains to ski it&rsquo;s a problem. Every time I want to involve myself in a sports situation, I don&rsquo;t want to do it alone, and I keep wishing there was an app like this to find someone.  And I am sure my situation is not unique, I think almost everybody faces this issue, especially if you are new in the city.
                </p>
