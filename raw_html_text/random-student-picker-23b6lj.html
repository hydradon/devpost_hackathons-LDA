                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My mom is a middle school teacher, and she wanted something like this. Her students sometimes don't feel like engaging in class, and this helps her encourage them to do so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The teacher can log into the
                    <a href="https://pickon.me" rel="nofollow">
                        website
                    </a>
                    and input class lists, organized by class period number. Then they can ask their Amazon Echo... "ask random student for period (n)". Alexa will announce a name at random.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Authentication and database are built as microservices on Firebase. Alexa code is running on Lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Account linking between Firebase and Alexa isn't supported out of the box, so I had to build my own OAuth flow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        APL is still a work in progress, so some parts of its documentation and implementation were difficult to understand.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Calling Firebase from Lambda can be slow if you don't optimize your code and make sure that your functions stay "warm".
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've built an OAuth account linking flow for Firebase, which I might be able to publish in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APL, Firebase, OAuth. I also learned about FERPA and what my users might have to be aware of, at least in the US.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Random Student Picker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to do some general cleanup, as well as publishing versions for mobile and other voice assistants. Might try to monetize somehow. I also want to make the invocation name and other verbiage more generic, since this could have applications outside of the classroom.
