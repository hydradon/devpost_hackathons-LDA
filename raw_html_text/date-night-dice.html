                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since Valentines' Day is right around the corner, we thought to make an app with the theme of romance in mind.  This led us through a few ideas for apps, before somebody brainstormed that the app should tell you what date you can go on, the rest was history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UI takes inputs from the user, and adds them to a list for possible activities. Then it takes inputs from the user for a list of locations.  After both lists have 6 possibilities (like dice) it shuffles them together and prints out your perfect spontaneous date.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote code for all the activities in Java, then formatted the pages using xml, and added graphics that were custom made in ms paint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nobody in our group has any prior experience with mobile development or Android studio.  Initially, we ran into a lot of problems understanding how the formatting with xml linked in with the java code for the functionality.  Many resources that were provided by HackBU online were immensely helpful to our success in this regard.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since nobody has had any experience with any mobile development, one of the best feelings of the night was loading the app onto the virtual phone, clicking a button to go to the next page, then having the next page actually load up.  The feeling of accomplishment in that moment made the near 10 hours leading up to it completely worth it.  After this, getting any app that ended up working was just awesome!  Let alone the app that we planned on getting the whole time, as well as having it look so good as well

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about mobile development, how hard it is, and the advantages of using android studio with xml and java.  This exposure for us was a really big step up in our understanding of how mobile development works
