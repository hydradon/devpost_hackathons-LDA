                    Vertical Gardens are a upmoving concept in our cities and there is a big interest in knowing what you eat. The growing food culture and the will to have clean and green cities with fresh air is not ignorable.
We build a platform which helps you in the first place to classify your roof and afterwards find the best plants to grow there. You can also buy/sell local foods directly from/to your neighbour.
We used the LIDER-Data to classify the roofs of the cities. Moreover we match the existing roofs with specific agriculture.
