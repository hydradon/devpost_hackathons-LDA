                <p>
                    UX/UI articles and the inclination to tackle the Food4Kids website challenge

                <p>
                    Interacts with the user when upon selecting the donation page; they are able to see their value donation go through with a safe and secure transaction as well as a grocery transaction with visible impact shown through the cart and the donation donut graph.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end design was created through Adobe XD and the coding for the website itself was done through HTML, javascript, and bootstrap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The implementation of bootstrap on the front end was tough because we had to use the design elements already given to us (the branding was pre-determined so the project had to be paralleled to that)
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned about design for donors while upholding the organization's branding; bootstrap; Adobe XD; and overall programming

                <p>
                    More pages for the website to make the donation experience more fun and interactive; the donors will enjoy the experience and share it with their peers
