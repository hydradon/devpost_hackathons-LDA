                    Whilst holidaying in the countryside I found it incredibly easy to get to sleep. Could it be the fresh unpolluted air, the all the holiday booze or possibly the long walks across the mountains. Perhaps but I can&rsquo;t take all that back to modern life. So I&rsquo;ll have to settle on the relaxing sound of sheep.

                    The skill provides a series of bleating sheep to count. The delay before the sheep bleats matches the speed at which you respond, so as your responses become less immediate the delay before the bleat increases. This should match your tempo and gradually encourage you to relax.

                    I had initially worried about finding non-hilarious sheep sounds that didn&rsquo;t sound like humans pretending to be sheep. But after listening to real sheep it turns out they sound like humans pretending to be sheep anyway!

                    Unfortunately my computer took a dirt nap, I guess it spent to much time counting sheep, so now I&rsquo;m limited to mobile phones and a old laptop that resets itself at random intervals. Will I be able to finish typi

                    Whilst the skill is simple and perhaps rather silly, I am proud of the simplicity of the user interface.

                    I would very much like to add a visual element to the app, perhaps animated sheep jumping over a gate, but without a computer that seems a little unlikely to happen.
