                    is a micro-controller which interfaces with an Particle Boron LTE module, as well as a hygrometer, thermometer and barometer to give the user access to a variety of readings and calculations through an online portal. The system is connected to a portable battery pack and can function in most environments.

                    uses an Arduino Uno and Particle Boron LTE for sensor I/O and LTE connectivity respectively. 
The Uno is used to conglomerate sensor data from a barometer, thermometer and hygrometer, whose data is then sent via serial port to the Boron to allow for online connectivity.

                    The front end is a web application that implements Bootstrap and CanvasJS. The client can send requests for information to the Arduino through the Particle server, which updates the web UI with the relevant information. The user can also generate a graph with a history of the data points for that atmospheric parameter.

                <p>
                    During hardware integration, the team encountered technical difficulties getting the Boron to properly relay requests to the Uno, and returning the requested parameters. This was resolved through extensive troubleshooting to achieve a reliable hardware integration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the front end, issues were encountered using the CanvasJS library to generate graphical output of the information without ruining the existing UI formatting. The lightweight web application holds historical data on the client side and does not use a secondary server. While this is economical from the developer perspective, there were issues integrating JS scripts in the webpage. These were eventually debugged.
