                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from a former team member who had visited the RBC workshop and thought of predicting financial stability based on past financial data. After reading documentation of various APIs, we realized that TD's Da Vinci API was the optimal candidate for the vision we had for our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FinBetter makes understanding a person's financial history easier by suggesting a person's financial stability depending on how much of their income they spend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built FinBetter by retrieving a user's transaction history from customer IDs, sorting the transaction data by date, and graphing the person's net worth over transaction history.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After the other members of my team left the team, I was left at a loss for what I would do with the project. The front- and one of the backend hackers had just left and I attempted to build the core mechanics of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sorting TD's virtual user transactions by date, as well as determining the way data would be organized for a time series analysis in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about new APIs like TD's Da Vinci API, as well as some of the ways professionals analyze large amounts of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FinBetter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for FinBetter is implementing a prediction model to provide users a better experience with understanding their financial situation.
