                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bringing our idea of Earth day inspired games back in full circle, we made a hand controlled asteroids based game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players can utilize the ultrasonic sensor controller in order to move their in game avatar. The xy axis controller uses two ultrasonic sensor that creates velocity values that are used to move the player. Additionally, by motioning their hands in the forward direction, the players can activate the shooting mechanism that fires at the oncoming asteroids.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ultrasonic sensors and Arduino to get the position values values of the hand. We then transferred this data to python using Pyserial. Then, using Python and Pygame, we created a game that used the hand position as movement.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to incorporate multithreading to decrease the lag in reading. However, we did not have enough time to fully implement multithreading, so we scrapped it.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's functional not very laggy
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pygame plus pyserial causes a great amount of lag.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Earthcade v2.0
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to implement multithreading to fully eliminate the lag.
