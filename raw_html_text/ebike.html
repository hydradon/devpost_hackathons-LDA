                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Original micro controller on the brushless motor was Chinese garbage that didn't even have a reverse functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can control the specific parameters of the brushless motors; such as brake, curent, duty cycle, position, speed, and position.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soldering iron, wires, XT60 connectors, MIT's racecar ROS package.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges using right port for VESC, general bugs to get package to work with our setup.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    that it just works.

                <p>
                    not catch a fallng soldering iron

                    What's next for Ebike
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integrate it with a multiude of sensors for so that we can use sensor fusion for navigation.
