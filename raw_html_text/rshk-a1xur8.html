                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a useful project that would inform people about the dangers of earthquakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses IBM Watson to accurately give an estimate of damages and injuries of an earthquake that would occur today with a given magnitude &amp; location.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using data collected from US census bureau and earthquake data from NOAA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Watson proposed many challenges. Everything from getting the data into a consistent format to getting the files in the right place was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were actually able to connect front-end to back-end, which took us a number of hours but ended up working quite well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although AI tools are very effective, they are very difficult to use. Also, lots of data has to be used to make them accurate. If you specify too many or too little inputs, it can throw off the whole training process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RSHK
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The same approach can be used for any kind of natural disaster - hurricanes, wildfires, floods, anything that can be mitigated when people are educated about the dangers of such disasters. The data is definitely out there, it just needs to be used in the right way.
