                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking about how to play pong on an Arduino and were suggesting random things to do for this hackathon. 
We decided to use our collective coding skills to build a game, which none of us have had any prior experience in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Plays a game of "Snake"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We analysed the Oculus Rift sample file in order to understand how to write code for it, and then another part of our group worked on specific methods to implement the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had any prior experience in game development and very minimal knowledge in C++.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully debug and create a game of Snake using Oculus Rift VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Game development can be very difficult without a game engine, but can be extremely useful for visualizing data structures, like linked lists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VR Snake
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can use the knowledge that we gained from this project in order to make a much better game, hopefully with less limitations.
