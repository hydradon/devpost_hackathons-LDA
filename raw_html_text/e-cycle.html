                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Americans represent 5% of the world&rsquo;s population, but generates 30% of the world&rsquo;s garbage. In a lifetime, the average American will throw away 600 times his or her body weight, which for an average adult would leave a legacy of 90,000 pounds of trash at the end of their lifetime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Less than 2% of the total waste in the United States is recycled. Of these recyclables, Americans throw away enough aluminum to rebuild the entire commercial air fleet every three months, enough steel to reconstruct Manhattan, and enough wood to heat 5 million homes for 200 years. U.S. waste disposal costs exceed $100 billion annually.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app incentivizes users to increase their recycling efforts by offering potential earnings on the sale of both standard and raw recyclable materials
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were are able to make this  crossplatform application by using javascript, html, css, android studio, amazon web services , braintree, Here mapping, and we also made a last ditch effort to use SAP

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a fully functional application that actually works in less than 24 hours and the result of that work is a product which we genuinely believe can help better the environment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is an incredible amount of potential in the applications we build at events like these that can help solve some of the most prevalent problems in this world
