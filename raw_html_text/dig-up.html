                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was inspired by the game "Doodle Jump" as this simple game hit top charts many times, the game "Dig Up!" was created similar to that game but with unique features
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In DigUp, The aim is to get at the top of the whole world, but you soon realize there is no ending in this world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Dig Up!" was built using a program called BuildBox which was one of the best platforms to create games as no programming and coding is needed which was very good for me as other apps that I have created took me months to create
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea nouniness of the app was a bit of a challenge as many apps similar to "Dig Up" are already in the app store but in the end, i have come to a good idea and hope that it reaches top charts! But one issue was the pricing of the program "BuildBox" it was good to make the game without coding but after all, im losing money and I might or might not get it back, but this doesn't let me down it's all about the experience of making the app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Second game I made and published on the app store after receiving much feedback on the fist one, this game also got me many feedbacks about it being fun and having good graphics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many ways to create applications and some don't need coding!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dig Up!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hoping to create other mods in the game and create more characters, also power-ups and enemies attacking is an idea for the future
