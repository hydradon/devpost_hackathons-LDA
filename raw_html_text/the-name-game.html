                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prior to arriving to Swamphacks V our school Florida international University had a hackathon meetup. During the meetup we were introduced to a team building game that was more fun than anything, we were left non stop laughing. So we decided to make an even funner version of the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Name Game accepts your team name where it tracks your score and compare it to other teams. Once you begin the game you take turns entering your team or people around you names, it returns a cool adjective followed by your name and you are awarded a point. The objective is to remember the names of all the new people around you but having fun and competing while you are at it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is built as a web application, using python for the backend along with flask for web api. sqlite for maintaining and tracking the scores of each of the teams, and for web design we used html, css, javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interfacing flask with the website was a challenges as it required some use of both sqlite and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting to finish the project as we intended it to be was an amazing reward and feeling. We each got to learn new languages, and explore new software. working with Flask was no easy task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned everything from how to work well as a team using github and git to track our work to learning how to implement sqlite onto python .
                </p>
