                    I was inspired by my own Etsy shop, kangaroocrafts.etsy.com. I found the process of scanning through hundreds of popular product listings to find keywords, and cross-checking them using the Etsy search engine and Google AdWords to be tedious, so I thought maybe an app can do this!

                    Ideally, this app pulls data from the Etsy API, specifically collecting keywords from trending categories and the associated trending tags. These "recommended keywords" are then stored in the application. The user inputs simple words that may describe their new listing. The app concatenates all logical two-word combinations of keywords and cross checks these simple words and concatenations with the "recommended keywords" list and returns a list of highly searched words that the seller should use in their own listing title and tags.

                    Currently the webapp is broken. I have a bare-bones user interface built using HTML

                    Challenges I ran into include that going into this, I only had basic python skills. I had to learn about APIs and web hosting, then I learned HTML. I am in the process of writing the working code using javascript, jquery and node.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of include the fact that I learned so many options for developing.

                    What's next for Etsy-Keyworder? I hope it actually works so I never have to do grueling SEO by hand again. I also plan to integrate it with Google AdWords to optimize listings in Google search. I know from experience that the trends on Google are definitely different than the trends on Etsy, so it is important to note the distinction. This app is currently specific to the Etsy community's trends, and the Etsy search engine.
