                        Yoga changed my life!
                    </strong>
                    I suffered from endless upper body injuries (carpal tunnel, tennis elbow, back pain) for years, and tried all kinds of mainstream and alternative routes to healing, until I returned to yoga and started a serious practice which completely solved my problems. Since then, I&rsquo;ve passionately shared yoga practices with everyone I meet who has similar issues &mdash; which is, almost everyone over the age of 18!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is
                    <strong>
                        my opportunity to share a simple but transformative core practice with potentially millions of people
                    </strong>
                    , many of whom live in non-coastal areas of the United States where yoga classes are not so easily found as in the Bay Area, where I live.

                            Voice is perfect for yoga, unlike visual apps. When you&rsquo;re practicing yoga in a real-life situation, you&rsquo;re mostly listening to the instructor&rsquo;s voice. It&rsquo;s more natural to use a voice skill than stare at a tiny phone or tablet while practicing yoga.
