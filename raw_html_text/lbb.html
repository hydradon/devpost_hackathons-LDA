                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dr. Sood takes care of patients with a variety of conditions in urgent care. The ones that stick out most in his mind are those that come in for STD checks. After he informs the patients that they are positive for an STD, the first reaction is often not shock at being diagnosed, but the sheer feeling of awkwardness and dread at having to notify multiple previous partners, many of whom they haven't spoken to in a long time. It was through Dr. Sood&rsquo;s research into other apps and identifying their many gaps, that he realized there was simply no elegant, free solution to take the awkwardness out of crucial step of notifying previous partners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main focus of this app is to provide an easy way for any patient who just found out they have been infected with an STD to quickly and anonymously notify a large number of their previous sexual partners. Not only that, but there is a function that will allow the patient to start logging at their last negative STD test, and notify all partners since that time frame. This functionality is contingent on receiving physician permission.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked with Amazon Simple Notification Service, and directed most of the workflow on AWS Management Console. We created an initial prototype of a web application via Ruby on Rails to demonstrate its proposed interaction with user.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to use AWS without any prior experience. In particular, understanding the workflow, functions, and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of learning how to use AWS and the associated workflow, functions, and javascript in order to create a working prototype/proof of concept for an application that aims to combat one of today&rsquo;s greatest epidemics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collectively the team learned how to design Android apps through Sketchware, how to formulate a proper pitch to VC or angel investors, and how to program using AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LBB
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next steps for LBB include modifying the prototype/proof of concept to include a push authenticator so that physicians can grant permission to individuals to send out the anonymous messages. Additionally we will address the topic of HIPAA compliance and further develop our marketing strategy for direct to consumer rollout.
