                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were aiming for an easy solution to avoid stress organizing teams. We felt that an easy tool to send links, share code and save text was perfect, so we built TeamHack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This tool helps you, and your team to manage your work, allowing you to have collaborative channels to share code, send text and organize your work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built TeamHack with node.js, using express as the web-server, and firebase as the database. We also used firepad to manage collaborative rooms and socket.io to make things easier for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some problems while trying to connect the backend and the frontend aswell as for managing more than two files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have developed an almost fully working tool which we think can be useful for fast and easy collaborating online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about backend services, such as Socket.io and Firebase. On the frontend we learned much about jQuery and some advanced html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TeamHack
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think our tool can become something very complete. Voice support or file importing could make it  a way more useful tool.
