                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Public service ads that really made a difference. Think, cigarettes, sport. Anything creative that made you kind of think about what's going on. We've tried the same thing but with a lot of data and public transport.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea is simple: a series of data-backed billboards around big cities. They can be installed over a road, on the pain square, doesn't really matters but what matters is to drive people to the point where they understand that using a private vehicle is more cumbersome, ecologically hazardous and time-consuming.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made use of data sources from Findland's awesome data sources that made it possible to update the billboards almost instantly. We emulate physical billboards with a webapp that is essentially a slider with a couple of data backed promo billboards. And we wanted to work with realtime data about gase pollutions gathered via gasometers before billboard, but on the this stage we just mocked it using real average gas emission for one car appoved by Euro standards.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part was using the sources that weren't exactly developer's friendly. But big kudos to the brave developers from a couple years back who did the impossible and built an API around one of the most peculiar ones. Other challenge that we ran into is the technology stack that is Haskell as backend language. It was hard.
