                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team mates really liked the augmented reality and map features of the popular app Pokemon Go, so we decided to make a game that utilizes these features while focusing more on combat mechanics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our game uses the phone camera and gyroscope to make enemies appear in a random location. Players look around with their phone cameras to spot the enemy and swipe to swing a sword if they chose a melee character or tap to create fireballs if they chose a ranged character.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to develop the app. We programmed in C# using the Vuforia SDK for the AR camera. We wrote functions that randomly generate enemies within a radius.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of trouble with version control because we were having trouble syncing up our files on github. It was our first experience making an android app, so we spent a lot of time trying to find all the right tools to build and run our unity project onto the android phone. We unfortunately could not get the latitude and longitude of the user which prevented us from adding some of the features we wanted to add.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make a mobile game app that has working combat features and effectively uses the camera and gyroscope.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned a great deal about android app development, unity game development, and the Vuforia API.
