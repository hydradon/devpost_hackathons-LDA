                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As technology grows more complex, the ways users are given to interact with the internet and software has grown more elaborate as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal was to provide a minimalistic interface for browsing through social data while also maintaining a sense of depth. Social interactions form a rich and vast portion of the internet, and we wanted this experience to reflect the connectedness and span of human communication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SocialSphere provides users the ability to experience social content from Twitter in a new and relaxing way. By using VR, you can look in a full 360 degrees to view Tweets, which refresh their content as soon as you look too far away from them. In this way, the sphere is a constantly refreshing source of Tweets that allow you to get to new information by simply moving your head back and forth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All you need to do to is look around. Tweets expand when viewed, and you can navigate to a new search term by looking at relevant hashtags and words. The experience is completely hands-free, and hopes to make users feel fully immersed.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built in Unity with C#, with use of Twitter REST API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially had difficulty pulling tweets from the Twitter API. Additionally, we had to try 5 different machines before we were able to successfully pair the Oculus.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an experience that numerous other hackers described as 'relaxing'
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How easy it is to fall down a rabbit hole of connected social information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SocialSphere
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitter is far from the only social site that can be displayed in a SocialSphere. Tumblr, Facebook, Reddit; this is only the beginning of how VR can be used to visualize and interact with social surroundings
