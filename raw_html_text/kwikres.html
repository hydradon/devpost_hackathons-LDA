                <p>
                    KwikRes solves the problem of long lines for food at corporate and large events.  KwikRes allows the hosts to preselect caterers and the user to select and pay for the food they want to buy.  Then when the time comes for lunch etc. the user is notifed by the app to approach the right table.  This prevents long lines by creating stations/food-category specific tables so the whole process is streamlined.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python as our main language
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to build in python and we had no previous knowledge of python.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We pretty much taught ourselves an abridged version of python in a matter of 24 hours
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the 24 hours given for the hackathon, we learned how to work with classes, polymorphism, inheritance, and how to create CLI app in python
                </p>

                    While the idea for food is useful, this concept can be appleid to a myriad of other projects.  For example, the same concept of streamlining food can be used to streamline the organ donation process by creating a national (or global) database and matching those who need a certain organ with those that are available.
