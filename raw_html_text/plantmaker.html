                    ,,,, seriously,,,, you ever wanna populate your garden with some flowers of a family but not know exactly what genus? Yeah,,,, yeaaaaah,,, and with a 3D view it's just more real and gives you that experience of visualisation.

                    All built in glorious, agile, flaw-free, vegan, non-gmo javascript. Incredibly efficient. This has probably been one of the full things I've made with js (and granted... it only really does need a client side so its valid, okay?), and after this, I want nothing more to write in any other language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I originally wanted to download the dataset and go from that data, but the bandwidth sucked and I'm not about to expend an inordinate amount of data on data that might be hit or miss, etc, etc. So the actual data I've forgone for now, and I made faux data for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used three js (a wrapper for webGL) to build the scene and. you know. draw the stuff. I forgot how to do recursion properly, so that's why all of the plants are actually more vine looking. I'm not going to lie, I also derped on math midway through and you know. 3d's weird if you haven't had practice programming it). I also made a fatal mistake and conglomerated my math and drawing into one function and totally. like oh man the global variables. why are there even functions, why did i write it like this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had trouble thinking this through logically, but it's logical enough to work. namely the. it's hard to know how to write generative functions based on data you dont have. and i kinda just didn't know what should map to what, and I didn't really plan my functions thoroughly enough from the start so. i had to do a lot of backtracking later (but i was too hesitant in the first place ("joy" emoji) ("joy" emoji) ("joy" emoji) ("joy" emoji) to even write anything so like you know breakeven).
