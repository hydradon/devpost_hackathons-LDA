                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the importance of creating an app that allows people to quickly make decisions to provide first aid in emergency situations. Although many people are CPR and/or first aid certified, it becomes difficult to act in high-pressure situations, so this app is designed to assist with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app asks the user a series of yes  or no questions to guide him or her toward the proper action in a sitatuation requiring first aid. There is an option for people who have no idea about what they need to do, and other easy-access options if people are able to identify the problem automatically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by writing the HTML and CSS code from scratch to produce the minimalistic user interface that we wanted for the app. As a team, we split up the work to efficiently complete this task.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally tried to use Android Studio to produce an android app, but discovered that it was difficult to use after struggling with it for several hours. In the end, we decided to first produce a functional web version of our app, which could later be converted to a mobile app.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although this was my team's first hackathon, we were proud that we were able to create a complete, functional webpage. We learned new things about javascript and app development, and gained a lot from this experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that it is important to be open to new ideas and help from mentors. I was able to learn a lot from other hackers and mentors, as well as the actual development process.
                </p>

                    We all enjoyed this hackathon, so we look forward to attending other programming competitions and hackathons in the future.
