                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses HTML5 webRTC to take a snapshot of the user for security, firebase for cloud hosting and Realtime Cloud Messaging to push mobile and webapp notifications to users on visiting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built a website with HTML and routed user info through firebase CLI and Realtime Cloud Messaging API for messages over their network. Later implemention was going to include nexmo text messaging but we ran out of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting firebase to RCM, running node.js with non-node applications.Connecting firebase hosting and heroku together.
Arduinos ran out quickly so we couldn't try a sensor for checkin.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the Push notifications to work and send, and setting up the framework for later server implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tons of javascript, Firebase CLI
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for hackgsucheckin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Server implementation, texmo integration to text users.
Perhaps Arduino sensor implementation so the webpage opens as the user steps in.
