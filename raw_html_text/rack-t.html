                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For shoppers like me, sometimes I have a very specific item or style in mind that I&rsquo;m looking for and I would like to get it as quickly as possible without having to walk though the entire mall. One of my biggest struggles shopping in person is that I can&rsquo;t compare items from different shops or mix and match items to create the perfect outfit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
