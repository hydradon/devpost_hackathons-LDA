                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a very visual learning and I had a hard time with calculus three because it required visualizing 3D graphs. So I thought it would be a great idea to used VR to graph.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses VR to display graphs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used unity, blender and online 3D models of graphs to build the VR.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the internet to extract 3D models because there are not many 3D models out there!
                </p>

                    Successfully doing VR for the first time!!

                    Incorporating this into different subjects! For example, biology students can use it to see and walk around a human body and chemistry students can use it to visually see the bonds and chemical reactions.
