                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    our original ideas fizzled because of technological complications so we decided to build off of a face detection algorithm to make a photo booth

                    What it does

                <p>
                    it zooms in onto your face, predicts your emotions, and takes pictures of each of your emotions as a sort of collage

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we downloaded faceapi.js examples and modified it

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    the leap motion binaries we originally we going to use were incredibly hard to get working; they were written in python 2, stopped supporting macOS and Linux like 6 years ago, and the latest version dropped support for all languages except C which we didn't know. Then we tried to use google cloud's vision API and we were also not able to get it working even when following the directions (intelliJ plugin wasn't working for us I believe?) so we pretty much just

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we at least made something that works and fun
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we learned that we shouldn't try to use things that we don't know how to use, and it's hard to do a hackathon without familiarity of the software beforehand. Also, solving problems doesn't mean that you're making progress--for example, we found a github script that ported the python 2 code to python 3, but it didn't fix our overall problem of getting the Leap Motion sdk to work.

                    What's next for Face Zoom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I guess make its gui prettier and add more features such as automatically saving photos, outputting them in a nice way, sharing with social media, filters, etc.
