                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this project because we were into the idea of using HTML and a basic web app to design a great module to use flashcards on the blackboard homepage. Seeing how widely used Quizlet is, we decided to make a version of our own for users that are on Blackboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The flashcards are a simple tool that is very easy to use. You have the ability to search for a pack of flashcards and also the option to create a pack of flashcards. These packs have no limit on how many you can create! If you need to find a pack for your class, you are able to search the course name.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using ASP.net framework. With this, we connected each of the packs and the flashcards to a SQL database. We used a base of HTML and CSS to create the base for the pages. We then hosted this website on Azure and did an iframe HTML tag to display it as a module in Blackboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into issues with time and connecting the projects between the group. We started having troubles with GitHub so we ended up sending files after each step. It slowed us down in the process so we ended up being short on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how we utilized the Blackboard module and made a simple web application that was easy to use. We are also proud of how well the application runs and how it looks on the blackboard homepage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many new things with HTML and CSS along with a few new things about SQL and ASP.net. The ASP.net framework was new to some of us so it was neat to learn how it worked and how well it worked with plain HTML code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Blackboard Flashcards
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to improve Blackboard Flashcards and make it better looking and cleaner. Since time was short, we were not able to finish all of the visual changes that we wanted to make. We decided that we would continue to work on it if it did well in the hackGVSU because we enjoyed the process of making it. We are hoping that Blackboard Flashcards is able to continue to run well and make it nicer in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Note
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The find feature is still in the works. Also, input validation is not a thing so do not put apostrophes in the text boxes.
