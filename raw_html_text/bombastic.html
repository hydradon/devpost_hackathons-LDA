                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took ideas from two game. "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes" gave use the bomb defusing aspect, and Spaceteam, which gave us the idea for one person having the instructions to someone else's bomb.

                    , you will be assigned to an agent name and a waiting room.When one person starts the game, everyone in the waiting room is put into the game. Everyone is then given a panel of randomly assigned of circuits and buttons, and is given an instruction. The instruction does not match your panel of controls though, so you must rely on other people to relay information on how to defuse your bomb. If one person messes up, everyone loses the game.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used web sockets, javascript, and HTML primarily.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a web server to communicate with the clients using web sockets, and a bug that caused the game to end when someone receives two commands, and performed one of them.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully set up the game so that anyone, on any platform, could join a game. We also surprised ourselves with the amount of functionality we included, such as having four modules that were completely randomized and random, specific instructions.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Server/client communication is not always straightforward, nor is it easy.

                    We plan on adding more modules, more functionality of the, scaling difficulty, a larger control panel for users, and a
