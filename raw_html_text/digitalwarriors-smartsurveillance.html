                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Off late there have been many incidents on the national highways/ secluded patches country wide involving petty theft, malpractices to big crime plots, terrorist activities, robbery and rapes.
These areas, though part of important areas, lack police Surveillance and monitoring.
Pinning CCTV's on these areas would not bring any emergency help but decoding on what happened the morning after.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drones fitted with high definition cameras can span a large area and can be controlled and moved anywhere. 
These drones can be fitted with sound sensors/ devices which would use predix analytics to smartly analyze if there is something out of the normal happening in that area, say it can sense and decode the alarm from someone's phone or can read some sharp noises, explosion, fire or anything and report back to the nearest 
police stations of the area.
This would not only call in for emergency services but would be very beneficial in averting the mishaps.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Created microservices in predix that would interact with the hardware system to collect below data points
   a) Sound
   b) Images
   c)Electromagnetic Radiations/
   d) Location(Longitude/Latitude)
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Created microservices that utilizes above data points to fine tune it for further analysis
3) Created a core analysis microservice that take the fine tuned data to detect anomalies(Fire,explosion.mob    gathering) with higher probabilities
4) UI that shows the near real time monitoring using the above micro services
5) Instant notification in case of anomaly detection
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Hardware Interaction
2) Took us some time to be comfortable with predix services
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Building a small,smart  model of the public safety system that in future can digitize the entire security system
2) Created 8 micoservices in Predix
3) Created a robust database in predix using postgresSQL
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) We got a good exposure to lot of technologies :Python,Java,Restful webservices with jersey,Jackson API,PostgreSQL,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DigitalWarriors-SmartSurveillance
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Making a more robust Analysis service to detect anomaly for real time surveillance
2) To go into actual hardware interaction
3) Bring the idea to real world implementation.
