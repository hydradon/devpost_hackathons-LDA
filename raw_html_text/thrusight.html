                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Distracted driving causes 10% of all fatal driving accidents and 17% of all car accidents that cause injuries.  We wanted to reduce these accidents that can easily be avoided if information is presented to the driver in a way that doesn't take their attention away from the road.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows the driver to see information like speed and RPM without having to glance down from their view of the road.  It uses a screen to reflect information up to the windshield to create a holographic effect that allows the driver to see the information while still being able to see the road.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ThruSight connects to the OBD-II(On-Board Diagnostic) port of your car with a bluetooth ELM327 adapter.  This bluetooth adapter is then sent to a laptop which sends OBD-II PIDs (On-board diagnostics Parameter IDs) to the adapter, which will report back the information from the sensors in the car.  This allows us to get information straight from the car and not from exterior sources.  The laptop then puts the information on a web server which allows an android tablet to process and display it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging to figure out how to communicate properly with the ELM327 adapter to get the information that we wanted.  We had to figure out how to properly send the PIDs and how to parse the data that is sent back from the vehicle.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to gather data from cars through the OBD-II port, which is available on all cars sold after 1/1/96.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ThruSight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporate simple notifications for things like messages and weather alerts.  Also allow multiple screens with user customization.
