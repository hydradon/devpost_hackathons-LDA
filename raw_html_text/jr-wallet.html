                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love the way technology and education have combined to revolutionize learning and I am eager to help children learn new skills anywhere and anyway they'd like!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jr. Wallet teaches children 8-12 smart financial decision making through an interactive game that models real life situations. Players are encouraged to leverage time, money and satisfaction to find the most optimal decision in each situation.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Xcode and Swift.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I learnt Swift and XCode starting Saturday and it has  been an amazing experience that has only motivated me to continue building on Jr. Wallet and creating new apps.
