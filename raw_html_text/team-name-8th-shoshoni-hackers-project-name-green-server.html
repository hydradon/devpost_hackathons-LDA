                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team's biggest inspirations was how the Green company is using their invention for the better of others, and not just for themselves. That is really inspiring, and shows that they are out to do good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows the storyboard for a game that we would like to develop in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We brainstormed our ideas onto a whiteboard. Then we improved our ideas based on mentor feedback. Then we created a visual storyboard on keynote.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A challenge we ran into setting up the storyboard. We did not know how to, but once we got started we figured it out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole team is super proud of the brainstorming that we jotted down on the whiteboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the green box, and the good impacts it has on others. We also learned about how it uses blockchain, and how it is the first company to use the proof of power protocol.
                </p>

                    We are going to develop this story board into a game.
