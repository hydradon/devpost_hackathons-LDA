                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is 5 phase of a customer journey in modern marketing. These are aware, appeal, ask, act and advocate. Advocacy is well-known as the highest achievements for all marketers, because this phase triggers a domino effect that boosts people awareness of a product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This concept also applies to the tourism industry. This idea is inspired based on Starbucks' success on the tweetacoffee campaign and Herschel supply's #WellTravelled campaign that both use social media as advocation based marketing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Overview
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our survey shows that people awareness of tourism in Banyuwangi still needs big improvements. There are several things worth mentioning in the condition of Banyuwangi's tourism now:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Banyuwangi has a lot of hidden tourism gems. Beaches, culinaries, geological parks, and the local cultures are too beautiful for the tourist to miss.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Banyuwangi is located near Bali and is the only city that has a port that takes tourist from Java to Bali.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Every year, the number of both domestic and international tourists in Indonesia is increasing rapidly.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Despite all things mentioned above, tourist awareness on Banyuwangi's tourism potential is very low. Banyuwangi is still seen only as a gateway to Bali more than a tourism spot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that is why we propose an app that increasing tourist advocation to boost people awareness of tourism in Banyuwangi.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Samudra is an app that has a goal to trigger tourists so they will use their social media to share their trip experience, so this will increase awareness of tourism in Banyuwangi for their friends or families. Whenever users share their experience using social media on the appointed location or ongoing event, they will be rewarded using a voucher. This voucher will work as a gift and will become a reason for someone to visit the place of the voucher issuer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To implement this idea, there will be a mobile app that is connected to social media so whenever users are done with their objective, rewards will be sent automatically.
