                    The inspiration for
                    <strong>
                        LVLS
                    </strong>
                    stems from a casual conversation with an affiliated member of the HARMAN company that demonstrated a fundamental absence in visual equalizer functionality.  Upon learning there was no such function currently available, it was our sworn duty as avid music listeners and connoisseurs of the ideal audio-visual entertainment experience to provide such functionality to our fellow, music-listening brethren.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application allows the Pulse 2 to execute proper audio visualization by utilizing the 11x9 LED screen to provide a visual equalizer.

                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized both Android Studio and JBL Pulse 2 SDK.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of challenges with mapping out the layout of the LED lights in the system.  We had to physically draw out a layout and visualize the placement of each LED light that needed to light up. There were issues with adding activities to handle to operations.  Lastly, brainstorming a way to properly implement a FFT* was difficult. While, we worked tirelessly, we unfortunately could not complete in time to meet deadline.
