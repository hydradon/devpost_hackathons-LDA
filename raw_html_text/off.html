                    The Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    There is a growing trend in millennial culture. This is a trend towards spending time on devices rather than with people. According to research from Elon University, if someone is on their phone during a conversation, this will diminish the quality of conversation. Not exactly ground-breaking is it. No, but the most worrying part of the study is that 62% of individuals on Elon&rsquo;s campus continue to use technology despite their self-awareness of this blatant issue. Our app is an incentive-based solution intended to combat this issue.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Our app uses points to offer rewards. One earns point by: for every minute the phone is locked, the user will gain 1 point; for every minute the phone is unlocked, the user will lose 1 point; for every minute the phone is using social media apps, the user will lose 2 points. These points can be earned and subsequently redeemed for discounts and rewards with local and online vendors.
                </p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also a charity incentive. For every point earned, we will donate a cent to a worthy charity.

                    We built this an android app on Android Studio. We designed the app pages on Adobe Illustrator before building the pages and functionalities.

                <p>
                    One of the challenges we faced was glitches and bugs within Android Studio. For example, it wouldn't accept images at random (it wasn't based on size, type, name, or anything else we could think of). Another challenge we faced is getting the app to run in the background.
