                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spend too much time deciding where to eat especially when everyone is like "it doesn't matter, you choose". So the group ends up standing around for hours before someone decides for everyone. We wanted to make an app that can help save some time. The app will decide for you what restaurant to eat at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a list of restaurants on Franklin and generates a restaurant depending on the cuisine, price range or dine-in (or don't care) option you choose.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all came in with no app development experience so none of us knew how to use Android Studio. It was a challenge to learn how Android Studio worked and how to put the java code into the Android java code. ***

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually created an app that works, buttons that respond.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio and how tedious app development is.

                    What's next for Chews!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to expand the list of restaurants one day, maybe adding more information about each restaurant at the end including links to the restaurant's own homepage. We also hope to be able to incorporate more pictures into the app so people would know what kind of food to expect at that restaurant.
