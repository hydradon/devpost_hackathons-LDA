                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before we can receive our end-of-semester grades, we are asked to complete not-so-brief surveys about our course instructors. Of course, those surveys were necessities because we so badly wanted to see our grades, but we also found them tedious... It doesn't have to be like this for all surveys. What if we created a fun app that rewarded users for taking surveys and made them keep coming back? That was the vision for AnthemConnection; employees and managers can earn achievements, maintain streaks, and take surveys on a fun, bright interface inspired by the DuoLingo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, it is an app for employees and managers to take company surveys. A unique component is a streak, meaning the number of continuous days that a user takes at least one survey. Another feature is an achievements panel and leaderboard so users may get rewarded for their submissions. Finally, there is a feedback system that tracks the number of responses and frequency of each response per survey question. The data from employee surveys is stored in the firebase database anonymously, and managers can access it for their own purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off by designing the UI of the app. Then, we worked on back-end development and graphic design. Next, we worked on the firebase database, and random data was generated and analyzed for the database. Finally, we made the app come to life in Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into UI challenges- getting the interface to work out the way we wanted. Storing the values in the database was also a major challenge that set us back 4 hours. Finally, most of the team had little to no experience with Android Studio, so implementing our ideas was tricky at times.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was 3 of our team members' first times competing in hackathon, and we were very productive for the most part!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio leaves much to be desired.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AnthemConnection
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though we are confident in our app, there is still much more room for improvement. Our main challenge was initializing the database and feedback systems. Without these features, the survey app really has no meaning. We would like to improve the feedback system in terms of delivery and back-end development.
