                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming from parents who have immigrated to the US, we all struggled with them helping us with homework. Not because they were not smart, but because there was a language barrier from Spanish to English.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project translates English speech to multiple languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Our Vision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Kids can have their parents help them with homework by reading the problem aloud and Alexa will then translate. The parent(s)/guardian(s) can then help them with the problem at hand and not let language barriers hold them back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Rapid API (Google Translate) to build a skill for Amazon's Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of integrating the Rapid API with Alexa. We would love to see Amazon improve their API integration support.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As rookie hackers, we are proud for coming here and trying our very best. This is a project that is near to our hearts and look forward to utilizing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time using Alexa and APIs.
                </p>

                    What's next for Alexa's Titan Translator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to improve the translator by finding a different translator and Alexa's accent by integrating Polly.
