                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole story began when I decided to use Xero as an accounting software for my business. I'm using mainly Stripe, PayPal to accept payments on my website. As it was really difficult to export manually those transactions into  Xero, I started looking for solutions. There are several on the market; however, they are poorly designed. One of them didn't have support at all and keeps charging my credit card. Others don't have the flexibility I was hoping for. So I came up with the idea of TransFeeds.com that would connect digital payment solutions with Xero hassle-free.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Basically, it exports all the Stripe transactions including refunds and bitcoin payments into Xero. Other similar software imports only the following Stripe transactions types: charge, transfers, and fees
Furthermore, with TransFeeds you can choose different export methods. For example, you can export Stripe transactions as regular Bank Feeds, as reconciled Bank Feeds, as Bills and Invoices, and as Bank Transactions.
Also, complex rules can be added, so that the system can handle various scenarios such as multi-currency accounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The following technologies were used to build the software PHP, MYSQL, Amazon EC2, Javascript, Jquery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part was creating the rules system so the user could tweak how exactly the transactions are synchronized into Xero, thus, to handle various scenarios.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest accomplishment is that you can fine-tune the software based on rules. For example, you can create a rule that would export transfers with AUD currency as regular bank feeds, and payments with USD currency as bank transactions(Via API). Furthermore, you can change how different fields will be shown in Xero such as Payee, Transaction Description.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to use Xero Api so I could create more plugins for Xero.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TransFeeds
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connect with other Payment Processors such as Braintree, PayPal. Developing restful API. Ability to link the customer and all its payments from Stripe with the customer for the e-commerce website, so that Transfeeds could create invoices automatically for that specific customer in Xero.
