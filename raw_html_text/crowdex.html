                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friends are always asking about the most reliable set of coins and THEN! we argue about it. 
Now I can take a stake and profit from my wisdom or suffer from my folly through Crowdex - a social, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency indexing and prediction marketplace.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Crowdex is a social cryptocurrency-index platform that allows users to:
(1) create cryptocurrency indices and to stake their confidence in the form of Ether
(2) Share their reasoning and research 
(3) Set a "performance call-date" 
(4) Allow others to take a counter position on the performance of such index
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Blockstack Authentication and Gaia storage to store user profile information such as followers, indices and performance
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use  ChainPoint for proof-of-existence of "research documents" such as written articles, reports or URL. In essence allowing other users to challenge their indices or inquiry on how they came up with such index.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We run on Ethereum. 
We developed our betting smart contract using Solidity.
We use Truffle, Web3 for developing the front-end app, and Ganache for deploying test network.
