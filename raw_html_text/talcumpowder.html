                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facebook messenger bots are the new coolest thing on the block and we wanted to use them to help others and make a difference in peoples lives. We personally know those who require consumption of medication and have first hand experience having absentmindedly forgotten to take nutrient supplements or prescription medication. With how often people use social media communications, especially Facebook messenger who is trying to integrate itself into a key part of having a mobile phone, we can relay communications between a medical professional and an individual prescribed to a medication easily and conveniently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spams people to improve their health by providing routine and personal reminders to take care of their physical well-being. A medical professional can set up a routine schedule for a patient so that they can be reminded frequently and be able to review the process and cautions on taking medicine and nutrients. In addition, the bot allows inquiries to be logged for the medical professionals to check up on how their patients are doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Facebook's developer dashboard, we hooked up a backend using flask to take requests and sends them to the user. To use Facebook's bot interface, we had to create a webhook by setting up a server using ngrok and then hooking it up to the interface to send and receive request.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time creating a Facebook messenger bot, or any bot at all so the learning step was a big hurdle.

                <p>
                    We were able to use python multi-threading to provide timed reports and respond to user messages simultaneously.
