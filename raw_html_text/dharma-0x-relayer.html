                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    Let's you create a loan on Dharma and then sell it on 0x.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used create-react-app and the dharma and 0x tutorials to create a loan request, fill it, create a 0x order for the underlying debt erc721 token and fill that too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using two different test environments and starterkits (Dharma and 0x) at the same time was pretty challenging. Porting it to work on Kovan was also hard without much prior knowledge in web3js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel this is a new and novel idea which can be the basis for a secondary market for loans down the line!
We learnt tons about dharma and 0x.
                </p>

                        Decide upon idea much earlier...

                    <li>
                        Using web3js, dharma orders and loans, 0x orders etc
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Definitely more complex to build dapps than you would think!
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    What's next for Dharma 0x relayer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make the sell order signing work so that the poc runs cleanly.
Create a relayer backend with an api and actually make the thing work with existing loans etc.
