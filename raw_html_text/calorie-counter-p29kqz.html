                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I always find it frustrating that I have to open my phone to add an item into a calorie app, so using Alexa, we can easily track calories just by saying what you ate and the most popular option will be entered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assuming a daily 2000 calories, you can tell alexa what you ate and she will say how many calories you have left for the day.
                </p>
