                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Our team came up with the idea of making a transit app because many people used bicycles at UCSB. People forgot where their bikes parked sometimes. Also, many UCSB students who live outside of campus often ride buses as their transportations. Therefore, we decided to create an app related to transportation.
