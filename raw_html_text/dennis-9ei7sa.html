                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used design thinking to iterate on the idea with the partner company Planmeca. We built UI mocks in Sketch and made a mobile web application with React. We also acknowledge the possibilities of tracking patients in and out of the clinic predicting care adherence and clinic patient flow, for example.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to collect medical data for statistical purposes or for building better machine learning based tools is a major hurdle. Being creative about on how to bring value to the patients and care takers from the very start is therefore essential.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are especially proud of the design of the app and the possibilities on how we can engage patients in personal care.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about the technical challenges that dentists currently face in treating patients and the game changing possibilities that tracking offers for patients and healthcare professionals.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have more health recording devices connect to the Planmeca Personal platform extends the capabilities for both the patients and dentists to manage oral health. To maximise the participation of dental clinics on the platform, it is key to outline the benefits that in-clinic patient tracking brings.
