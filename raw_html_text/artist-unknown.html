                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to promote artistic expression in new mediums, being able to easily create sculptures digitally with your own hands was an excellent opportunity for this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can use your hands (provided you own a LeapMotion sensor), to sculpt, carving away at a digital marble block.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built in Unity, a popular game development engine that LeapMotion supports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We spent the first several hours just planning out the design of the application before we jumped into development, the development itself progressed relatively smoothly; compared to previous hackathon experience, the aide of a solid plan was extremely useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We broke the marble structure we sculpt into a series of smaller 'voxels', and selectively remove them on contact. We also added the ability to clap to reset the state of the sculpture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally this was going to additionally be a virtual reality application. Due to some hardware constraints, we had to scale down to a 2-dimensional representation of our idea. Learning to use the LeapMotion API with unity took a lot of our time in this competition as well, and was the leading challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to pull off an application like this after hacking together the LeapMotion and Unity APIs in such a short time is definitely a feeling of accomplishment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A good plan at the start can save hours of work cleaning up later. And sleep is a useful thing to have.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Artist Unknown
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Should we acquire LeapMotion devices in the future, we would add different initial shapes and the option to add colors, eventually working towards VR support in the more distant future.
