                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always keep on losing remotes and cannot find the right one at the right time. We thought to eliminate this problem completely by creating a universal smart remote that can control all devices
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It identifies the device it is being pointed at changes the controls on the display accordingly. It adapts to user's preferences and style.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scraped the internet for thousands of images of devices and annotated these devices. Then we trained the neural net on an AWS server to get our weight files. Created a flask server that handles the requests and processing. A raspberry pi (client) is our remote with the camera module that communicates with the flask server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emitting IR signals using a raspberry pi. It was very difficult to emit the IR rays at the desired frequency and time duration to control a device.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We scraped the web, annotated the images and trained a neural net in a short span of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Darkflow. Additionally, we spent a lot of time working on the hardware that gave us a good insight into how a remote is supposed to be designed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for OneCtrl
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to train it more on a wider range of devices with a larger set of images to make our net robust and accurate.
