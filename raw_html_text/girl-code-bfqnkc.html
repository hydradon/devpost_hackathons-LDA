                    WHO WE ARE
Our names are Manaal Siddiqui and Annabel Gomez. We are high school seniors who're passionate about supporting other girls in STEM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHY IT&rsquo;S IMPORTANT
This social media network will inspire girls who are interested in STEM and build and strong community for these women to support each other and reach their full potential.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted a place where women and girls could are exposed and notified of the opportunities all around them. A hub full of information, networking, and collaboration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a social media network for girls and women in STEM. It makes it super easy for girls to keep up with fellow peers in STEM, make connections, find employment opportunities, be up-to-date with upcoming events, submit project proposals, collaborate on projects, help each other solve everyday problems, and personalize an event feed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the platform cloud9 to edit our code, and coded in HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to get it started, because we were somewhat new to HTML . We had to create several pages that were interactive, which required huge amounts of busy work. It was a lot to do in not not much time, and it proved a challenge to manage our time efficiently and strive on. Furthermore, we originally had a team of three, but it dwindled to two after one of our teammates left. The last few hours were some of the most stressful, because we had only two people now instead of three.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to learn HTML and new HTML techniques to develop and code a working and customized website from the ground up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to enhance our HTML skills. We also learned how to effectively work together to collaborate on the same code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to eventually launch  as an official social media platform that will open new and exciting opportunities for women and girls. This will further inspire girls to pursue STEM careers and provide support.
