                    Frustrated with current parking procedures, we decided parking lots could be smarter. So we originally wanted to make an app and/or webapp to color where cars are and aren't to help a driver find a spot. However, as we were working, we realized that humans can see a picture just fine and that this technology would work much better for autonomous vehicles that cannot easily recognize objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, we used OpenCV to write a python script that takes an image of a parking lot and tells which spots are empty and which are not. This gives valuable information to all parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The autonomous vehicle gets:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Current data on the closest parking spot (which means it will not be driving around until it finds one)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To the spot quicker (saving fuel [whether electric, gas, etc.])
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The business owner gets:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Data regarding how full a lot section is
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Customers spending less time in the lot and more time in the store
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The best part:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It can potentially use existing CCTV/security cameras already installed in the lot for the data feed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cost is very little considering this can run on a RaspberryPi0
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The future:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Once autonomous vehicles are more popular, this will encourage parking lots to be smarter. This means a car may be able to get data from multiple lots and pick the best one to park in based on spot availability and factor in parking lot prices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Less movement in a parking lot means less chances for accidents (Hack-cidents?)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Humans getting where they need to be quicker
                    </li>
