                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing a new social network wouldn't be very impactful. The top 10 athletes on twitter have a total of about 150,000,000 followers. It would be near impossible to create a new app that can compete with that. I decided that it would be best to create an app built off of twitter because it is already the best athlete-to-fan communication platform. TweetSmart only has to target the athletes, a much smaller user base than targeting millions of people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app's core features are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An improved feed: Sentiment analysis makes it so athletes don't have to deal with negative tweets. Athletes used to have to only deal with a couple bad newspaper articles occasionally. Now they have to deal with a ton of tweets. TweetSmart hopes to solve this problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Event notifications: Athletes are reminded shortly after sports events in their calendars to tweet about the event. Athletes don't want to have to set aside time to send out tweets. With TweetSmart, they are reminded to tweet after every sports related event on their calendar.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ranking: Athletes are competitive, ranking them based off of user interaction helps them to interact more frequently
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Configurability: Users can configure almost everything about this app.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Feed-
Built off of Fabric's timeline. It loads in recent tweets to the user. Sentiment analysis for the feed can be controlled from settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Event notifications -
Load in all of the user's events that a related to sports into a local database. Notifications are scheduled to remind athletes to tweet about each sport event shortly after they happen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a lot of difficulty getting events to work. Eventually, I figured out that rather than loading an array into the table, it would be better to persist the events to the database and use Parse's provided tableview.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to design parts of the UI in Illustrator. It was fun, but it took forever.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to learn how to use Adobe Illustrator. I'm also proud of the fact that I was able to design a semi-complete ios app. I made my first ios app in October at a hackathon. This is my first app that I would actually be proud to show someone.

                    I learned how to use:

                <ul>

                        Scheduled local notifications

                <h2>
                    What's next for Twitter Dashboard for Athletes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are some UI changes that I need to make. I would like to improve the look of each tableView. I also want to integrate sentiment analysis more deeply into the app. Athletes should be able to know before they tweet if the text is negative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notes
-In the demo, the feed showed up blank. That only happened because no-one has tweeted at me recently.
-I encourage you to check out the google docs link at the bottom of this submission. It describes the idea very thoroughly.
