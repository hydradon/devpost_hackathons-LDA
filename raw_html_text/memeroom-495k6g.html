                    Obstacles Faced
                </h1>
                <p>
                    We intended to explore a lot of options for this chatroom before stumbling upon Chatkit, such as socket programming, Firebase, and other chatroom available technologies.
Other than a brief power outage in Isla Vista, the Chatkit tutorial followed was not up to date and was not too straightforward, as this is a new language for us.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Learning Experience
                </h1>
                <p>
                    For the both of us, we grasped the bare basics of starting a React application. We also learned how to write a REST API with Flask, and how to make calls to it.
                </p>

                    Future Endeavours
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This is a work-in-progress. While some components have come alive, such as the image search and text addition to it and using the Chatkit API in localhost, we were optimistic in the features we wanted to include.
