                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) defines health literacy as "the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions." About 40 percent of American adults have "basic" and "below basic" health literacy. It differs by several factors, but varies dramatically by age.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MedSimplifAI allows patients to upload a picture of their medical prescription and provides them with definitions of medical terms they may have trouble understanding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Text Detection with Google Cloud's Vision API to read the text from an image of a medical prescription and created a Python dictionary using Harvard's Medical Dictionary of Health Terms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use Google Cloud Storage, Vision API, Shell and other tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MedSimplifAI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to find ways to further facilitate managing health-related related task, for example, interpreting the directions to take prescribed medications or creating a tool for patients to easily find answers to medical questions they have.
