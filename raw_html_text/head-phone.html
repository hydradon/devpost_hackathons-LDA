                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A GoPro is expensive and out of reach for someone who simply wants first person or hands free video. Everyone has a camera in a form of a smartphone, so why not 3D print a way to mount it on your head? It's inexpensive and effective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It sits on your head and your phone gets strapped in. Start recording and enjoy the amazing first person/hands free footage!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I first outlined the model in a program called OnShape, keeping in mind the measurements and limitations of a 3D printer. The first model was uncomfortable and had the wrong view angle, so I printed another one with better ergonomics and shooting angles. The headband is made of 4 looped insulated wires attached to Velcro and secured with heat shrink tubing. Finally, a rubber band secures the phone using specially designed grooves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trigger is made out of a disassembled selfie stick with tubing as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sourcing parts for sure. I spent a full hour looking for one rubber band. The Velcro? Ripped from my and my partner's laptop chargers. The wire that constitutes the headband is insulated copper wire, meant to be used electrically and definitely not as a type of rope.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a second and comfier design is definitely there. I'm most proud of being resourceful and creative to build my model, however.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Copper wire is very strong. Heat shrink tubing is a lifesaver. Not everyone's forehead caves in like the Mariana Trench. No one in a hackathon has a rubber band.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Head-Phone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Releasing it open source on Thingiverse for everyone to download. A better head strap. An updated design to better accomdate other phones. Setting up an Etsy or Shapeways shop. Perhaps a better name.
