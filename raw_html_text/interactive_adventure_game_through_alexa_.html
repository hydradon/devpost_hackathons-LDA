                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw the tool on the GitHub samples
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A voice based interactive adventure game. You can input commands for decisions through Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an API from Github, and the Alexa skills developer kit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the API work (it was not intended for windows 10). Making the save and upload function work (it had very specific rules for working). Uploading it as an Alexa skill, it was a bit confusing at first. We also couldn't create the graphical interface in time. We also couldn't get the audio to work, so right now its can only work by text based utterances to Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a game together, even if its not working fully
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    expanded on programming knowledge, and how to use Alexa Skills developer. Learned how to deal with problems we come across more effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Interactive_adventure_game_through_Alexa - perhaps making the graphical interface and making the audio work.
