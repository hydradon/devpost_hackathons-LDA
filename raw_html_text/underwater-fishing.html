                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fruit Ninja is one of my favorite game cause I would like to play games when I am stressed out and tired, and Fruit Ninja is so simple and real so that it does kill my pressure. In this way, I want to make a game with simple mechanics and pressure killing in an underwater experience.
