                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I attended an android workshop during the hackathon and I'm interested in making a game that is similar to TicTacToe.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a fencing game. When you enter the game, you will join a two-people room. If you are the first one in the room, you are Hamlet. If you are the second, you are Laertes. Each fencer will take their movement. You can move forward 1 unit, move forward 2 units, move backward 1 unit, or stay. Once two fencer collides, the judgment will take place. 
The rules:
+2 &gt; +1; 
+2 &gt; -1; 
+1 &gt; 0; 
0 &gt; +2; 
-1 &gt; 1;
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I looked at Professor Daniel Domen's sources codes and I made a similar source code structure. I imported his aia file as an example and build an app similar to his. The game was built on MIT App Inventor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tried to establish a Google cloud server so I can host the web game but the set up was too complicated. And it took me a while to learn about PHP.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now I'm into android now!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about the network structure behind a simple web-based game. I experimented setting up Google Cloud and learned a little about PHP and SQL

                <p>
                    More fencing modes such as Foil Mode, Sabre Mode, Epee Mode.
