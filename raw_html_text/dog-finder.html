                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have experienced being away from our pet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dog Finder uses NFC data chips and social networking to allow dog owners feel at ease when they're away from home. Proof of concept uses an NFC attached to the dog's collar to keep count of the amount of times he or she approaches they're water dish. If the dog doesn't drink any water for a set period, the app sends a message to the owner alerting them of the issue. It then offers the user to input their dogs information which will be ported to our database with GPS coordinates through Google's Map API. Users who find stray dogs can also punch in the dog's information. The app then aggregates this data to link distressed owners of possible matches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and Java to build the base app. We used Eclipse and Google Scripts to setup our database. The NFC component is still in progress and remains in our proof of concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first time using Android Studio and developing phone apps. The use of NFC into android logic proved to be a complex design into our app, which will require more time for us to fully implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully developed a working phone app within 24 hours of ever using Android Studio. All of us are engineering students with limited experience with web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to solve a complex problem as a team, by breaking the main goals into smaller tasks under deadline. We also got a great experience in learning how to develop apps using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dog Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Over the next two months, we'll finish implementing the NFC features of the app, first by studying how these chips can be used to generate intents for Android activities, and then by designing and building prototype models. We'll also work on cleaning up the database to allow it to effectively interact with the app.
