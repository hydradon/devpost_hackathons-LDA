                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it easier to see exactly how users interact with your application in a visual and metaphorical way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LogBlocks is designed to run on any web server, and parse and store request data from the most common apache and nginx log formats. The Unity application, running on an external client, then pulls this request data, and visualizes it graphically on the Oculus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LogBlocks consists of 3 parts: A dummy API, a logrotator, and the Unity application for Oculus. We also built an application that generates fake requests for the purpose of generating data for the demo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever the dummy API is hit at any of it's endpoints, the request, response code, and response time are stored in an Apache access log. Data is continually pulled by the logrotator service, which parses and rotates the logs; storing the relevant data in Redis. Whenever the Unity application is run, data is pulled from the log search API, which is then visualized as interacting blocks on the Oculus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Redis and Azure configuration was difficult.

                    It works.

                <p>
                    How to develop applications for the Oculus, and how to parse, store, and manage big data in a fast and efficient way.
