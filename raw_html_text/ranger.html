                    Ever want to know more about a cool landmark in a park? Look no further! Ranger allows for the use of beacons in order for parks to mark landmarks and allow interaction from park attendees.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takashi designed and built the iOS app in Swift using Gimbal beacons.
Andrew designed and built the API in Ruby on Rails.
Bianca and Benji designed and build the admin panel in vanilla JavaScript with Mapbox.

                <p>
                    ArcGIS was a pain.
