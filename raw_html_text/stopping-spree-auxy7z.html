                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students, we realized that the biggest issue with money is managing it. In addition, we have also experienced student debt and saw stories of people taking decades to pay off their student loans. Using our application, we wanted to give users a sense of how long it will take to pay off of their student debt, in addition to the other daily expenditures such as food and entertainment. We wanted to show the student, or any individual really, an analysis of their data, with a visual, not just numbers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application allows the user to be able to submit how much they want to allocate each month for categories that exist on TD Da Vinci API. Using TD Da Vinci, we were able to have data for user history for transactions in addition to lots of other crucial data such as annual income and student loan, simulating a typical individual, possibly a recent graduate. We have sliders for the individual to indicate how much of their monthly budget they would like to allocate to certain expenditures.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Firebase for the user creation and authentication, javascript to hit the TD Da Vinci API to get data back from the virtual customers. In addition, we utilized Chart.js to create analytical graphs for the users.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized quite late that there were a lot of browser limitations, especially when dealing with cross-tab html data. We pivoted last minute to something else that was a web application, a bit more aligned with the skills that our team had.
