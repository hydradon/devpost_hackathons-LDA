                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an applcation to help people do speeches, especially public speaking through the use of music to empower their speeches and make them more colourful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works like a karaoke machine where you need say a bunch of stuff in a certain amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the whole thing using python, even the gui!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python is notriously bad at doing gui and modifying.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't use python for audio, otherwise it's a niche language
                </p>
