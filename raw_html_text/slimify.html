                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted an app that could tell which exercises to do to burn the most amount of calories.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Android app tells you what sequence of exercises you need to do, given the number of calories you want to burn in the amount of time you're willing to spend exercising.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was built with Java, using the Xamarin and Android Studio software. Xamarin was programmed in C#, but I converted it into java for our final project in Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saving data locally on the phone was very difficult. When a user was added in the app, all his/her data had to be saved and restored even when the app was closed. We used SQL, but it was a very manual process since there were very specific commands that had to be used in order to make it work. Xamarin kept on having random bugs pop up that would sometimes take 30 minutes to solve. Tutorials for learning the Xamarin syntax weren't very helpful and I had to learn most of it myself by playing around with samples from the internet. Towards the end when I was trying to finish the timer/calorie page the app kept on crashing. I fixed it when I stopped sending an integer value to a string.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of my ability to making a functional app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use SQL to save data locally on the phone. I also learned how to utilize loaders and RecyclerViews to display a list of all the users who have used the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Slimify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan on making the graphics look nicer. I would also like to add a swiping feature in addition to the "next" button. Additionally, there are some logic functions that I need to finish implementing. Furthermore, I want to add more specific exercise options for the user.
