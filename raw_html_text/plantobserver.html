                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Worried about no one takes care of your plants when you are on vacation?
Always forget about watering your plants?
Not Sure how much of water your plants need?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here is the automatic plant watering system. It's a design that automatically watering your plant and an interface interacts with users. It can self-detect low humidity as well as high temperature so that the plant can be watered according to the water level of the plants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use MXChip as the microcontroller. The on-board temperature and humidity sensors are used to detect the humidity of the plant. Meanwhile, the data, through Azure IoTHub, is sent to the cosmos database.  From the database, a front-end interface built by typeScript handles the user interaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We met challenges when we are trying to set up the front end as well as the communication between the micro-controller and the cosmos database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully made the board display the correct temperature and humidity data. We also manage to send the message to users by using twilio api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implement a project is made of many of the small steps. It requires teamwork, team coloration, and consistently coding and communication with teammates.
