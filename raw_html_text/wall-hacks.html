                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're just a couple guys, trying to make dough and support our expensive lifestyles, as tech addicts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a very life-changing application. It is online, and you are able to battle in top-down fashion. The gameplay is simple, defeat other enemies (Your friends) with your guns, and you are able to move up through different weapons. If someone kills you though, you are reset back to the basic weapon. If you run out of ammo, your only option is to use your handy whip to kill and steal ammo from enemies. One more thing, the walls are close, and they can assist or they can hurt you! The walls are a strategic tool to be used at your disposal! Play and find out!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through blood, sweat, tears, monster, and a few caffeine overdoses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Git does not work with Unity. Period. Sleep is not optional unlike what we tell ourselves. We did have a bit of a learning curve to learn Unity, but we overcame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Online multiplayer definitely feels like an accomplishment. We are proud that we had a playing party the night before our implementation was due, by playing with a group of people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is actually really awesome, and it is much better to work on a team of people at a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wall Hacks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add procedurally generated levels, so every time you play is a different map!
