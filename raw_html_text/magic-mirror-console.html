                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to do this because we went through the process of setting up a smart mirror many times through the command line, so we wanted to create a more easily accessible user interface so more people can make their own Magic Mirrors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Magic Mirror Console provides a user friendly interface to show and hide modules. It can also translate the modules to different languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our own custom module for Magic Mirror and ran a web age on localhost which allowed us to send API calls to localhost and trigger events in the Magic Mirror environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took us an unseemly long time to decipher how to send information from the Magic Mirror environment to the web console and back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an API to toggle modules on and off through our web console and to have the ability to extend the calls to more advanced usage, such has installation and movement of modules.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to make make custom API calls. Apply user interface skills to a web page.

                    What's next for Magic Mirror Console
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adding scripted installation of modules and the reformatting of them using buttons on the console page. 
Cleaning up UI and adding additional accessibility features for the handicapped.
