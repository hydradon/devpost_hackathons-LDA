                    VirtualEyes is a simple way to give young gamers a very important tool for life; also giving households an easy way to diagnose such health problems, which are very easily neglected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    VirtualEyes is programmed to use Virtual Reality in order to do a quick Snellen test. It tells the user the power of the lens which the user should be wearing.

                <p>
                    The program was based on a Mathematical proof that the power of the lens is related to the distance a person would move in order to read something which is too small for him. Unity 5 and a little C# was used to make use of the Oculus Rift.
                </p>

                    Neither had I ever used Unity, nor had I coded in C# before yesterday. More than that, I had never even touched a VR system. Learning how to use these 3 took a lot of time and that was the most challenging thing I faced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am proud of not quitting. Starting with HoloLens, to Vive, and finally being able to produce something which is logical and would help people a lot, is what I am proud of the most.

                    This was my first Hackathon and I learnt how to socialise with nerds and geeks. I learnt how to develop in VR using Unity 5 and would love to continue doing it.
                </p>

                    VirtualEyes is a very logical and simple program. It can be used by anyone. It can become way more efficient and accurate. It can be used to provide eye care in a better way. In fact, I really want to make a cardboard version so that it becomes a viable solution for people. This is what I'm planning to do with it now.
