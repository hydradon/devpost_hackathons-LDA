                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every single summer, the San Jose Public Library distributes food among kids who are not able to receive food during the summer due to economical challenges they may face. However, the process of ordering and managing the food was tedious and inefficient because it required a plethora of paperwork.  We want to reinvent the way that the meal system works for the San Jose Public Library by reducing the use of paper and making the process more streamlined.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have crafted an elegant solution to a common problem faced by the library. Our goal is to allow for an easy, seamless way to organize data and analyze trends, enabling a better way to track meals and save money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an Android application which stays synced to a realtime Firebase database. This will manage and store all data regarding the management of food and simplify the process.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges syncing the app with Firebase and doing authentication. One thing we also struggled with was displaying the data in a user friendly interface which reduces paperwork.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to implement a signature system on the phone because that was very technically challenging.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about databases and that showing something is better than nothing.
