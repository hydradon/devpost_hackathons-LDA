                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project was seeing how difficult it is to compare two different candidates. You have to research and find articles for each one and it takes a long time. We wanted to make this process easier. So we decided to do the research ourselves and present it in a format which makes evaluating your options for politicians a quick and simple process.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app displays political candidates' platforms. It provides specific topics and allows you to look at candidates' stance on those topics. It also allows you to compare different candidates. It also provides recent articles from both sides of the political spectrum about key topics.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using swift. We researched the political candidates using unbiased sources.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making buttons function correctly. At first, the buttons never worked after trying again, and again until they finally worked. Also combining the two versions of our project took some time as we had to figure out how to combine multiple Swift and Xcode projects into one.

                <p>
                    Finishing the application and having it function correctly.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    How to in Swift and in the Xcode interface. How to design a functioning application as a group

                    What's next for Simple-Politics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's still a lot of work for us to do. We plan to create a new tool that allows you to directly compare two candidates and see their similarities and differences. We also plan to make our news constantly update by incorporating the New York Times API into our app. We plan to add more candidates and more topics to the app as well.
