                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While attending an Ethereum DevCon and learning about Kyber, I was thinking about how to increase adoption. Making trading and investing social is a great passion of mine and I combined these two in my vision for Mirian, where anyone can invest and trade together with their friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our engine (that is integrated with Kyber) creates what we call "Social Wallets" shared by friend groups. Friends can take action and make trades and investments with Eth into this Social Wallet, where a leader designates a single or portfolio of coins to buy from Kyber. Individuals have the option to withdraw their coins anytime to their wallet as well, but this is a great way to retain visibility into what coins your friends are trading and investing in and do it with them. Our mobile app makes it intuitive to use and provides a good UX for monitoring and managing coins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Combination of remix, ganache, solidity, and Openzeppelin which was our favorite tool. Our team has also come up with an iOS app which was written in react-native and uses web3.js and Infura for Ethereum interactions. We use "serverless" lambda architecture and users generate and keep their keys on device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our iOS app is currently being tested on Testflight and will be on the appstore in November. Please reach out

                        murat@mirian.tech
                    </a>
                    and we can give you testflight access if you want to take a look and use it!

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've had gas and solidity issues for this project. Particularly, when a user tries buying too many kinds of coins in their social wallet from kyber, we got errors and reverted transactions. After overcoming this mysterious technical challenge that wasn't easy to debug, we ran into some gas issues both with cost of transaction and gas used per transaction. We've reduced it to an acceptable amount for now but we're planning to optimize it additionally. We also ran into some web3 library bugs while interacting with our engine through the Mirian iOS app that posed a challenge, but overall we're happy with the outcome of this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned a lot! Not only gained additional technical and operational wisdom but we've deployed not just a dapp but a dapp engine natively integrated with a decentralized exchange (Kyber!) to Ethereum mainnet! A few of our users testing our iOS app have launched social wallets and bought coins from Kyber seamlessly. We believe in a tokenized future so it was an amazing milestone for our team that we're very proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Particularly learned more on improving development and testing skills for Ethereum mainnet. Gas optimized development is more efficient than developing and testing then optimizing for gas. Our team also learned a lot on the finances and economics of how decentralized exchanges work and interact with users. I learned on managing time effectively as we've had an ambitious goal for this hackathon, and to plan better in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mirian
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The launch of our iOS app on the appstore!! We're SUPER excited for it as it has been a long time coming. It's the first Ethereum wallet of its kind because it's Social; where you can follow friends and trade together! And yes it's natively integrated with Kyber! Isn't that awesome?
