                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After playing around with the Muse we wanted to make a graph out of the data we've received to see if we were able to come up with some sort of reasonable connection with the various Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Theta waves we saw.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This web app converts the data we collected from the Muse headband into graphs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Microsoft's Azure API in order to launch a website with an operating backend. The backend was integrated with the Muse using the SDK in order to project its data with d3 libraries and Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data from Muse was a nightmare. We received a overwhelming quantity of data types for which we were unable to come up with an effective algorithm or program that was able to search and select only the data we want automatically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By the end of it, we were all experts at something. Alex was able to draw any graphs from any sorts of data. Chi and William was able to understood the basics of how Azure works and backend and front-end together. Michael could collect, read, and analyze the data we received from the Muse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CalMuse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that in the future we would able to come up with something that would read and export the data automatically for us. If we are able to do so, we can just put on the Muse device and have it create the graph live.
