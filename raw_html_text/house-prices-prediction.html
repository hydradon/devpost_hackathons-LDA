                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from a Kaggle competition that tasked us with predicting Airbnb rental prices in New York City.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our model creates a prediction for the sales price of houses in three states: Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a gradient boosting algorithm to take into consideration different features both from the dataset we were given and some that we feature engineered ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were in a constant battle against time. Running prediction models can be time-consuming, and we spent most of our time feature engineering variables while we could have paid more attention to the tuning of our model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many things that we will bring home from this experience: an absolute sense of confidence in our capabilities, the awareness that we have the grit to succeed and the satisfaction of having made it to the end of the challenge in the best mood and spirit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that no task is too large for our group!
                </p>

                    What's next for House Prices Prediction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An in-depth tuning session! There is a lot to be done and we are excited to get our model up and running to minimize our RMSE.
