                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a website because I haven't done it before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users to post survey questions and answer those questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote it using only Javascript with Express.js backend and React.js frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time writing a website with both frontend and backend I had to learn how to piece it together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was able to set up a website in about a day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can build a website with just Javascript, but I still have a lot more to learn.
                </p>

                    What's next for InquireNow
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will be trying to add MySql to store the data.
