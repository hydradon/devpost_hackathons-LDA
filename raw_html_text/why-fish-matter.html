                    My inspiration was based on the need to understand how to prevent fish extinction.

                <p>
                    The community will be involved in a program that raises awareness on how to prevent over-fishing and how to replenish the fish population.

                    My challenges were the limited time to research this topic and providing more detailed information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest accomplishment that I'm proud of is how some of my members were interacting with this topic, which made it more creative and educational for all.

                <p>
                    I learned how to understand the limitation of fishery and how it is necessary for a community for survival.

                    The future of Why Fish Matter is to continue its mission to provide programs to the community to best serve the economy.
