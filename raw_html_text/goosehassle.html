                    Welcome to GooseHassle. We are a team of like-minded and determined individuals, all sharing a vision for the future of fueling. With&nbsp;about 12,000 gas stations&nbsp;within Canada, we believe that our sophisticated technology has the potential to become an industry sensation.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GooseHassle was founded by a group of friends who started by drinking too much coffee and decided that stepping out of cars isn't the way to fuel up.
In fact, our solution lets you sit without freezing yourself as your robot will fuel up for you.
