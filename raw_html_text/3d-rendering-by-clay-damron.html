                    Hello, my name is Clay Damron.  I'm an aspiring environment artist and technical artist from Austin, Texas.  I am currently a senior in the Arts and Entertainment Technologies program at UT.

                <p>
                    I decided to go with the theme of Halloween for this rendering.  I spent about ten hours working on the model, about four hours working on the textures, and another six hours rendering everything and working on the video.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every item is made manually - each leaf had to be placed individually, and every detail was either sculpted in or made via polygonal modeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm absolutely thrilled that my lean production workflow has enabled the completion of this project in such a short period of time.  Thank you, everyone!
                </p>
