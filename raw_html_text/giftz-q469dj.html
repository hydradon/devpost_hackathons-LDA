                    Inspiration (we want Wyoming to build the first State wide Consumptive Token Economy - leading other states to do the same)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - we have two services 1) Business Token As A Service that manages the life cycle of business tokens that have consumptive value in Wyoming ecosystems, 2) A Marketplace for those Business tokens to trade
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it (We built the Wyoming Exchange on EOS, with Javascript and HTML)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into (Lack of EOS tokens for such a large contract)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of (48 hours we built a working Exchange and Minted 1B GOWYO Tokens )
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned (we learned how to write and deploy an exchange on EOS)
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Giftz (we are raising $3M to grow our infrastructure)
