                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have You ever been in the situation when you are sure that you want to go somewhere, but You are not sure where? Until this day You had to spend hours or maybe days on researching or go and pay to the tourist agency. If You are not quite satisfied with these two options, then You might have thought how great would it be if someone just knew you so well, so he/she can find you a most suitable place without explaining everything. We took that idea, and now you need only a few clicks to find you the next destination. However, you might expect this to be expensive. What if we tell you, that we want to help you to save some money, and we will find you the cheapest route and time specifically for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application first requests from a user to login with a Facebook account. Then, the algorithm will scan all of the information regarding the places from user's posts, pictures, geo-tags, location on posts he has been tagged on. To be short, we can find a lot of information about the user. We use all of that to find travel preferences of the user. The last thing that user will have to do, is to enter a budget. Then we use our database of approximately 400 places, that are categorized by types of experiences you can get there, and we find the best trips for you. We check all of the prices for these trips and provide you with the cheapest options. All user has to do after that, is to go book a flight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Graph API to pull the information from users. Then we created a database of places, that are considered as interesting by Trip-Advisor. The last part is done using Skyscanner API, which finds us the cheapest possible tickets for most relevant routes, and we sort them again considering both price and potential user's interest.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for NewTravel
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we want to make the interface of the application even better. We will improve its functionality, and we will bring more customization for the trip. We plan to add options for choosing the number of places you want to visit. Another feature we are planning to add is the option for including the booking. When we will have more users that we have at the moment, we will be able to categorize places even more precise. Integration with other services like TripAdvisor or social media aside Facebook is also a thing we plan to implement in the close future. And finally, we want to improve our information seeking algorithm, so we will get even more travel information for every user we have.  Additionally, machine learning can be implemented if we achieve to collect a big data set that we can use for training.
