                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students at university, we know that sometimes it's difficult to follow the rythm of the lectures, and reviewing it at home alone can be a daunting task. Therefore, we wanted to created an interface that allowed students to rate their level of understanding of each lecture, and that helped them find other students who are willing to give them a hand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grasp is a website where students can rate from 1 to 10 their level of understanding of each lecture. Afterwards, low-rating students can request help of others while high-rating students can volunteer as mentors. Besides, it is possible to access the mean rating of each lecture, so students can know where they are compared to the rest of the class and teachers can keep track of how are their lectures being received.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Angular to design the web interface and Go for the back-end. We used an http connection layer to comunicate between the two. We used the library RxJS to implement the asynchronicity that comes with this kind of connection. We also used SCSS and the Materials library to design the UX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have much experience with Go or Angular, so we had a hard but exciting time developing the interface. We struggled particularly when we had to combine the back-end and front-end and manage the requests of each part.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that our website is simple but very functional, and we're specially proud of the graphic design. Besides, we're also proud to having been able to build a complete product from scratch, when we didn't have much experience in front-end engineering.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about making websites, particularly about how to link the front-end with the back-end, something that we didn't have any experience in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Grasp - an educational solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The community part of the website is still under construction, and we need to finish the interface that allows students to comunicate among themselves and to modify the subjects they are enrolled in. It would also be interesting to incorporate a profile type for teachers (so they have access to the mean rating of their classes, and adjust their teaching accordingly), and to add the option of sharing your notes of the lecture.
