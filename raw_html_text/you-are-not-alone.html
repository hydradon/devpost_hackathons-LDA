                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Awareness of socially stigmatized issues made us realize that people suffering from these conditions often face isolation and feel like they are alone dealing with these problems.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first purpose of our site is that it provides a safe-space for people suffering from these stigmatized issues where they can read about similar experiences. The second purpose is that it provides a platform for users to share their heartwarming messages that ultimately lets other users know they are not alone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a fullstack website hosted on Google Firebase. To do this, we implemented a Javascript/Node.js server, hosted on Google Cloud Functions, to manage REST calls between our front-end site and our Google Realtime Database. We also implemented a simple UI design for our website with Javascript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, we had trouble getting started and implementing the base of our project, Firebase. It took us a while to understand how to use REST APIs to talk to our front-end and our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we finished our project and implemented a fullstack functioning website, that works as we had intended it to. It was great to be involved in creating a webservice from the ground-up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned, first and foremost, a great amount about web-services, REST APIs, and serving dynamic data. We also, however, learned more about these marginalized people who suffer from stigmatized illnesses/conditions. Doing this hackathon has given us a new and important perspective to consider.
                </p>

                    We will definitely continue to polish and fine-tune our service, adding more details and features.
