                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With team members coming from diverse backgrounds in finance, fashion, cryptocurrency, and web development, we were inspired to develop SNEAKYZY so that consumers can find and afford the shoes of their dreams, and so professional resellers can continue to sustain themselves in the current period of maturation and optimization in the sneaker industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are turning sneakers into a liquid commodity by leveraging a disruptive fee structure that encourages higher volume and lower prices. By allowing for instant, fee-lite transactions, we are aligning previously mismatched incentives between buyers and sellers, leading to an optimal user experience.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When one of our team members dropped out halfway through the hackathon, we were forced to improvise and search for a new developer, costing us valuable time and bandwidth.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the power of perseverance and grit in the face of overwhelming odds, as well as how to adapt on the fly to difficult situations and unforeseeable occurrences.
