                    We wanted to make a game. However, it's our first experience in game development, therefore we decided to create a game with a simplistic art style, similar to limbo. We wanted to try and recreate an atmospheric and somewhat creepy experience that Limbo was able to capture. At the same time, we understood that our ambition to create such a game in just three hours, with our limited experience, was a long shot! Hence we were also inspired by games such as 'The Binding of Isaac' created in game-jams of their own in extremely short time frames. This resulted in us learning how to use 'gamemaker' as a game engine and 'GIMP' for level design. The short time frame allowed us to appreciate the task to create quality games. Whilst under such time constraints we were unable to include an initial key feature of ours which was to use sophisticated light mechanics. Unfortunately, our constraints didn't allow us enough time to learn how to use open GL shaders. However, despite this, we were still happy to create a functional prototype of our initial level. We managed to design the level and character externally and then implement the separate code we wrote in gamemaker.
