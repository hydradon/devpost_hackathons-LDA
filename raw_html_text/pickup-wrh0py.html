                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A shared love for AI, social good, and childhood movies inspired us to create PickUp!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PickUp is a mobile app based on Pixar&rsquo;s motion picture "Up". Living in Paradise Falls, objects of color are sparse. Russell the boy scout needs help retrieving objects of a certain color for Carl--and as the user, you're going to help him! As the user have 20 seconds to take a picture of an object of the requested color. Every time you succeed at helping Russell, he gets a scout badge.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Thunkable to create the game storyline and most of the UI mechanics. To identify the colors in each image, we used Microsoft's Image Recognition API, which is called Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we had trouble matching the requested color with the image tags that Azure generated.
Another challenge we faced was perfecting the countdown timer feature; it would navigate to the timed-out screen even when the user successfully uploaded a picture containing the right color.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we could incorporate our nostalgic memories into our project and spread this love to the next generation. This fun interactive app is not only entertaining, but it's also beneficial to teaching colors to children. It was also incredible to overcome obstacles as a team through determination, persistence, and a good outlook.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we can overcome any obstacle life throws at us. We also learned that something as simple as the memory of a movie from our childhood can prompt us to create new connections with the people around us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PickUp
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we're incredibly proud of our project, we are always striving to improve! We would love to add other requested characteristics to PickUp, such as shapes (round, triangle, rectangle, etc.). We would also look into preventing repeated requests of the same characteristic (ex: "red" being requested five times in a row). Looking to the more distant future, it would be exciting to collaborate with Disney's Pixar on this project. Partnering with The Walt Disney Company would raise awareness about PickUp and hopefully create new learning opportunities for more children.
