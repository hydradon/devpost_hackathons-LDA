                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challange 1 and part of 2 of the Back End Challanges

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its an api and a very simple view where you can play a game of mastermind

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was built with node.js, express and mongoDB to create an api. The front-end is using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challanging part was time management, since I was in other projects in the marathon I had little time to dedicate to this one. It was also hard to build a good UI, but I decided to keep it very simple and focus on the backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am really proud of the API I came up with and its scalability to go from single player to multplayer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about API design and implementation, and a lot about the technologies I used, especially since some of them were very new to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mastermind Challange
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next part would be to improve its user interface and safe-proof the API, to give better returns for incorrets inputs.
