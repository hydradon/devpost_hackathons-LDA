                    The Back Story:
Inspiration:  Use to using WebMd which has the diagnosis, but our app will provide you with over the counter treatment and holistic remedies as well.  Additionally, it will map you to the nearest pharmacy and urgent care.  We will also provide you with drug- to - drug interactions.

                <p>
                    What we learned:
Ensuring we had the appropriate disclaimers- stating the app is not meant to take the place of seeking care from a trained medical professional
The difficulty of choosing common illnesses and symptoms to include in the app
Someone with a medical background is needed to verify the information is appropriate for the intended audience
                </p>

                    What is next for the app:
Chat box and phone number to speak with a medical professional
Community discussion board
