                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the recent disaster known as ECE 105 midterm, I realized a projectile calculator was required for exam prep and doing assignments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides an alternate method to solve the assignment questions and check your answer to the most common types of projectile problems; how far does it go and the initial velocity of the projectile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I looked at the problem from an algebraic point of view and formed a generalized solution to those problems. Then I translated the general solution into C++ code and optimizing the program by giving the user the freedom to provide the input using the information available to him.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Defining the error checks for the inputs and making the inputs interact the way they were supposed to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created two programs with efficient error checking and providing reliable answers to the user for the two most common problems of projectiles; how far does it go and the initial velocity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a beginner programmer, I learned methods for efficient error checking routines in the program and the overall organization of code using while loops and if-else statements.

                    What's next for Prof EDCOM
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To create more programs to solve physics problems including but not limited to energy conservation, momentum and collisions, waves and much more.
