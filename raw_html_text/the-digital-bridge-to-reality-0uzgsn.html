                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can go to 5 below and buy a VR headset for 5$. The problem with VR is that people get uncomfortable when away from reality too long. Other forms of AR only slap an image onto a video stream. I saw this and wanted to create a new form of AR that can actually bring computer generated models into the real world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The box uses a screen to project light onto an angled piece of glass (or in this case plastic) allowing the illusion of a 3D hologram in front of you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Box ingredients: An Activia yogurt box, some plastic from a cheap empty frame, lots of tape
Software: I used unity to manipulate the models in this case however the simplicity of the design allows developers to use any 3D platform they'd like, or even view video picture and text files in 3D space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity lighting bug - as I switched scenes the light in the scene went far darker
Space - Using a phone as a screen, space was tight. Additionally my current design requires the screen to be directly on top of  the box so that you cant look down on the hologram at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of each demo scene I created. For example, You can actually control the dragonfly wirelessly!! Princess Leia with audio!!!! Adorable bunny!!!! Ahhhhhh!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    24 hours slips by fast. Also OLED displays can display better on a hologram than LCD
Unity shortcuts and functionalities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Digital Bridge to Reality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given the right materials I could develop the "Vive" version of my hologram machine, complete with a quality build (thats not cardboard), and a screen dedicated for projecting holograms that connects to your computer via usb or hdmi. This would allow you to do more cpu/gpu intense projects on the box through your pc, not to mention this would allow the screen to be on as much as your computer without forcing you to give up your phone.
