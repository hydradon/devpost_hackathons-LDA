                    Inspiration : It is a very common problem for people with no technical background to learn about technology especially coding and despite having multiple sites and video tutorial available to teach,  still there is no one to answer your instant queries which sometime leads to lack of interest. We always reach out and look for people in groups who have expertise and can guide us instantly on the issues we are having development, or learning anything new.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does : The application actually let people barter trade their skills. Once you login you can choose your interest, the skills you want to learn and the skills you are good at and you can teach to others. The app help people not only connect online but also to connect on local meet-ups and request in person meeting of the instructor agrees.

                    How we built it : We use react native to target the both mobile users; andoid and ios. at first stage we will be targeting the android users and later on will add ios as well. There is Facebook messenger integrated with the app for messaging and connecting people outside the platform too.

                    Challenges we ran into : Mainly the process was smooth, however it tool time  to completely build the app and focus on core functionality. There are many modules that we couldn't integrate due to lack of time and are planning to execute afterwards.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We created the whole product from idea to execution in 18 hours. The idea was discussed at the hackathon and we implemented the simplistic model. From creating mockups to design to writing code and implementing it was done here at f8, which was quite an achievement for us.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned : The problem could have been studied before hand  in order to better create and implement the solution.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Skill Market : Adding features like Rating and review of users along with the recommendations of profile will be launched. For now its a barter trade system, but once a person has less time, he can also add some minimal charge for tutoring too, so that people value his/her time.
