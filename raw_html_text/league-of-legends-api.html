                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a problem that we wanted to solve. We wanted to know if people were playing One Trick Pony champions in league of legends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows a user to enter a username and the website will query the RIOT API to return JSON data values. We can use the values and compare them to see if you are a one trick pony. In addition, it is also able to show other relevant data such as rank, level, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in HTML and CSS. For the query params and routing, we used javascript and XMLHTTPrequests. The JSON requests could be parsed and passed to other files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time anyone in our entire team worked on a project with js, and API's. There was very little knowledge on JSONS and routing. We ran into some bumps with cross origin call denials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to say that we were able to get a fully functioning MVP + a little extra out the door in 19 hours in our first hackathon. It was most rewarding to pick up new technologies that we had never used before and go into a mad scramble to find out to solve problems together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that teamwork and communication can go a really long way. Although we were not the most experienced individuals in the room, we were able to function very well as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for League-of-Legends-API
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next would include match history, items, and more statistical data.
