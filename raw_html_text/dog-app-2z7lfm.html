                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After brainstorming for hours, we got frustrated trying to think of idea to work on at this hackathon. To take a break, we googled animal pictures and started looking at animal pictures to cheer ourselves up. It was then that we realized that this could be our hack idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows the user to view a random dog or cat photo that will hopefully brighten their day. If they still need cheering up, users can view more pics with a click of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote two modules to access the APIs for the random dog and cat photos and imported them into a third module that implemented TkInter to code our functions and create the user interface of our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into was getting the image from the API and using TkInter to display it.
Another challenge was getting the canvas to display the image after the button was clicked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of successfully requesting an image from an API, having the button perform properly, and displaying the images onto the window.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to send URL requests to access data from an API, how to use some of the many functions of TkInter, and how to integrate a button and an image on the same window by implementing a canvas
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dog App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Future developments for our app include buttons for specified animal pictures, the option to flip through previously viewed photos, and a setting menu so the user is able to choose their own background color.
