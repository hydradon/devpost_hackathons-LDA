                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the times you feel like screaming, but it also feels kind of unproductive

                    A simple game for tough times. Scream into the mic and throw an object at your opponent to win the game.

                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript and the p5js library to create the game and necessary animations. Through Snap Kit, the player can also access his personal Avatar and have even more fun throwing things.
