                    I did not have a team for this challenge, so my best efforts were spent on the back-end implementation.
I also created a simple front-end for testing purposes.
The demo can be accessed here:

                    </a>
                    The C# source of the Back-end implementation can be found here:

                </p>
                <p>
                    Please don't take in consideration the user interface/user experience because I made it as fast as I could just for testing purposes.

                    As requested in the instructions, here are my answers to your questions:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            What was the hardest part?
The hardest part was to implement the front-end for demonstration of the web API.
I am better solving problems at the back-end code.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
Would be "Read the instructions until the end!". I started developing the multiplayer system as a turn based game, but then I realized that the webservice had to return both responses at the same time only after both users sent their request.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If you could change something about this challenge, what would it be?
To require more software architecture and design patterns knowledge. I know it already required a little of knowledge about concurrent requests, but it think that design patterns and good practices are also very important, as I am used to work with DDD and TDD.

                    Looking forward for a job interview :)
Thank you.
