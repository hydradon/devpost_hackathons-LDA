                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was exploring the idea of anonymous loans marketplace for the people who work at the same company (eg. Lyft, Facebook) based on verification of their institution. I think it would be fun but the market for that is really tiny. And then I realized that this could applied to student loans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Current outstanding Student Loan debt is around $1.5 Trillion and growing. I think tokenizing it could bring more transparency to the marketplace and help improve rates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's also companies in Bay Area that started helping pay off student loans for their employees so I think this could be a great step forward.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's three parts:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Dapp that allows students create the loan and verify the identity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dharma relayer that has the list of all the loans available and allows you to fill them
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Graph Protocol subgraph that will be used in the future to help run queries on the loan data
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently the key components are
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Dharma Relayer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        0x.js for token conversions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dai.js to convert to Stablecoin
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bloom for Identity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Graph for queries
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Not currently in the codebase, but tried adding:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        NuCypher for proxy re-encryption of parts of loan data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Chainlink to do automated notifications upon contract changes and pulling in external data upon loan creation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bloqboard for loan scanning
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Due to time constraints had to cut down the scope significantly
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dai.js doesn't support TypeScript at the moment
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My limited experience with Dharma and 0x

                    <li>
                        NuCypher is currently only available in Python and Go so I didn't add it yet, but would be awesome to encrypt some of the data about the loans
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Didn't have enough time to implement Chainlink, but would be awesome to send out notifications once the loans are created
                    </li>
                </ul>
