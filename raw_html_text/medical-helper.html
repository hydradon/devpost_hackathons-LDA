                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has come to our attention that it is not an uncommon occurrence for people to be unable to acquire the medical assistance that they require purely due to inaccessibility. This is particularly the case for elderly people who live on their own and fall, and we wanted to try to find a solution to prevent this distressing situation from occurring. Also, I have a diabetic mother who, when in a hypoglycaemic episode, is unable to use her phone due to tremors and shaking. A rapid response and immediate medical attention is essential to prevent long-lasting damage.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our Alexa skill allows the user to call for medical assistance by voice command, without having the use their phone.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using Amazon's Alexa skill developer schema which linked our skill to a Python function hosted as a lambda on AWS, the call placing functionality utilised Nexmo's API via POST requests using the Requests library.
