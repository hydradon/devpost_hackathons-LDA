                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app capable of connecting people that share an interest in different places.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this app, people can connect with their google account and a display name. By targeting different locations, people can enter the location's chat room to talk with other users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to build a java application. We chose Firebase to host our chat servers and manage the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had multiple problems with our github project. For most of the time, we couldn't synchronize our projects because of the different settings installed on our computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using Android Studio and coding in Java. We also never had to manage any kind of database before. Still, we were able to accomplish our goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java, Android Studio, Google API, Firebase, Git Hub, Git bash, .XML. We also learned that it is important to set up our dev. environment before the competition.
                </p>

                    This was our first Hackatown, and we are sure to be be more prepared next time we come!
