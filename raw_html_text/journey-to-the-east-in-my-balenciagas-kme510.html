                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A couple of my friends and I were playing Dungeons and Dragons recently, and I had the idea of coding it out. As a lifelong RPG fan, I was excited to finally experience what it is like to create a game of this genre.  My friends were also down to do a project on it, and what better chance to do it than at HackUCI? Our game's theme and setting are very interesting as we literally put together different concepts we brainstormed. Imagine the Monkey King from China's famous legend "Journey to the West" wearing designer clothing and battling his way through post-revolutionary Communist China. Funny references to all of these origins could be seen during game-play. Furthermore, the game's UI is designed to replicate retro games like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.It was a great experience for me to work with my friends on something that inspires us so much.My team members supported each other throughout the process by brainstorming crazy ideas and coding them out..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It plays like any other RPG game with a menu system, navigated by point-and-click. You progress through a series of battles using various abilities and level up as you move forward, gaining stats and access to more abilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating an RPG game requires object oriented programming, so I decided to go with Python. With the various types of playable and non-playable characters, I created parent and sub-classes to recycle code. Then, my teammate integrated my code with Python's Tkinter to create a themed graphical interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The sheer amount of code that is required to create even a simple RPG is terrifying, especially under such time constraints. In addition, we had no prior experience with Python's tkinter, so we ran into difficulties to get it running as we pushed through learning curves..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding a fully functional text-based RPG game on my own within 2 days is a huge achievement for me as I have truly mastered Python's inheritance system. Furthermore, my teammates' understanding of HTML, CSS, and tkinter have greatly increased.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon thinking that my code was already bug-free, I asked my roommate to be our "Beta-tester" to see how the game runs. I was astonished at the amount of bugs that we ran into over and over again. Through this experience, I learned that code can never be truly perfect but we should always aim to make it as refined as we could within our ability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Journey to the East in my Balenciagas
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to move it to a more convenient system such as Pygame and implement it as a 2D side-scroller game like those that were popular in the 90's. New chapters, playable characters, and enemies will be created.
