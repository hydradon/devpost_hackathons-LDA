                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we think of going to a physical store, we realized that customers usually only have a few questions. One is that they want to switch phones / plans or learn more about T-Mobile in general.  However, after talking to several T-Mobile representatives, we learned that in many cases, customers may have long wait times or stay in store for longer because they are not sure what kind of phone they are looking for and suits them best. After hearing this, we wanted to create an in-store experience that customers could use to see which phone would be best for them in the case that employees are busy or the product was not available due to security reasons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We chose to use a more unique approach to this problem. Rather than,  in order to create a better customer experience. After much deliberation and communication with retail store managers, we decided that using VR / AR headsets is not a viable solution for a store setting. Thus, we took a headset and device-free approach to this problem.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a leap motion with Unity to be able to use hand gestures to demonstrate 3D models in the store. We used an amazon echo dot to have Alexa integration in our project.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we ran into is that we are all mac users, but we were committed to using the leap motion sensor because of its capability. However, after 6 hours of struggle, we realized that in order to use leap motion with Unity, it requires a certain version of compilation only available on Windows OS. Additionally, every Unity download we had to do took about an hour each due to the internet. We had downloaded it from before, but we were unaware leap motion requires an older version.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of coming to a VR/AR hackathon with almost no experience in VR/AR. We are to have been able to figure out how to use leap motion after many MANY hours of sweat and tears.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Unity with Leap Motion. We learned how to use the Amazon Alexa Dev Kits and AWS lambda.

                    What's next for 25-to-5
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to have this integrated in several Metro Stores, as this is a product that can truly revolutionize the customer experience.
