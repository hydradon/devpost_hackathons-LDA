                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found inspiration through reddit and bringing their concept into our app for the better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to create an app that acts as a community driven, cross platform application that promotes, increases, and organizes volunteer involvement in each environmental needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first made a prototype through the website proto.io and then we completed some of the core features in android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into was incorporating our idea to all three problems presented and then finding the common focus point between these three different problems to overall strengthen our pitch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group we were able to make the different components of what our app is suppose to look like through our prototype made in proto.io.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many things, one of which are any great tips to presenting a pitch to a panel of judges. We also learned new things about the environment around us plus its needs and dangers it currently facing. Lastly of course we learned of some new code that can very much be implemented into our future projects.

                    What's next for Lokahi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for Lokahi, we are going to code more of the user interface and the general feel for the app.
