                    News sites often bend research conclusions to present them in a certain light. I want to bring research directly to the consumer so that only facts are presented and people can read them without hassle! Science is important, so bring it to everyone!

                    The aim of the app is to use IBM Bluemix retrieve and rank API to search through given research, extract portions of the research such as the abstract, introduction, conclusion as well as relevant graphs/tables and present them in a beautiful way to be read by people of all backgrounds.
