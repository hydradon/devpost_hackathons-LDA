                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make an app that is useful in a real-life setting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app lets a company keep track of the payment/debt owned by their clients. The user is able to register and login using an email address and password. The user is able to add a new client to the database, edit the client info, and delete clients. A total debt amount owned is displayed on the top right corner of the page. The user also has the freedom of allowing the registration of the new user along with some other options.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I build this app using Angular 4 and Cloud Firestore as the database. My app is very secure in a way that it uses authentication guard for the routes. Some of the technologies I used in building this app are AngularFireModule, AngularFlashMessages, and Bootstrap CSS Framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had some trouble setting up my authentication guards to secure my routes, which prevents the none logged-In users from accessing certain pages/components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though this app looks easy on the surface, it required a lot of time and effort. I used near 10 components, a bunch of third-party technologies and I was able to pull it off in the end. That is something that I am very proud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to incorporate Firestore in a web app and how to deploy the app to firebase hosting service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Client Debt Management App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I would like to add a chat functionality to the app by allowing the company and their client to communicate in real-time on the site.
