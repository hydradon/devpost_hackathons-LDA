                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something that would help people to share their contacts and connect with people in a better, easier, and faster way, which motivated us to build this app.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scans your face and pulls up every information it has about you which you added to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the Google Cloud platform, Node JS, and MySQL.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would say working with Google Cloud platform was the hardest part as it was our first time working with it and it took us a while to figure things out. Also, it took us a while to figure out how to integrate everything and make a working model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming with a zero knowledge in Google Cloud platform, it was quite a step for us to get familiar with it and make something with it which actually works, and when in the end, it actually worked, it gave us a sense of achievement. Also, we are proud that we could make something that will make people's life easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot while making the app. Not just working with new things, but also, figuring out ideas with some social impact and developing things that help others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Face Place
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would say that we would try to make it better, and more updates as we get feedback and try to make it better.
