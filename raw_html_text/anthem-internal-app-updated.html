                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anthem's challenge was appealing and our team decided to tackle it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>

                    It allows company employees to evaluate their job satisfaction and other organization-related matters.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift 4 and Firebase 3 to create a mobile app that allows employees the flexibility to answer at their convenience.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Connecting the database to the code to update information in real time and implementing animations on swift 4. Furthermore, the GUI internal connections were tricky, however, we were able to make everything click before the deadline.
