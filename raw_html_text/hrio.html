                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind this bot is that I myself am pursuing internship and I really felt a need of such a bot to which I can just throw half cooked information I am looking for and it could direct me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two main services being served by this bot
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, to answers various queries of interns or new joinees
and second, encourage them to give feedback without sending a formal mail that most often is ignored.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mentioned on readme of github repo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have used Amazon Lex, Lambda and slack for this bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To understand the structure of intents from Amazon Lex. I was comfortable with idea and tech stack in general so using lambdas was not an issue but Lex was new for me so I really had to put in effort to understand how multi-intent architecture can work without hindering their respective functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>

                <p>
                    I learnt Amazon Lex + NLP in general.

                    This can be made more extensible to answer questions related to license such as am I allowed to download this software. Can be embedded with Amazon echo.
