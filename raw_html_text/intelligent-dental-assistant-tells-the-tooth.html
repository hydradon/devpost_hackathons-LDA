                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recent advances in application of deep learning to health domain have shown promising results, even beating human level accuracy in some tasks.  We believe that the dental field could use a new wave of research, and that collaboration between the deep learning community with dental professionals is a step in the right direction. As Andrew Ng said, "We have enough papers. Stop publishing, and start transforming people&rsquo;s lives with technology!"

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website demonstrates promising results of deep image segmentation applied to x-ray images of teeth.  We show the separation of different classes using color coded labels and describe useful use-cases of further work in this direction.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    During this weekend, our time was mostly spent on implementation of the
                    <a href="http://www-o.ntust.edu.tw/%7Ecweiwang/ISBI2015/challenge2/isbi2015_Ronneberger.pdf" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    .  The author achieved very good results for Biomedical image segmentation with a limited amount of training samples. We used a small open-source

                    </a>
                    of dental x-ray images. In addition to this, we spent some time to solidify the use-cases for this model, as well as related additional work.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is not so easy to go from neural architecture in the paper or even open source Github repository to a practical application.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team did not have much previous experience with image segmentation, and we learned a lot of new things through practice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to do multi class image segmentation and heavily augment a small training set.

                <p>
                    Further work includes improving the accuracy and robustness of the current model by using larger datasets, and exploring additional use cases such as anomaly detection and patient recommender systems.
