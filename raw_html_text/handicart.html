                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to improve the shopping experience for the visually impaired people and to help them avoid buying food items that could cause any allergic reactions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the help of azure and Matrix lab Creator board, we were able to implement a complex and powerful hardware solution which is rather easy to use.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Matrix Creator along with an RPI camera are the frontend of the project. This enable us to have a rather simple to use interface for the user. Azure is doing all the heavy lifting on the back. From facial recognition to object recognition to language translation. Everything is hosted on azure.

                    The technology used in this project has a lot more capabilities than we are using it for, This is just a prototype, an idea of what we could achieve which hardware and software. Our future goal is to expand it to make it more powerful.
