                <p>
                    An app for connecting donors to receivers and donation center managers. This is the back-end of the web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Who this app is for
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iDonate targets anyone who has clothes they are not using (can be later extended to additional products and services), people who are in need of donations and donation centre managers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iDonate has a different screen for each type of user. The donor can see the closest donation centers and each of them highlight the items they need. The receiver can see the closest donation centers and items offered at each. Managers can update their inventory, and set an inventory amount threshold at which to highlight items in need of donations. The repository you are in now is an incomplete prototype at this stage.
