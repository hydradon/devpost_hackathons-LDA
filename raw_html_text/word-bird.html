                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My wife is a first grade teacher. We wanted to come up with a skill for kids that would make learning how to rhyme fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When kids launch the skill by asking Alexa to open "Word Bird" it will ask them if they want to play. When they say "yes" it will give them a word (e.g. "car") and ask them to say a word that rhymes with it (e.g. "far"). If an incorrect answer is provided, Alexa will re-prompt reminding them of what the word is. Once a correct guess is provided, Alexa congratulates them on their victory with a fun interjection. Alexa tells them how many more words they need to rhyme until they have a dance party. After five correct answers, Alexa plays fun music for kids to dance to and then asks them if they would like to play again.
