                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One in five women and one in 16 men are sexually assaulted during their college careers. An example that hits close to home for many of us is OSU student Reagan Tokes, who was raped and murdered last year after being abducted walking to her car. It is clear that young adults on campus are in need of a backup plan for these situations in the event that their phone is inaccessible, so we set out to find an advancement for current solutions to this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An alert button is sewn discretely in the pocket of a unisex jean jacket for the user to push in the event of a dangerous situation. When the button is triggered, the application will silently notify an emergency contact and provide the GPS location of the user, unbeknownst to the attacker, and preventing escalation of the situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We produced the jacket by taking two preexisting denim jackets and borrowing design elements from both to create the perfect unisex jacket design. We created a pattern from this, and sewed it using an industrial sewing machine. For the technology, we used express.js, socket.io, raspberry pi GPIO, python, httplib, android location manager, and SMS manager.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team faced challenges early on in finding a developer for our idea, as we are three designers with little knowledge of hardware or programming. Although we eventually found one, he then faced challenges when the bluetooth hardware could not compile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we worked relatively well as a team together, and there were no negative comments or critique during nay part of our development. In addition, we are proud that this project addresses an issue that each one of us is passionate about, and that our passions led us to experiment with unfamiliar software and new ideas that we hope manifested themselves into an exciting final presentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each of us walked away with different skills and snippets of wisdom from this Hackathon. Katie learned how to do 3D modeling in Photoshop, as well as design a template for a 3D- printed item. Liz realized a newfound respect for developers and coding, as well as a new desire to learn the ins and outs of programming for her next Hackathon. Kiara was introduced to an industrial sewing machine, which quickly became her best friend during the making of our wearable-tech piece. Finally, Alex told us he learned not to trust anything other than first-party Arduino products, which may or may not have added to his workload as the developer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Threads, Not Threats
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Threads, not Threats, has a rich opportunity to expand into a full line of products in the industry of Wearable Tech; individual alert buttons as well as a range of accessories with alert buttons built in. In addition, we plan on including bluetooth support for situations beyond the range of a typical campus Wi-Fi, and, further, 4G embedded alert buttons for full capabilities anywhere in the world.
