                    There are countless social media sites dedicated to helping people keep in touch with their friends, but not many that prioritize meeting new people. We wanted to create a platform that would bring communities closer together in a unique way: by forging bonds between complete strangers.

                    Flock is a website designed to help people find others who are interested in the same event or activity. Any user can create a public invitation to an event (e.g. an outing to the Museum of Science in Boston or a night out at Middlesex Lounge). Once created, other users can view the event and choose whether or not to accept the invitation. This makes it easy to hang out with new people who have similar interests, and brings together community members that otherwise might never even meet each other.
