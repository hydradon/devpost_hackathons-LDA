                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being students, we were looking for something to remind us when we are spending too much.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes photos of receipts and analyzes the data to find trends and provide alerts about financial issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bl&uuml;Board is built using Python, Azure, Firebase, React.js, TypeScript, Node, and NPM.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was putting all the different components together, as well as working within a short time constraint, with little knowledge of what we were doing. None of us had ever used Firebase
                    <strong>
                        or
                    </strong>
                    Azure before this hackathon, and so there was a massive learning curve, especially because Firebase and Azure are the underpinnings of our web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all massively proud of the fact that we actually finished on time! We haven't used the technologies that we did before, so we're just proud that we learned them relatively quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us learnt time management skills, not to mention all the knowledge about our libraries!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bl&uuml; Board
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to extend out into the mobile market more.
