                    <li>
                        We started by building an application that could send and receive SMS messages using Twilio.

                    <li>
                        Firebase was then used to setup a database to store vital user information such as location

                    <li>
                        Various weather API's were used to retrieve relevant weather information such as drought status and weather advisories

                    <li>
                        We ran into problems with finding APIs that contained agricultural data. We decided to just stick with weather APIs and demo the app with some mock data in addition to the API.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also had trouble setting up the database at first, but we got it working once we started working with Firebase.

                        Figuring out what information was relevant for farmers and how to display the data in a clear and concise matter.

                        We would like to incorporate accurate predictive modeling, and develop a crowd sourced API for relevant information to be spread more easily. We hope that eventually, farmers can input information local to other farmers.
