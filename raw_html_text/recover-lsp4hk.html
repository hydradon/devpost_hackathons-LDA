                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A friend was building a connected bag and was looking for a solution to protect his bag from loss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While trying to help him, it occurred to me to create this service that would incentive people to return lost items to their owners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I checked some metrics about lost items and apparently in a global view, it matters:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        600 &agrave; 700 items/day that's the number of items give back to the lost and found service in Paris. Imagine this figure on a global scale!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More 15000 computers/week are lost in Europe and US airports!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        1 Billion euros/year, this is the value of the lost items loses by children in France. It represents about a 1000-ton mountain!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I hope this service can reduce this mountain and
                    <strong>
                        decrease stress
                    </strong>
                    about the loss and also
                    <strong>
                        unnecessary consumption
                    </strong>
                    (bought new items to replace those that were lost).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It incentives people to give back their items with a reward and an escrow smart contract.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I followed these steps:
                </p>
                <h3>
                    1) Smart contract development
                </h3>
                <p>
                    See the code source
                    <a href="https://github.com/blockchain-mafia/recoverto-contracts/blob/master/contracts/Recover.sol" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/blockchain-mafia/recoverto-contracts/blob/master/contracts/Recover.sol
                    </a>
                    This is a smart contract backed by a decentralized court (Kleros) to prevent a dispute between the finder and the owner.
All critical data (like contact information) are encrypted and are only available for the finder.
To improve the UX, I thought a system to claim the discoverer of the item without eth. The idea is to prefund a wallet with a small amount, just the gas to call a transaction, and put the private key in the QrCode.
                </p>

                    2) Prototyping on figma
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I designed the interface and the user flow on figma (software like Sketch).
                </p>

                    3) Integration with React and Drizzle
                </h3>
                <p>
                    For the UI, I used react with Drizzle (web3) to update "easily" the UI with the Ethereum state.
And also use a lambda-function to store email/phone number to notify the owner when there is a claim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (this service is centralized but the user can choose to create his bot to be notified to avoid to use this service)

                    4) Iterations
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Then I made lot of iterations: UX tests, fix bugs, add view functions in the smart contract and test, test, test.

                    In using Ethereum this project is by default interoperable any entities, private or public, can use. And also because this project is completely decentralized both in terms of architecture (Ethereum + IPFS) and governance (no ownership in the smart contract), this project is trustless. This is one less barrier to its implementation.
