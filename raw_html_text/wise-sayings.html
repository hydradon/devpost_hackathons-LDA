                <p>
                    I wanted to create and Alexa skill and become more aware of the tools Amazon was bringing. I also wanted to test out AWS Lambda.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built out Wise Sayings from modifying the template for an Amazon Alexa skill. I created an AWS Lambda function that is triggered when the Wise Sayings skill is invoked by a user. This Lambda is written using Node.js

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The skill was pretty straightforward. The hardest part thought was figuring out what would invoke the skill as Alexa was not able to interpret the phrase "wise sayings" correctly at points.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I was able to learn how to work with AWS lambda and get to test out the Alexa skills kit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that a basic Alexa skill is fairly easy to setup and that the current best use for Alexa is another form of search and information retrieval for humans. For my next project I will be creating a kind of niche search engine that is focused around Alexa.

                <p>
                    Next I would like to add more phrases to it in the future.
