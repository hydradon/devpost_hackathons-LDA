                    Do you need a pickup line to impress someone cute you see, but don't know any of your own? Let Sweet Talk help! Sweet Talk is an Android app that gives you a pseudo-randomly-generated pickup line with the touch of a button. Choose from a variety of types, like old-standard pickup lines, or lines related to science or tech.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to create the app, using the languages Java and XML.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge for all of us was figuring out how Android Studio worked with no prior experience. We only knew Java going into the project, so we spent a lot of time reading and watching tutorials on the internet. After some time, though, we each started programming individual components of the project using the knowledge that we gained in the first couple of hours, after which we tied all the components together to make the finished prototype.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a group with no prior app development experience, the fact that all of us managed to learn the ins and outs of Android Studio and produce a cohesive app in such a short period of time is something we're all very proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Java in sync with XML, use of "activities" in app development,  and elements of back-end and front-end development. We also improved our skills using Git source control and cooperative programming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sweet Talk?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we want to add network capabilities to this app. More specifically, we want to implement a full rating system, where users can vote on pickup lines, and better-rated lines are pulled more often. We also want to let users submit their own lines.
