                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half of our team members are passionate about music and the other half are passionate about art, so we combined our interests into a project that everyone had a part in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connect your computer to a MIDI keyboard and begin playing. On the screen, you'll see our visual representations of the notes you play, ordered by colour, distance, and size.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded it with C# in Unity and animated our own 3D models in Maya. it's connected to a MIDI keyboard and is built to be a VR experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several issues with unavailable plug-ins when handling MIDI in Unity. Also, exporting animations from Maya to Unity wouldn't work, so we had to find alternative solutions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're super proud of our idea and how quickly we were able to get certain aspects to the project together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using plug-ins with Unity and 3D modelling, some things we loved and some things we want to avoid in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bloom
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More flower variations/models and a stronger relationship between the notes played and the visuals that you see.
