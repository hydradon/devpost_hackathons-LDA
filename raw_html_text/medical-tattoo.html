                    Inspiration: Wanted to do a project using computer vision this seemed like a good idea
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: An android application that can scan and read encoded medical information stored within a tattoo
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used OpenCV and android studio to create our app
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: No prior computer vision experience on the team at all, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, did not know how to implement generalized hough transforms
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Generally the app works as intended when the idea was formed
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: Introduced to OpenCV and computer vision in general, the power of averages and blurring, and how to find circles in an image
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for medical tattoo: Introduce more complex shapes and optical character recognition to encode more information into the tattoo
                </h2>
