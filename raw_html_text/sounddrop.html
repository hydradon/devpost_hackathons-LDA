                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AirDrop for iOS is an outstanding way to quickly share files with nearby devices. This inspired my team and I to create a universal application that achieves a similar goal.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses sinusoid generation and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms to encode data as sound waves on one device, project the sounds to another device, and reconstruct the original message.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NodeJS is our primary language for easy integration into a website. The p5.js library was our saving grace, as it did lots of the heavy lifting in regards to the FFT algorithm, as well as displaying and manipulating our data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing appropriate frequencies was very difficult. Without enough time to integrate filtering algorithms for background noise, we were only able to effectively transmit data via high-frequency (and ear-aching) pitches. We also had lots of issues with fine-tuning our listener to ensure it stayed as accurate (and fast) as possible. This is what majority of our time was spent doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I feel much more confident in JavaScript than I did before. I can't recall the last time I've felt so stoked to see my code work. I practically jumped out of my seat when I saw the message perfectly reconstructed for the first time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Making it faster. Currently, we use base 16 with 16 different frequencies. We plan on using chords, which allows for 16 * 15 = 240 different "digits" to work with (we would implement a custom base-264 encoding). At the same transfer speed, this would increase our data transfer rate by a factor of 15! We also plan on redoing our algorithm to allow for emoji to be sent, because, well, who doesn't love emoji?
