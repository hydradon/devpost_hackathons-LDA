                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With both our parents being teachers, giving them an easier and safer way to communicate  outside of the classroom with their student is where the inspiration came from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a medium between students and teachers that allow them to communicate through one central phone number without ever exposing their private phone numbers. Any phone with SMS can receive and send messages allowing phone requirements to be unlimited. Allows teachers to set assignments or exam dates and will alert students at a set time before the assignment and exam will happen.
                </p>

                    Using a combination of Flask, python, and the twilio API's. To create the web app and having ngrok to allow us to quickly deploy our service.
