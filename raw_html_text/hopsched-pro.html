                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each member of our team is a student at Johns Hopkins University and each member understands the struggle of choosing classes. Countless hours spent trying to figure out which sections work best, what prerequisites we need, and how many morning classes we can avoid. This struggle and the new JHU ISIS API led us to work on HopSched Pro.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HopSched Pro takes a list of desired classes and generates an optimized schedule. No conflicts, no extra time spent and most importantly no morning classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the powers of python, flask, and teamwork.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall, the team has minimal programming experiences. This is the first real python project that 2/3 of the team worked on.
