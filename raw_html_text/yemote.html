                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to challenge ourselves to think critically about the written content we consume on a daily basis on the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app allows the user to upload a fragment of text and it will output the primary emotion of the text.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized IBM's Watson API, specifically the tone-analyzer. We then completed the web app using Node.js and other frameworks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially wanted to make this an android application, however we were ultimately unable to do this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to learn the basics of one of IBM's APIs, as these may allow us to continue with our other projects in creative ways.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use the node.js framework for JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for YEmote
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, we can also integrate the translation of audio files into a specific sentiment, including the primary emotion of the selection. We also hope to distinguish between different voices. Finally, we wish to put the application on a public or transition it into an android project.
