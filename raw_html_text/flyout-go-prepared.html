                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As people who travel often, either for leisure or for business, planning a trip each time is a hassle. Finding flights, finding places to visit, and knowing the weather condition there requires efforts of research (For example, I forgot to bring warmer clothes to Boston). We put these elements together to create FlyOut, a webapp that finds you the cheapest flight, local attractions, and weather tips.

                <p>
                    FlyOut is a webapp that finds you the cheapest flight, local attractions, and weather tips.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire platform's frontend is built on HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Backend was built using javascript and jquery. Amadeus API was utilized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming up with an idea was the hardest part. Coming into the hackathon not knowing what to build, we thought of how much travel has been part of our lives. We travel to go to hackathons, go meet friends, for work, and to have fun. We wanted to make planning for these a bit easier for our users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to finish brainstorming and building a product that works within 24 hours. This is my first 24 hour hackathon and it was definitely a challenge to do everything that we wanted to do.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's really hard to think of new ideas that relate to travel.

                <h2>
                    What's next for FlyOut - Go Prepared
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are hoping to incorporate more APIs to optimize our users' travel experiences. We hope to incorporate facebook authentication to retrieve mutual friends living in the area and grab public facebook events that are happening in the user's destination.
