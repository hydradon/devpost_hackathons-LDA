                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While homes have more and more smart-devices&mdash;thermostats, door locks, lights, and even appliances, but televisions and other displays have been relatively constant for years. Therefore, we wanted to create a new type of display with which multiple people can interact at one time from multiple angles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The HDMI projects a screen from a monitor on top into an acrylic pyramid which displays the projected image as a hologram that can be viewed from all four sides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We began by constructing the wooden frame which houses our holographic display. Next, we created our acrylic pyramid and placed it inside the wooden frame. After placing the monitor on top, we added some finishing touches and used our display to create holographic displays.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenges were with finding all of the materials we needed to construct the entire project. Additionally, we had a tough time figuring out how to create an audio visualizer for specific songs. Our team also did not have a programmer, so we had to learn Arduino in throughout the day in order to use it for our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The display works as we had hoped and the audio visualizer plays with the music, so our main goals were accomplished with the project!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is difficult to get a large project to work as intended as well as look aesthetically pleasing all in the course of one day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Holographic Display Music Interface (HDMI)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With more time, we hope to make the project more aesthetically pleasing&mdash;especially the outer wooden structure. Along with this, the sizing of the box could be reduced to create a more modern looking project.
