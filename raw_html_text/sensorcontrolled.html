                    AGAINST ARTICLE 13 AND INTERNET CENSORSHIP!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hello everyone!
we are the Team Sensor controlled.Our Idea was to provide a possibility for everyone to create their own multi-player games.
Those games are  controlled by various sensors over network.
-Just like our name implies-
                </p>
                <p>
                    You all know Article 13 was lately decided by the EU.
Since we didn't really understand how that thing was intended to work,
we implemented our own Interpretation of a upload filter as multiplayer game
                </p>
                <p>
                    Daniel will blow into an air sensor to contol the horizontal position the helicopter
Leonard over here will control the altitude of the helicopter with the tilt of his smartphone.
The other daniel will throw bombs with a keyhit
and i will fire and guide missiles with the mouse of my laptop
                </p>
                <p>
                    lets see if we can prevent all the
                    <em>
                        evil
                    </em>
                    memes to reach the net....
let's play together with sensors for a clean internet
