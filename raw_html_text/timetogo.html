                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People often forget their meeting time, or they did not think the traffic jam so they late at meeting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If user let the Alexa knows what time is the meeting and also place info. then it will tell you least what time user should be leave home for meeting based on Google Map's traffic API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We get the google map api, and built it on the Amazon skill kit with python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time ever to work on Amazon Development kit and A.I speaker. It took at least 6 hours to get used to Amazon development kit. Also, we had to look up on google on how we can upload codes on Alexa in order to test our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot on how real development goes. We didn't have any experiences in real life project by ourselves. First time planning was really tough, however once we started, it was fun. Also, We learned how to use Amazon development kit , and how real project should be done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TimeToGo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Current TimeToGo only work at Alexa app skill market, so we think to develop android app and ios app as well. Also, we will work for better user experiences.
