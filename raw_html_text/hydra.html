                    Inspiration - A lot people I know that travel often usually end up becoming ill.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does - The solution would be pumped from an exterior tank into the airplane passenger cabin, then there would be pipes along the skeleton of the plane that would spread the mist throughout the indoor space. The solution would end up drying after a certain period of time, then dissipate from airing our the cabin.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it - PVC pipes were used as the frame of the plane and hold our pipes. We used an Uno Arduino board with a motor to simulate the exterior tank pumping in the solution.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into - Figuring out the Uno Arduino board was most challenging and figuring out the circumstance of how to fully implement the material into the final mockup prototype.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of - Upon writing the code for the Uno Arduino, I had no previous experience with the hardware. This has opened many possible future projects for myself.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What I learned - I learned how to collaborate with people from similar and yet different perspectives. Every team possesses members with like-minds but that does not always guarantee that the vision will be the same.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hydra - Hopefully, in the future, there will be a much more beneficial chemical solution that poses less risk to passengers and more effective against colony forming units (CFUs).
