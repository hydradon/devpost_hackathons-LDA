                    The Challenge: Make on-campus communication more effective by increasing engagement and idea sharing between students. The College of Architecture's Diversity Council has called for us to "create places for people to share ideas, feelings, projects, and initiatives. Information overload among the 1000+ student organizations can be simplified to promote more effective collaboration. Enhance physical places with technology." Students lack a space that encourages engagement with fellow students. Further, many on-campus events have limited turnout because e-mail outreach is often neglected.
