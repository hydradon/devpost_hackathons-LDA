                    When we learned about the Developer Circles Community Challenged, we decided to participate by submitting a game. In the process of brainstorming ideas we all wanted to create something that would represent the culture of the state Nayarit, which is where we are from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By creating this game we would spread more awareness about the culture that exists in the state of Nayarit and that&rsquo;s how we came up with the idea of making our game based on the Wixaricas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned was a lot about the Wixarica culture since we did not know much about it ourselves, we started to study and investigate about them in order to create the game backgrounds, enemies, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also learned how to work as a team in order to create a videogame; this is our first game so we learned about what it takes to make one as a team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One big challenged we faced was the time, we knew about the challenge a bit late and had around only 2 to 3 weeks to develop the game but that didn&rsquo;t stop us.
