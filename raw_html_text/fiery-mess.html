                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspiration came from playing around with the VRTK-toolkit for Unity. After talking about different kind of ideas, we finally settled to this as it was one of the most intuitive ones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simulation of a fire breaking out and the player needing to do the initial fire-extinguishing and procedures, such as calling the emergency number.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity3D with C#. We used VRTK-toolkit as our VR-function base.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our team members hadn't used Unity before. Also, some of us were quite rusty with code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The result feels suprisingly good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we can perform as a team and that VR is suprisingly easy to develop for.
                </p>

                    What's next for Fiery mess
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Possibly fine-tuning, feature adding and seeking funding. (We don't have a vive of our own...)
