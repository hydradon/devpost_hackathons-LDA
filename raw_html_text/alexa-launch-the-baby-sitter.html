                <p>
                    Anyone with a toddler at home has felt the need for a helping hand at some point.
So sit back, relax and let the baby sitter do it's job.
The baby sitter skill for Amazon Alexa aims to educate and entertain toddlers, via engaging kid friendly content.
With the built in randomness, no two interactions with the babysitter will be identical, in an attempt to prevent boredom.
With the interactive stories, rhymes, counting game, color game and more, the babysitter strives to provide engaging content for toddlers.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Node.js and the Alexa SDK as the platform, I used behavior3.com's BehaviorTree Editor &amp; the Javascript BehaviorTree implementation, to easily manage conversations.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing text used in engaging conversations is one of the hardest part of building conversational bots.
BehaviorTrees (behavior3.com) provides a decent editor to handle text and state management that was leveraged to create the Baby Sitter.
