                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create a website to promote mental health awareness. There are many people in this world who are need to express their feelings but are afraid to do so because of the judgment they receive. The Dr. FeelGood website helps those going through struggles that affect mental health.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses machine learning to detect sentiment by the user and pushes quotes based upon their reaction. As a result of their reaction, the quotes are adjusted and displayed to the user so that they receive quotes according to their sentiment.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a recurrent neural network on the machine learning side, made an API for it by using Flask, and linked it to the Wix Editor.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to receive the output we desired and figuring our data set for our machine learning model. Wix Editor had limited capabilities so we couldn't call the input from the user within the coding environment Wix provided.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the first time coding in Jupyter, we were able to learn a lot about Machine Learning and built our first API using Flask which was a challenge but fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really learned that we liked Machine Learning. We learned some theories and went to the ML workshop provided. We also got more familiar with python and how to integrate it using Flask since we were trying to build the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Dr.FeelGood
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was more of a creative project we decided to do for the Hackathon, so most likely we probably will not work further on it. However, it really pushed us to understand the importance of Machine Learning in integrating it with software development.
