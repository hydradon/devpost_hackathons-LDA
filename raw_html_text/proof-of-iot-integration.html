                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of Decentralized event hub for IoT devices solution for seemless integration between thousands of IoT devices and cloud central and to Smart contract
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uploads a file (picture or video  or software applications) and stores in IPFS as a proof in later time
Which verify if the software is authentic or not and that mobile device IoT will stream to event hub
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built the smart contract using solidity and deployed in Rinkeby test net.
Login using decentralized identity system uport
decentralized and economical file store using IPFS
Front end is built using reactjs, nextjs, semantic-ui-react
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tryed to integration MESG service with IoT devices.but found error. Thats why I could not able to continue further.
But, even through this hackathon is complete, I will not stop the complete this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built end-to-end decentralized gas effective working model which uses solidity , Rineby , uport , IPFS. 
But, very happy that I made all attempt to learn about MESG service and its value .
Very happy that I will still continue to build by end to end .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A new system called deepcloudAI, MESG services
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Proof of IoT Integration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Extend this with coinbase wallet as well so that users can access and upload the images/software and get verified via they mobile device. Integration and develop MESG event hub and integrate it with cloud IoT and blockchain.
