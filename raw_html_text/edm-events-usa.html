                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to make a website for people want to see EDM Concert where people can book the tickets and get the notification about the new event will coming up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Website booking and searching for tickets. Used BOS business model and Eventbrite API.
When user signup BOS Server will send an authentication key to users email to verify it and save user in BOS service. After sign up, the user can start searching for an event they want to attend. 
I signed up domain edmeventsusa.com using domain.com # Thank for free domain

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was using Java and the Spring MVC Framework.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes when I used the app the document they provide was not enough. Example like a person typed field. It doesn't have any description about that field in the documentation, and I take me a lot of time to figure it out where the errors. 
API key sends to server or client should be encrypted in my point of view to be more secure.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using #BOS business API was a great chance to learn about a business model. I interested in using their API it makes business faster and quickly. We don't have to care about create a database or store the database about username password and information about the user. I hope I can have a chance to explore the API in the future!!

                    What's next for EDM Events USA
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With only me in the team I was unable to do much of work, I hope I can finish the project more entirely in the next year. I will add more functions to the website and trying to using Eventbrite API for search EDM event in the USA.
