                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were brainstorming about how children find education to be boring and focused on one aspect (parts of speech) that is taught in school but not always retained in the minds of children. A friend mentioned Madlibz and Ryan from MLH came by and asked if we were making it so that multiple could contribute at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows players to learn the different parts of speech and make a story through Madlibz! Players text a number and are added the the game. Afterwards, they are sent various parts of speech (ex. Enter a noun or enter a verb). Players send back a part of speech (ex. for a noun - Dog) and keep going until all the blanks are filled in. At the end, all the players get sent the final story!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were advised to utilize Node.js and JavaScript. We decided that using the Twilio API would be the most beneficial for what we were trying to do.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time implementing the turn-based system into our game.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Twilio API and Node.js. We also successfully finished our game!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to collaborate with others and all about APIs.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will try to add more stories and add larger groups of players. Implement a system that checks if what the user enters is the correct part of speech.
