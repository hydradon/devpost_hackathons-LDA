                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Live Meeters and Eaters was inspired by wanting to create a community where users interested in a specific cuisine or culture could come together and experience that cuisine or culture
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users visit the site and are able to sign up or login. Once authenticated, they will see a map of there area with a lot of pins representing many different restaurants available to be booked for an outing. Clicking on a "pin" will display more information about that restaurant. Users can request to meet there, and with each reservation, the capacity of the restaurant will fill up.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LME was built with go, html, css, bootstrap, and javascript. We're also using the zomato, pusher, and google maps api
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to build the app using python and django, and did build it with that stack for a large majority of the hackathon. However, we found that the app became bloated and not very useful
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all proud in our ability to get the app working in the short time we had during the switch from Python to GO
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about Google Cloud api's, Azure, Go, and Javascript
                </p>
