                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make mental health improvement services accessible to everyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives resources to those who seek mental assistance for free in an easy to use manner. Also this application allows the user to document their mental health that can be shared and used by mental health professionals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the prototype on a pc application called "JustInMind", and a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges we ran into was properly learning how to use a VCS. Coding as a team seemed to be a continuous stumbling block.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first thing we are very proud of is team development. The next thing is that we are proud of becoming familiar with android studio and its functionality. We are not going to commercialize the product to align with out mission. Instead, we will focus on achieving non-profit status.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Version control is very important. Learn an app engine before you decide to create with it. Also, we leaned to work with individuals with diverse educational backgrounds. We learned and found information to support our vision to provide access to mental health care in El Paso.

                </h2>
                <p>
