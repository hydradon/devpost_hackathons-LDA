                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Career fairs are hectic when so many students try to talk to recruiters at once. Recruiters don&rsquo;t have time to scan everyone&rsquo;s paper resume at the fair, and it is even harder to remember their faces after they drop off their paper resume. We decided to make an app that associates a student&rsquo;s face to his/her resume using facial recognition software. Recruiters can look at a student&rsquo;s resume quickly at a career fair and remember the student&rsquo;s face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HYRE is a web application created to aid both students and recruiters in the job hiring process. Students use the app to upload their resumes and pictures. Recruiters use the app by taking a picture of a student at career fair and immediately obtaining his/her resume through facial recognition software. Recruiters can save students they like in the app if recruiters are considering students for hire. HYRE can not only be used at career fairs, but also at networking events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HYRE was built using Django, Python, HTML, Javascript, and a SQLite database for the web application. The facial recognition software API was obtained from Kairos, an open source human analytics platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Staying awake. Especially after promising ourselves no caffeine. Also, implementing facial recognition reliably and integrating it into our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making a complete product that we can demo at career fair.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Django and how to create web applications (none of us had prior experience).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HYRE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can significantly improve our facial recognition algorithm by using a more well-known API (which would take longer to implement). In addition, the app could be much more interactive for students, where students could view companies and save recruiters that they met, so that the students don&rsquo;t forget recruiters&rsquo; names and faces. This would also be a cool project for Microsoft HoloLens, since recruiters could pull up resumes as holograms.
