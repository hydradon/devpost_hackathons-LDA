                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Collaboration tool is an essential tool for better team work, management and communication. We recognise the importance of increasing productivity among team members and hence were inspired to choose this project.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our collaboration provides easiness of communication, information searching and sentimental analysis of meeting.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python as the based programming language to develop this tool. We had also utilised various other APIs and libraries such as Twilio, NLTK, DuckDuckGo, thesaurus, cisco-webex, google news and docker. We first analysed the application and came up with goals to accomplish within the limited timeframe. We then delegated the task accordingly to each members. We helped each other out along the way and manage to complete most of our set goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges we encountered was the installation and utilisation of docker as many of us lack the experience and required tool to install them. With the assistance of several mentors and support from one another, we managed to complete it but it took away a significant amount of time. However, through resilience and passion, we pushed through and overcame the challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The accomplishment we were proud of was us successfully implementing various functionalities especially dockers which we were completely foreign to. Nonetheless, we managed to adapt and successfully implemented it.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had learned the importance of teamwork and communication when taking on a project as a team as we managed to complete this project all due to the fact that we consistently assisted each other.
                </p>

                    What's next for Team Assistant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enhancement of sentimental analysis with subjectivity scores. More tightly coupled with the search engine APIs to produce more personalised search results.
