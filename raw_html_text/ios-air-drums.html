                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Drums are expensive and this prevents a lot of people who can't afford them from enjoying this cheerful past time. We want to make drumming accessible to anyone and anywhere.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the use of iWatches, users can open this app on their phone and select various types of drumming sets to play music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized gyroscopes and accelerometers on an iwatch to collect hand motion data. We used blue-tooth to transfer data from the iwatch to an iphone. Based on the data, we calculated different types of hand gesture and assigned specific sound to each of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled with accurately producing a beat sound when the user would strike downwards, We had trouble with the iwatch os 2 since it was just released. Also, we had to do extensive research in order to be able to use the iwatch's gyroscopes and accelerometers. Finally, it was a  difficulty process to come up with a precise algorithm to curate our data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the impossible task of implementing an app, especially utilizing an iWatch with little documentation and no knowledge of swift before this weekend.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The crucial component every team member plays in development, and how difficult yet rewarding it can be.
