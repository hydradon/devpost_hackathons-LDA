                    When I was thinking of problems to solve I remembered one that comes up often: my girlfriend and I often spend large amounts of time trying to find a movie to watch. I wanted to find a unique way to help us narrow down our choices and then I thought about Spotify and how they create playlists based on moods and thought I could try something similar.

                    I'm not really much of a back-end person so this project definitely gave me an appreciation for it. I found an API from The Movie Database that was well documented and used it as my movie database. I matched movie genres to moods so when a user clicked on a mood it would populate a list with movies of that genre. While TMDB's API is relatively easy to use I still had trouble connecting my JavaScript to my front-end so it would work the way I wanted. I was able to figure it out though!
