                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we are all college students we know how hard it is to find jobs. We figured that people who were in the military should be able to find jobs easily.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This resource helps military personnel focus on a particular agency based on their answers to survey questions.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used mySQL as a database to store resource information, and we used C# as well as HTML &amp; CSS to develop the front end of our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SQL connections often had connectivity issues. Figuring out how to connect our resources and front end appropriately was a challenge for all involved. Fatigue was also an issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were proud of having a demo for the judges given our different backgrounds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that given the different backgrounds and skill sets of all individuals involved, a final product can be reached once the common thread is found and developed on.
                </p>

                    What's next for VetLink
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand this web application to a mobile application as well as develop more questionnaire sections for finding different agencies.
