                    I was inspired by the Google text adventure easter egg where when you search "text adventure" and go into the console, there's a text adventure. It was fun, so I thought I'd do something like that.

                    It's a game. The story is when you were playing games when you weren't supposed to in school, and your teachers punish you bu putting YOU inside the game.

                    I used Jetbrains Intellij IDEA, which is a java IDE.

                    It was my first time coding in a very long time. I've done a little Java before, but it was very long ago. Also this was my first Hackathon, so I didn't really know

                    It's around 150 lines of code; the longest project in my whole life. I don't remember the last time I've ever sat down and did this much code in such a short amount of time. My fingers are dead!

                    I learned how to make a text adventure! It was extremely fun, especially how it was actual code, not some kind of game engine. I learned how to use the scanner from our mentors, who was really helpful and nice.

                    Hopefully I can use methods and other things to effectively reduce the amount of time and code that went into this, while increasing the gameplay. This took over 3 hours to make, yet takes less than 5 minutes to finish the game.
