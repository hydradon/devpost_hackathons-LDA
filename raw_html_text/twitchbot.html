                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by the Curiosity rovers ability to keep going for 10+ years
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RideWithTwitch is the end result of several ideas we came up with over the weekend mixed up. The primary goal of our project is that we used the twitch interface to control the movement of a motorized robot in a forward, left, and right motion. Which in theory is simple, but in reality, well, is not. Secondly, as bit of a last minute feature we decided we'd like to hook up one of our phones to the robot, and film it's journey and relay it back to the twitch live stream.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using
                    <strong>
                        Twitch.tv
                    </strong>
                    ,
                    <strong>
                        Arduino Boards and Arduino Language
                    </strong>
                    , and
                    <strong>
                        python
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into several unexpected issues. First we ran into several problems with the arduino boards compatibility, and the personalized arduino langues. In an attempt to make the project as cheap as possible we bought them in mass and ended up getting a faulty arduino board and it took a while to find the problem. The biggest issue, however, was soldering and setup of the arduino boards. This was very time consuming, and we accidentally made a couple of mistakes with wiring and soldering. Another challenge was learning how to effectively use the nano boards to get the output we wanted, and ended up spending a lot of time sifting through header files to learn new information.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that we were able to take take an exciting software idea (twitch stream), and apply it in a unique way to run a robot.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team we learned to communicate as much as possible, and to let each other do what we're best at in peace.

                    What's next for TwitchBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RideWithTwitch ideally will sometime in the future have four wheels and be able to have complete control of its motion.
