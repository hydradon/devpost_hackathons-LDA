                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We read the description of the Accenture GREEN Hack and we got inspired to do this idea!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It sees if an item has been added to the bin and, when it does, it looks at the item and determines if it's a recyclable item (we only had the time to train the model to recognize a juice box) or something else.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With OpenCV we can get access to the webcam of the computer and every x number of frames, we analyse the frame to detect if there's an object. If it does, we send the frame to the model for prediction.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dependencies....

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud to have used Tensorflow and made it work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use OpenCV and Tensorflow
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SmartBin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we could go further and make the model recognize more recycable objects
                </p>
