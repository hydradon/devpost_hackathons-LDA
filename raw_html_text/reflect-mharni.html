                    Bipolar disorder, also referred to as manic-depressive illness, is a brain disorder which causes unusual shifts in mood and energy. The primary indication of this disorder is regular and constant swings in one&rsquo;s mood and energy level.
The primary motivation for this application is to provide medical professionals with data which allows them to better differentiate bipolar disorder from major depression. Those who suffer from bipolar disorder are more likely to seek medical help when they are experiencing depressive episodes compared to manic episodes, and thus many physicians are unable to properly differentiate the two disorders. This is dangerous as the treatment methods for these two disorders are drastically different: bipolar disorder is treated with mood-stabilizing drugs, whereas depression is treated by upregulating dopamine, which can aggravate manic episodes in those suffering from bipolar disorder.
In major depressive disorder, patients suffering from major depression may experience brief and irregular periods of mania, but are not as regular as in bipolar disorder.
By monitoring daily mood and emotions, and tracking changes over long periods of time in between consultations with doctors, this application will provide physicians with crucial information for proper diagnosis and treatment of these two radically different mental disorders.

                    Clinical research needs to be done in order to set thresholds for classifying episodes, as well as interpretation of frequency and duration of episodes. This app&rsquo;s primary motive is to provide physician with the necessary data to properly diagnose mental disorders, not make diagnoses ourselves.

                    Reflect utilizes facial and voice emotion recognition to track the emotions of the user over long periods of time. Through careful analysis of fluctuations in mood, physicians can better diagnose mental disorders such as bipolar disorder which require long periods of monitoring.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built the app in Android Studio using Java. We used Firebase as our backend

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    API gave us a hard time with the application since it was outdated.

                <p>
                    Proud of getting some of the API's to work with our application

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned to work as a team to accomplish making this app. Also learned how to my apply classroom knowledge of java into an actual app. It was a good experience working on an android app. Learned how difficult the process is from coming up with an idea for a project to actually coding and getting the app to work: learned how to better prepare for future Hackathons such we can make more progress.

                    To connect the user directly to a clinician and have a more accurate representation of what is deemed as depression vs any bipolar disorder.
