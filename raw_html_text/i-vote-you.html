                    <li>
                        Users create unique secret as

                    <li>

                        After the end of voting counters MapReduce all messages from last to first via snarks without publishing any subtotals. If the secret is new, we increment subtotal vector and add the secret to set of known secrets during the counting (how to do it is described

                <p>
                    And now on the blockchain it seems there are no normal votes, i.e. in classical implementations, it is done in such a way that the votes are visible before the voting is closed. That there is a serious violation of the privacy and the latter can greatly influence the outcome of the vote.
