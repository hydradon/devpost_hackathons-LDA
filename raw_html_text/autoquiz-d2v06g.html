                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students today suffer from poor study habits due to time constraints. We live in an era where everyone benefits from different learning styles, where auditory-oriented students are struggling to find options in ways to study. Whether you&rsquo;re commuting on the crowded subway or traveling through Central Park, you will find this app makes the most efficient use of your time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To address occupied college students, we introduce an improved, autonomous mobile app that takes a simple URL input and parses the information to create a personal quiz. It is a flexible, integrated voice recognition app that prompts the user for a pre-programmed or customized quiz on a certain subject.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studios and java to build AutoQuiz. We first started by building the backend algorithms like scraping quizlet to find the questions and answers for our quizzes. After that, we worked on the graphics and front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scraping the website through the app. We made the scraper for a personal computer however we noticed that it wont work on the android app. We had a big setback however we were able to overcome the problem after hours of research and learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ability to use custom quizzes from quizlet by entering a URL and automatically scraping the website through the mobile platform Android Studios.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating android apps. Making android apps opened a lot of opportunities for us
Using Android Studio to explore a new world of app development, opening a new world of opportunities
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AutoQuiz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing and improving more functions such as UI and the application database. We aim to make the app more aesthetically pleasing and to create an overall reactive user interface. In time, we plan to implement machine learning to taylor quizzes to the user&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. Lastly, we wish to expand to more websites other than Quizlet to diversify user learning.
