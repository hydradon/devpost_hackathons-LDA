                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a phrase entered by the user, and replaces all text nodes in  containing that string with randomized images. The theme of the images can be changed within the settings. The extension is published on  Web Store and users can easily install it with inline installation from our .tech website hosted on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we focused on making the popup page, and getting each of the modes to alter the popup's style. Then we started working on the actual scripts for the extension. You know, the stuff that actually does something. After trying multiple methods, we finally found one that allowed us to find both the phrase within the webpage and to grab the font size of the original string before replacing it.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So, so many. Trying to get the scripts to communicate with the webpage. Inserting div node within text node without breaking the structure or introducing potential security vulnerabilities.

                <p>
                    We could allow users to create their own themes for the extension, and share those themes online.
