                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ReadyNYC launched a preparedness billboard campaign. It got me thinking, but has been too inconvenient to tackle the planning process with my family. There had to be an easier way.

                <p>
                    Goes to where the user is, communicates over the channel and at the pace the user wants to use. Collects specifics and provides bite-size, habit forming steps and highly relevant information to help users plan.

                    Interviews with 14 mentors, and many participants.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Big respect for our national guard and emergency responders. Very big challenges.
Small steps can lead to big outcomes, especially in communications and planning.
User adoption is a key challenge. How do we design cues around news, events to drive adoption?
