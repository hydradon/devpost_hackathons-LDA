                    Nowadays exchanging social media is something that habitually occurs when meeting and interacting with new people. However, with the growing amount of platforms that the world chooses to be active on, it can sometimes get irritating and can even become inconvenient when trying to connect.

                <p>
                    That's where Connections comes in. Our web-app allows you to automatically connect with your acquaintances by sharing just a single username. After exchanging, our program runs through the different social media that each user has and connects the two on all platforms.

                    Our team faced a lot of tough challenges while developing this idea into a functioning app. This is mainly due to the lack of experience as this is the very first 'hacking event' that any member has participated in.

                    Our young team stems from the various disciplines of the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Alberta, including Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering along with 2 Computer/Software engineers.

                    Due to our novice levels of programming, we had to explore a lot of uncharted territories whether that may be learning a completely new language or using a known language to do something we never knew we could.
