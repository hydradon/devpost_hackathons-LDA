                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It sucks when you are running at full speed trying to catch your bus, only to miss it because the driver didn't see you. Well never fear, for Bus Ping is here!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bus Ping provides you with a means to ping a bus when you are within range. This alerts the driver and will save you from waiting outside in the cold. We have included a mobile payment system that allows you to pay for your fare with your phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have three different iterations of Bus Ping. A desktop application built using C# in Visual Studio, a website built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and a mobile application built using Java in Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had any experience developing similar applications. This required us to learn many new languages, features, and skills on the fly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to complete our projects despite the short time and lack of experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learn environments and languages that we wish to use
                    <strong>
                        before
                    </strong>
                    the event rather than during the event. As well, we all gained valuable experience through experimenting with various environments.
                </p>
