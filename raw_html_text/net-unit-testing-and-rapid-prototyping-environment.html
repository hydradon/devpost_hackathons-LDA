                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During my internship this past Summer I found myself increasingly frustrated when attempting to make method calls and use code developed by my peers. This led to the idea of a rapid prototyping/debugging environment with simple drag and drop and clicking to link them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Grants the user access to internal method information to allow the user to create a Unit Test/ simple verification quickly and without the need of compilation or writing of code!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using System.Reflection and System.Linq it systematically probes .DLL files and pulls necessary function information for verifying that methods are called properly and with the correct parameters as specified by the user. This wraps all functions and calls made to allow simple feedback for the user to aid in potential fixes for debugging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Windows forms.... Unluckily my designer window for VS isn't working as well which pushed my UI skills to develop a lightweight and scalable UX!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The UX is simple to pick up and has a wide variety of backend versatility for future implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Remembered a lot of stuff from my internship such as System.Linq as well as learned new information about what is stored in a compiled library .dll file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for .NET Unit Testing and Rapid Prototyping Environment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further functionality and a cleaner non-hacked UX!
