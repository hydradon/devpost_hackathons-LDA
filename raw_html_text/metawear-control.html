                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was thinking of a way to bring easy access to all of our electronic devices, as well as providing a new and simpler interface for more primitive electronics, such as a lamp or a ceiling fan. I came to realize that the simplest way to interact with these electronics would be by detecting the movement of a finger and doing an action depending on what kind of movement was done, that is how the idea of a motion controller in a ring was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ring is design to control every single electronic device a person owns. Because of time constraints, for now it only works with an LED and a servo motor. When tapping once with your finger on any surface the LED will turn on and off, and when double tapping the servo motor will turn on and off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made an android app that communicates with the sensor ring via Bluetooth, once a communication path is established, the app makes a Bluetooth link with the micro that controls the LED and the servo motor. It is a three-way communication with the phone as the master and the ring and the micro as slaves: from the ring to the phone, and from the phone to the micro. Once the command gets to the micro, the Arduino app I did takes care of reading the states of the LED and the servo and acting accordingly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The API for the sensor I am using does not have a well explained documentation, so I had to do an intense research that took a lot of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mere fact that the ring works makes me very proud, but if we are talking about things I am proud of as I was developing, I can say I am very proud of finding solutions to the problems I encountered: The things the sensor's documentation did not explain, I found by myself by reading the definition of every class in the docs. It was very time consuming, but in the end it was worth it because I have a working prototype of a great idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the technical part I can say I learned more about the sensor's API and how to establish a Bluetooth connection between a master and several slaves on the Android platform, but in a more personal way, I can say I learned to keep pushing forward until I make it. During the developing part, I encountered so many different problems that I started to see if I could work on something else, because I felt I was not going to find a solution, but I stuck to this and went through everything until I found a way to make it work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Metawear Control
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next thing is to add more devices to control, as well as using the accelerometer not only for tap detection as I have done for this hack, but also use it to measure tilt detection and so be able to have another way of input: tilt detection can work as a dimmer for a ceiling light. The board I am using for this hack has many integrated sensors that could come in handy when it comes to designing ideas to control electronics. The possibilities are endless!
