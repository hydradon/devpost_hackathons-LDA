                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help people in need. Those affected by Hurricane Urma and Harvey was been gravely affected. We wanted to help prepare and guide them when natural disasters may arise.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Displays information about before, during, and after natural disasters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used MS Frontpage and integrated CSS into it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a sub-list was difficult since it wasn't indenting and if it did, it didn't display the bullet points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this is our first hackathon, we are proud to have developed a website that could potentially help save lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to fix glitches and manage our time. We also learned new programming skills that we need to further develop before going to our next hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Survival Aid
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More types of natural disasters could be added. A form could take the user's input and warn her of any upcoming disasters (if it's in a danger zone) and display the nearest first responder's contact information.
