                    What is arbitrage?
"the simultaneous buying and selling of securities, currency, or commodities in different markets or in derivative forms in order to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset."
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of bitcoin, arbitrage is taking advantage of the different cost for 1 BTC between two different exchanges. These differences can net small margins if they are greater than the fees from transfering between exchanges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of the project is to notify users about bitcoin arbitrage opportunities based on exchanges they are watching. It accounts for the buy/sell fees for each available exchange, and assumes the user has significant equity in both BTC and USD on the exchanges they plan to execute an arbitrage.
