                    Lazy housemates.

                    Provides evidence to call them out on said laziness.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Badly, with NFC tags, laravel, and a failure of an Android app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lack of experience in the technologies being used, and the overwhelming desire to sleep.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half of the team being responsible enough to sleep for some hours, and the other half being irresponsible enough to not sleep at all.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NFC in Android is not nearly as streamlined as expected.
It's really hard to care about something for 24 hours straight.
HTML marquees are still the pinnacle of great web design.
