                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to manipulate the code for the NASA Swarmathon Competition and get it to work and collect resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are three rovers who attempt to collect resources but fail at doing so
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using the base code provided by the UNM github page (which is what will be submitted)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not know ROS. We could not fully understand the limitations of the project and ourselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I attempted a very difficult project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I need to learn things before jumping into them. Maybe baby steps?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Failed Mars Landing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing. I believe the project ends here, unfortunately.
                </p>
