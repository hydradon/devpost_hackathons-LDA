                    Teens and growing adults have to deal with a lot of emotional changes and its somewhat a taboo to talk about your emotional health. Consequences of mental health problems can include poor performance in school or at work, lack of established friendships and much-needed social interactions, substance or alcohol abuse, risky sexual behavior leading to infectious diseases, and suicide. In fact being the second/third leading cause of death among persons ages 10 to 24 according to the CDC, in which 90% of the population had a mental disorder at the time of suicide. We wanted to make it easier for young people to seek advice and we aim to diagnose their disorder and connect them with a nearby psychologist or expert in the area.
