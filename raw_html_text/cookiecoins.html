                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm using my running to help save kids' lives by fundraising for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as I train. I'm running for kids who might be too sick to run today, but who could one day be running alongside me because the money I raised helped find a cure for childhood cancer.
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food -- because all a family should worry about is helping their child live.
Treatments invented at St. Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20% to more than 80% since it opened more than 50 years ago. St. Jude won't stop until no child dies from cancer.
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    Please donate and help me reach my goal, and beyond--TO THE MOON!
