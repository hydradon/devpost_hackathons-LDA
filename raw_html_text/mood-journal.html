                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was a desire to create an app that facilitates mental well-being by allowing you to keep a log of your moods over time, and see what patterns emerge from these logs. We also created a gradient pinwheel fro daily view to allow a visualization of moods.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows the user to add entries to today's date, where they select any moods they are feeling from a list of moods, along with any notes. Each mood is correlated with a color, and these combine over the day to create a pinwheel gradient of colors to represent overall moods during the day. There is also a calendar function so that it is easy to view any entries from any date easily.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by using the React JS framework, which made it easy to build an interactive website. We split our design into several different components to be implemented, along with a design implementation of how to put all these components together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into difficulties specifically regarding react and data transfer within React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of how quickly we were able to create a mostly-functional website, and how much we were able to learn about React and the different components of a website. Most of us had limited knowledge of React, so the fact that we were able to create the product we did after 36 hours is very cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We mostly learned about different components to building a website (front-end, back-end), data transfer, state management, and other important aspects of building and maintaining a web app.
