                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was never easy for the event coordinators to run raffles and make sure the winner gets the prize! It is also disappointing to have to leave without a way to know if you've won!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Anyone who uses the app can create a raffle for an event that they are organizing! By having other people sign into the app and entering their ticket number (either through manual input or OCR), the organizer can then pull the winning ticket and automate a text message to the winner with details on how to claim the prize!! Not only can this be used for your small ice cream raffles and other shenanigans, but if you wanted to help out a community for the powerball, you can use Waffle!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built on node.js. Originally, we worked on parallel to build a native Android app as well as a web app. The Android app is currently not fully functional, however, our web app is ready to go! We used the Twilio API's to notify the winner and BootStrap to style the web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    OCR and RESTFUL API calls between our backend and Android created problems for querying. OCR was particularly difficult due to slow responses.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works and can be used as a tool!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ambition is good, but too much will overwhelm you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Waffle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More stable routing and error handling. Abuse prevention and cross-platform functionality. Integration with Powerball API's and other famous lotteries.
