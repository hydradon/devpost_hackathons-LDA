                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my 2019 New Year's resolutions was the learn Chinese.  It has been something I have wanted to learn for a long time but just never put in the effort to learn the language.  Now I would be lying if I said that throughout this year I have been consistent with learning the new language but I have stumbled plenty on making it a daily habit. Currently I have been using Duolingo and Rosetta Stone to learn the language but I needed some more motivation.  So I built this Language Learning API.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Language Learning API is an API to create games to help learn new languages.  Right now it includes learning Chinese for English speakers by utilizing some of the words/phrases that are included in the

                    .  This could be a multiple choice trivia game, memory card game, or just

                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses Azure Text to Speech API to create audio recordings for different Chinese words/phrases along with their meanings in English.  Both recordings utilize the "Neural Text to Speech" to give the recordings a natural feel.  The service also uses Azure Text Analytics API to categorize the words/phrases so that games can create themes for different questions such as numbers, family members, etc.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I still have not completely figured out the categorization issue.  I think I might need to build on top of the Azure Text Analytics API with manual tags to create my own machine learning model.

                <p>
                    Since starting with this project I have been far more consistent with learning Chinese.  Part of that has to do with me wanting to create new games and the other part is playing existing games so I can "borrow" features for future games I make.

                <p>
                    Go see the Great Wall of China of course (there is a reason I am learning the language). Plus figure out the categorization issue and build more games.  Some of these games I will likely just keep for myself but others I will publish so that more people can practice Chinese who want to.  I also tried to abstract the API I built so that I can add more languages like Italian, Spanish, French, etc.
