                    The Affliction:
This past weekend our team came into CUNYHackathon with an affliction: most of us were inexperienced in coding. After a few seminars and some heavy mentor help this weekend we are much better versed in things like Node-RED, BlueMix and Twilio but what if this Hackathon were like our normal school routine? We probably wouldn't have such a crazy big deadline to complete as creating the companies that we've built in the past 72 hours, but we also probably wouldn't have the caliber of mentors that we've had at Hackathon. How do normal students study for tests today? We carry around textbooks and dedicate hours due diligence, right? Not anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Solution:
Addie is the brainchild of a group of textbook procrastinators who hate the doldrum task of traditional textbook learning. How great would it be if for the week leading up to that Western Civ exam you received SMS messages to your phone that would jog your memory for each question you'll have to answer. This is what we call "socially active learning". Our brains are like swimming pools below funnels, if you slowly release water into that funnel one cup at a time the pool below will fill completely, but if you unleash Niagra Falls onto the same funnel at once there will be so much over flow that the pool will not fully fill. The same thing goes for those of us who cram for tests: we'll never be able to memorize everything and when the midterm comes around we definitely haven't retained any of that "crammage". In the same way, Addie makes it possible to study for little insignificant spurts of time over a longer timeframe.
