                    We all love clothes, and buying new clothes is especially addictive! It's true, feeling like your best self is important, but it's also important to help our planet. Just to make a single shirt, it takes about 700 gallons of water! There's nothing wrong with buying clothes, but adopting the right habits will certainly help the environment! This is where our app comes in: we encourage retaining clothes for at least 3 years(in contrast to the average of 1 year) to help save some water for the planet! This app is easy to use and informs the user about his or her water footprint.

                    We also intended to provide a page(globe button) which allows a user to input a certain article of clothing from a website such as amazon, and receive information about the amount of water in gallons that went into producing the item. Further, the app would determine how long an individual must retain the clothing in order to save water.
