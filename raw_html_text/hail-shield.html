                <p>
                    Portable protective cover for General Aviation wings, fuselage, and empennage against hail damage.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    two layers of material with a sealed internal baffles inflated with air individually from a common point.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting an airtight chambers, filling the chambers from a common source.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Printing internal structure of an aircraft wing, using a low tech solution to reduce cost and the technology is already available to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Weather has a large negative cost associated with aircraft ownership the pilots need the ability to protected the aircraft when it is sitting in the weather.

                    What's next for Hail Shield
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a better material such a sheet rubber that has the ability to form chambers and hold air, also creating a working prototype with to verify hail damage protection. Also, we need to find a material that makes the hail shield portable and lightweight.
