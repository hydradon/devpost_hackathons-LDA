                    This is an application that uses the

                    to see how far you need to run in order to "work off" certain foods. It supports generic names and UPC codes.

                    Why is this important?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obesity is a large problem in the United States and many sources point to portion control as a reason why. The goal of this app is to help users visualize what they're eating, and how long they need to run in order to work that off. People are more likely to eat less or set a realistic goal if they know just what they're eating is worth in working out.

                    How to use
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make a file with the following inside of src/
                </p>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>export default{
                key: "MY_API_KEY"
}
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    MY_API_KEY is your API key for UDSA's database
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then run the following
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        npm start
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And then have at it.
