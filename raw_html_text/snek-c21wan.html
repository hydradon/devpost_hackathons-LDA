                    <em>
                        "JavaScript was written in ten days, I'll write sNEK in two."

                <p>
                    I wrote sNEK in a matter of around twelve hours to see how much complexity/features I can put into a language in short a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Seeing that my biggest obstacles in my past PL projects was grammar, I decided that the quickest was to overcome it was by implmenting S-expressions. The rest of the lanuage kind of just
                    <em>
                        popped
                    </em>
                    in after that.

                    Features
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <em>
                        "I just gotta finish this so it looks I actually did something for SD Hacks"

                    sNEK combines allows for both imperative and functional programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In sNEK, one can declare a a variable scope with multiple variables and multiple statements to execute within that scope. The same goes for while-loops which can also house a sequential list of statements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A major feature of sNEK is its static-type checking as all variables and functions must list their respective types.

                <p>
                    sNEK is written in Java 1.8 and depends on a modified version of Grammatica 1.6 for its grammar and parsing.
