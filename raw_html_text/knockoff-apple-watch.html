                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have an iPhone but not an apple watch
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Works with bluetooth (bluefruit) and Flora NeoPixels to signal when a text, email, Instagram, etc. is received
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Worked with Unhackathon team to get an understanding of Adafruit programming.  Haven't built it yet as we did not have all the wires but want to sew a 1" TFT screen to stretch fabric with bluefruit and neopixels attached with steel thread.  Bluefruit will connect to my personal iPhone (haha...android marries IOS).  When an email is received, neopixel will turn blue.  When a text is received, neopixel will turn green.  When a call comes in, neopixels will flash quickly between red, blue, and green.  When an Instagram message is received a white light will flash on neopixel.

                    I have an understanding of Flora and Adafruit and look forward to learning more.
