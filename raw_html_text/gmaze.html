                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration of this game came from some fun puzzle games we played like Portal2 and Talos Principle. We thought puzzle games were cool so we decided to make a puzzle game. Something that we thought could make games like Portal 2 better is a competitive aspect. We thought it would be cool to make something multiplayer where you fight each other instead of working together like in Co Op portal for example.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a 2 player game where you design a maze for your opponent to solve and vice versa. Whoever solves each others maze first wins. What makes this game cool is that it involves 2 aspects - designing a hard maze and solving your opponents maze quickly. Unfortunately since we could not set up a server for multiplayer (because we're at a hackathon), this is more of a "proof of concept game". You solve the mazes by using gravity. You can only move in one direction until you hit a block or "fall" (die) off the edge of the screen. To make sure that a player cannot make an impossible maze, you must win your maze for your opponent to play it.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using a IDE Netbeans with JavaFX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges, most of them being simple bugs that kept messing our program up. The hardest part was solving using 2 players at the same time. This took a lot of work and all 4 of us to keep on this problem until it was solved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are extremely proud of the hard work we put in. This project is over 3 thousand lines of code which took a lot of concentrated energy to complete. The sheer size of this program is incredible and doing multiplayer was extremely taxing and infuriating, but also extremely rewarding in the end. We are especially amazed that this was managed to be pulled off as coming up with the idea and programming 3000+ lines in a day was really  difficult to pull off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about java FX which most of us agree is better than Swing. This was also a great learning experience in Java for us all because we all now know a lot more about Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GMaze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for Gmaze is to add being able to play online (you can't set up a server at a hackathon), better graphics/cleaning the ui up a little bit, and sound effects. We could also improve on our extremely limited single player mode (although the game was meant to be multiplayer). We also at sometime would like to
