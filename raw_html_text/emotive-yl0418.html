                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team wanted to simplify the process of movie choice for everyone, starting from a huge movie fan to not a movie person. We understood that nowadays movies aren't categorized very well, as movie genres don't give an accurate picture of the plot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried to split movies by emotions which they induce.
We decided to make search by the most common emotions, which we analyzed by parsing IMDB reviews.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started from research and collecting data about different movies. As one of the most popular source we have chosen Imdb.com. Using python libs we have aggregated data from top movies.
Then we trained SVM machine-learning algorithm with bag of words presentation data.
Also we have tried to focus on user experience, so we built a web application with material design pattern.
