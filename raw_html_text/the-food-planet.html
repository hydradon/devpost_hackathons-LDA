                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are inspired by all the food instagrammers and Clarifai's API to make this happen (it's really like to eat but we are broke af so...)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Put in the photo URL and this website will tell you what ingredients there are (thank you Clarifai) and it will generate recipes for you (Yay Spoonacular!).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many hours of fretting over the difference between JSON and JSONP + hosting on Amazon, we still haven't quite figure it out but...
Decided to use bootstraps standard templates and perform some jQuery magic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    See above.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding really good pictures of kolache.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we must learn what APIs do and how to actually use it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Food Planet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bringing it to mobile as an App, find the prices of food based on your locations/favorite grocery stores so that we can tell you how much it cost on average to recreate it, how much time it takes to make it and you decide if you want to make it :P
