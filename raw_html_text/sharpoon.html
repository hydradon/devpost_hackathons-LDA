                    Made by a group with very limited coding experience, and absolutely zero Unity experience, Sharpoon was made purely from determination and creativity.

                    The player goes through a variety of levels in which they must use their harpoon to maneuver through obstacles to get to the other side.

                    With our limited knowledge, we had to use creativity to solve problems that may be simple to someone experienced with Unity, but since we had no experience with the program, we looked up guides and found different ways to solve the problems we faced along the way.  The art was made by one member, the story by another, and the majority of the coding in Unity was done by the remaining two.

                    With little to no knowledge in a program like Unity, we ran into many problems. Even simple things like having our character jump seemed to represent a huge challenge, but with Youtube videos and problem solving mechanics, as well as working as a team, we were able to overcome most of the blockades we faced.

                    We are extremely proud of what we were able to produce during this 24 hour period. This event was definitely a learning experience. We learned new things about Unity, as we had no prior experience with it, and learned new creative ways to keep the player interested and having fun.

                    It's not so much about your experience in a certain program, but rather how determined you are to overcome those challenges.

                    We are very interested in improving our planning abilities so we feel more comfortable during the construction phase of our project. We found that we spent more time worrying about detailed textures than making sure our game was fully functional, so we definitely want to improve on that for the future.
