                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As TJ students, we frequently go to a nearby plaza to buy food. It's a common occasion that someone doesn't have enough money and borrows some from a friend. We wanted to make an app that could track how much to pay back to each person and provide an easy way to transfer the money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When given an input of the amount of money each person needed to pay and the how much they actually ended up paying, our app is able to calculate how much money is owed from one person to another. It then stores this data so that people can keep track of how much they owe or are owed. Furthermore, it implements Capitol One API to allow transfers of money using Capital One accounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Swift, implemented methods that began in Java, utilized the Capitol One API, and built front end design with XCode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had limited experience with IOS development and had trouble understanding the Capitol One API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a functional app that successfully implemented the Capitol One API through the swift language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to build mobile apps, program in Swift, how to better read APIs, and lastly learned the challenges of creating an app.
