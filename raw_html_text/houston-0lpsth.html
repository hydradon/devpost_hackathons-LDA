                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created Houston because as a future entrepreneurs we've personally struggled with finding good problems to solve. We keep hearing that you need to solve a problem that you yourself have but frankly after thinking long and hard we haven't really being able to come with an idea that we think can one day become a great company. Ironically this motivated us to create Houston.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Houston is a site with a curated list of interesting problems that people have but have struggled to solve. The idea is that with time Houston becomes a repository of great business opportunities for entrepreneurs that are not sure where to start or don't have a great idea that they're passionate about.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built using a couple of open source libraries for the front end + React/GraphQL/MongoDB to rounds things off. We also use Figma to design certain key interactions.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    YC's firewall tripped us up
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shipping an MVP and making good trade-offs
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's important to identify your key value prop and build just that. Time is of the essence.

                    What's next for Houston
                </h2>
                <p>
                    So much! We need to improve the composer experience, mechanics for defining problems, twitter integration, profiles, settings and soo much more.
