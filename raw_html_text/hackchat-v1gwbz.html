                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Internet connects every one around the world and Facebook can provide a way for everyone to communicate with one another. But no one has came up with a tool to provide a solution to language barriers. We want to build a solution where a person living in one part of the world can communicate through our product with another person across the globe without having to learn another language. This experience will be as easy and as fast as texting your own family members.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HackChat is an international group chat that allows everyone around the world to communicate with one another in any language that the user has chosen. If a user is in Japan and can only speak in Japanese, he/she can still communicate and interact with everyone in this world group chat by either speaking or writing the messages in Japanese. Our product has the ability to recognize and detect speech from various languages and make a 1-to-1 translation to another available language. Which gives the user the ability to receive their response from other users back in their chosen language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In additional to speech recognition, our software has the text-to-speech ability which allows the user to hear their messages/responses in the language they chose. HackChat can individually help each user by translating every text messages into a message that is readable by the user despite the language that those messages were sent from.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a speech recognition was a challenge that we faced since there are not as much API library that we can use for this implementation. Another challenges that we faced was making sure that those translation and speech translation are all being returned correctly. At the same time, we ran into the challenge of finding each other strengths so that we could allocate the tasks to the right person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have the opportunity to represent our school, University of Massachusetts: Lowell, at HackUMass and we are very proud of our work and what we have accomplished with this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about firebase and implementing a chat group. Our biggest take-away from this week is to always take a break and have fun in all the things we do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackChat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We currently have HackChat as a web application because a web application is a lot easier to demo and prototype at a Hackathon, but our goal would be to finalize our design and release a mobile version of HackChat for people around the world. Before we can do all that, there are a lot of bugs to fix and features to add. To build a world where communication is only a click away.
