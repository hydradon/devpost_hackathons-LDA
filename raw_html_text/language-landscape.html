                <p>
                    One of the ways to learn a new language is to immerse yourself in it by labeling everyday objects with sticky notes. However, with this method, you are limited to common household objects. Language Landscape aims to aid your learning by digitally labeling objects around you.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using machine vision and translation, identify and label objects in the environment in both English and a foreign language.

                    I used Google Vision API to identify objects and Google Translate API to translate the words into a foreign language.
