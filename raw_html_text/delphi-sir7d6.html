                    We have all struggled in school and needing tutoring services, however paying $80 an hour just for tutoring is simply ridiculous.  Our new innovative tutoring exchange provides users with a new way to exchange tutoring services without impractical exchange rates.

                <p>
                    We have created a mobile application that matches users based on what class they can teach, and what class they need help in.  From this information it is able to pair users and create a mutual teaching relationship.

                    To create our app we used android studio for most of the coding and used firebase as a database to store any possible classes users may use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ended up learning a lot about android development considering none of us had worked with mobile apps such as android studio before.  We also learned about the implementation of database storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some future changes might be to create a face to face interface similar to google hangouts so users can conduct tutoring on our app itself and wouldn't need to change their platform.
