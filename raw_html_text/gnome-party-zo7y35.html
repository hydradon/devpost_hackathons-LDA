                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members was really interested in creating some form of educational game and everybody else in the group jumped on the idea. To deviate from the typical "game" experience, we decided to allow for smartphone using a library that we all had previously played on together before the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each player connects to the game through their smartphone using an AirConsole port (either a website or app) and takes turns controlling a garden gnome as it traverses its garden. Along the way, players will answer questions for the chance to gain currency to buy seeds to plant in the garden. The gnome that has the most seeds by the end of the match is declared the winner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We based the program in Unity that compiles in both C# and JavaScript. Logic for game objects was primarily written in JavaScript while the AirConsole integration was based in C# and HTML. Each object interacts with each other through Unity's native physics engine to allow movement along the board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge we ran into during this hackathon was the AirConsole integration. Due to the novelty of the library, documentation and error fixes came few and far between so integrating the system with the Unity base proved arduous.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a point in time that our group became unsure if the AirConsole implementation was going to work. After sticking to debugging for several hours, we were able to integrate the smartphone controllers into the program and run through a lap of the map with no issues. The fact that we were able to achieve something of this caliber during our first hackathon is something that we are really proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each of us gained some knowledge into the languages that we coded in. One member who had programmed in Unity before remarked that he learned more in the past 24 hours than he had in 2 months of casual coding he had done before. Another member coded for the first time in both C# and HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gnome Party
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gnome Party is still a work in progress that we plan to continue on. Many game mechanics still need to be implemented, including the question / answer system that will include question customization for teachers. Further map development, a game mechanic involving putting currency into a "bank" of sorts to gain seeds, and different event tile types are also in the works.
