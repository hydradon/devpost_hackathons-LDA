                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Kickstarter project, called "Nevermind," that uses biofeedback to enhance the game experience.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a survival horror game based in the future on a space station. It is supposed to get harder the higher your heart rate goes because that would reduce the total amount of oxygen available to you causing the surreal horror elements to get more prominent. the game makes use of oculus software to run in virtual reality.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it on the unity platform by importing several standard assets to compensate for our lack of graphic scales and then coding the first person camera and game objectives on a map made by systematic replication of the standard assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heart rate data was processed using moving average filtering followed by a FFT process.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GAME DEV IS V. TIME INTENSIVE, esp. with only 4 people. 
Cheap knockoff sensors with no support documentation = signal processing struggs.
Little experience with Unity game engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managed to get something off the ground.
Learned a lot about Unity, Arduino, etc.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't bite off more than you can chew.
Hardware can be fickle--don't trade quality for a a cheaper price.
