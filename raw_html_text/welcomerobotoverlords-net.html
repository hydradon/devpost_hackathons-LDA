                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to go for a domain name that appealed to some of the sponsors at BeachHacks. As you know Google and Northrop Grumman which are involved in AI/ML and embedded systems/robotics respectively. We came up with this name because welcomeRobotOverlords is the perfect combination of AI/ML as well as embedded systems/robotics. And last but not least the .net is a reference to Skynet from the Terminator series :))).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not much yet. It will be used in the future to welcome our oppressive robot overlords.
