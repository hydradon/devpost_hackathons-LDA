                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by recent natural disasters and acts of violence seen across America
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is designed for event and building management who could use Cisco Meraki&rsquo;s various features to improve safety and efficiency of evacuating a building or event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first gather the data given to us by the Meraki API. Then, we analyze the data along with floor plans of a building to associate each Meraki Access Point with a potential Emergency Exit. Finally, in the event that the location needs to be evacuated, our Python algorithm takes a live heat map and messages individual clients instructions on which route to take to ensure everyone responds quickly and safely to the threat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main challenges were trying to figure out how gather the data from Meraki&rsquo;s dashboard. After trying and failing with Node, we decided to use JSON directly from the dashboard
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to use the Meraki API, which seemed like a daunting task at first but we were motivated by the powerful technology and our belief in the project. Also, we discovered many new libraries and learned about different approaches we could have taken had we known about them earlier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned a lot about splitting problems into smaller parts and making use of the whole team to solve them. Seeing so much collaborative effort from each member was a first for us, we now know why teamwork is so important in building something useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emergenc Alert
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw that Cisco Meraki has many features that we did not have access to at the hackathon. One of these key features is the use of VOIP, which we would use to text specific clients in the building in the event of an emergency. Building a messaging system through Meraki or another service provider such as Twilio, would be next on the list of features to check off.
