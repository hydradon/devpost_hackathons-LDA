                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People in Tallahassee need one place to access all the different events, parks, trails and outdoor activities we have here. Cars are a big problem in our world, so we wanted to make these resources accessible to everyone &amp; connect them to the alternative transit options to get them there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an app that allows users to choose what they're interested in, browse events or locations where they can participate in these activities, and links them with the weather and transit information about each opportunity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Angular, Ionic, JavaScript and the Trailahassee, ArcGIS, and WeatherSTEM API's
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never built an app before, so it was very challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the ionic framework, how to integrate great API's to make Tallahassee better, and that naps fix everything.
                </p>
