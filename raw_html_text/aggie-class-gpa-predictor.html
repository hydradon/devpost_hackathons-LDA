                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create an easier way to help students determine the average GPA of a class section instead of manually browsing through the grade distribution data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It predicts the average class GPA for the semester professor and the section of your class from previous years' grade distribution data. For the prototype, it only  uses grade distribution data from CSCE 121.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML to code the website, and we used multiple-regression to make a formula on excel that predicts the average class GPA based on the semester, professor and the section of your class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we had intended to use a machine learning model on Google Cloud and a website registered on @domain.com called aggieclassinfo.tech with a server on Google Cloud for the GPA predictor; however, we weren't able to do so due to technical difficulties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a basic static website with an excel workbook file embedded in it which predicts average GPA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to navigate and partially use the AI platform on Google Cloud. We also learned about how to write HTML to code a website and use multiple-regression on Excel to predict a value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Aggie Class GPA Predictor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully making a categorical machine learning model with Google Cloud that takes all the class data from grade distribution website and is able to predict an average class GPA for the user through a dynamic website registered on @domain.com with a server on Google Cloud.
