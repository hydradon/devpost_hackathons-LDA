                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from lack of motivation to fitness and wellness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our leggings connect to a separate app that can personalized interval runs for the wearer. The LED lights notify the runner to speed up and the vibrations on the hips notify the runner to slow down. When both the LED lights flash and the hip areas vibrate, it notifies the runner to stop because he/she has completed their workout.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We constructed simple leggings using 4 way stretch tricot nylon span with small LED lights throughout the thigh area and a small motor on each hip that creates the vibrations. We then constructed a lining on the inside of the leggings to conceal wiring and intend to use the waistband to hold batteries and other components.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problems with the wires connecting to the LEDs throughout the leggings and the LEDs lighting up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the end, we figured out how to get the LED lights and vibrations working well and constructed compelling leggings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work with new technologies like LED lighting and Arduino, as well as new group work strategies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AVID
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would start taking out prototype into customer testing to see how well it communicates between the app and the user. Based on the collected data from these tests, we would develop a newer version of the app and leggings to fit into a runner's fitness lifestyle.
