                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to Zoopla, the average rent in Kensington for a 2 bedroom property is &pound;4,188 pcm. According to House Grabber, based on scraped Airbnb data, the average for rent for short term letting is &pound;6,405 pcm.  Short letting is clearly a smarter way to invest. But how and where in this booming London estate market? House Grabber will help you make the right decision!

                <p>
                    House Grabber provides a rich set of tools to analyze the real estate market in London and identify great opportunities to invest. This is based on long-term data supplied by Zoopla compared against short term letting sites like Airbnb.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We proudly scrapped the Airbnb website for its precious information, receiving a great IP ban for 4hours for the entire venue. After this successful hijack, we went after Zoopla, which turned out not to fight that hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the data was there it was time to hack with ESRI team. Successful collaboration created the best tool out there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    4 hours IP ban from Airbnb. Quite a lot of data from Zoopla to process and the overwhelming rich world of ESRI's API.
