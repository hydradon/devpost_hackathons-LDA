                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are designers from Sheridan College who wanted to create a game with social impact. When we were brainstorming about issues we could tackle, we wanted to make an educational game that didn't take away any of the fun factors. A theme that caught our attention was
                    <strong>
                        environment
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    Did you know that Toronto is the worst offender in recycling contamination with a whopping 26% rate? Or that 15% of the average homeowner's garbage is recyclable? In 2017, an estimated 55,000 tonnes of non-recyclabe material was going into blue bins! This is costing Toronto
                    <strong>
                        millions of dollars
                    </strong>
                    because people don't know any better. Some of the most common waste mistakes are:
&bull; Throwing out toys/applicances in the recycling bin thinking that someone will reuse it
&bull; Throwing out batteries into the garbage
&bull; Throwing out coffee cups into the blue bins when they belong in recycling
&bull; ...and the list goes on!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason this is happening is due to a
                    <strong>
                        lack of knowledge
                    </strong>
                    - after all, there's no government official telling us where to throw our garbage. Current products that exist in the market such as Waste Wizard or other waste management games/tools rely on people being proactive, but we put fun as priority so that learning comes naturally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made it our mission to start a movement from the bottom up - and it starts with children becoming more educated on where waste really belongs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our game teaches children about some of the most common recycling and garbage mistakes you can make, as well as alternatives such as donating.
                </p>

                    Join Pandee and Pandoo on their journey to sort through the 6ix's waste and put them in their place!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the
                    <strong>
                        Nintendo Joy Cons
                    </strong>
                    , players will control Pandee and Pandoo to sort through the trash that has landed in their backyard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The waste can be sorted into 5 different receptacles and players will need to use their wits to figure out which container it belongs in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is to use teamwork to get the most points possible and have the cleanest lawn while minimizing their impact on the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity and C# to bring it all together. Additionally, we used the joycon library to integrate the Nintendo switch controllers into the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble texturing the raccoon at the beginning because it didn't map properly onto the mesh. It was also difficult to integrate the Nintendo motion controls into the game design. It was the first time our team used it as our hardware and it proved to be difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to finish it without major bugs! It works and it has a lot of different emergent designs. The game itself feels like it has a lot of potential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game is a result of our 2 years of schooling - we used everything we learned to create this game. Shoutout to our professors and classmates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tibi: I learned that coffee cups go into the trash - I used to think they go in the recycling.
We also learned how to use the Nintendo joycons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Recoon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add secondary mechanics into the game to make it more interesting and flesh out the user experience.
