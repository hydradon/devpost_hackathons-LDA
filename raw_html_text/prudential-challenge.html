                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prudential Bank provided us with a challenge to complete during HackRU. This is our attempt.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using sample bank customer data, we created a website where you can log in with your bank credentials and it will show you your various account balances, expense vs. income data, and the ability to manage assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flask for python and the Yodlee API to create our webserver, and HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was using the Yodlee API. We spent a couple of hours learning how it worked, but after that, it was pretty easy to catch on to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website looks nice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Previously we had only worked with Node.js for web app backends, so we learned how to use Flask and gained some experience with python.
                </p>
