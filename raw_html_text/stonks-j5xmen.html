                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members, Himani, is interested in stock trading and currently taking a class on it and wanted to experiment with some stock trading APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a mock trading app for beginners, players are given a challenge which consists of a time period and a market summary to base their trades off, and have that period of time to buy and sell as much as they want to maximize their profits. There are 5 anonymous companies they perform trades with and the names of those companies are revealed at the end of the challenge and some context about the challenge. Our app only functions with Level 1 right now, which is the dot com bubble time period. Users will experience what the market conditions of a bubble is like and learn from their experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our backend is hosted on Google Cloud Platform and our database holds the historical pricing data for our 5 stocks. That data is grabbed using an api endpoint we created that connects to our front end which is designed with android studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we had a very broad idea for a practice stock trading app with unrestricted historical data and spent a lot of time scaling down to something realistic because of the restrictions with API calls for free APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our back end is fully up and running with an endpoint we call from, which we are proud of, it stores 5000 records from AlphaVantage for each stock we used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio was definitely a learning curve but it was interesting seeing the mechanics of android development and we learned a lot from it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stonks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we scaled down this project for the time restrictions we were under, there is a lot of potential features that were cut out of Stonks. Ideally it could be a full fledged trading app where the user isn't just restricted to 5 stocks but could trade any stocks they wanted within a time period and face different challenges based on the different time periods they were in.
