                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the things that makes the military community special is their trust within each other. A lot of the times they would rather have advice from members of their community than from technologies like Yelp! or Google, due to the great respect they have for each other. In addition, they often have to move constantly, so it's hard for them to create new connections every time they move.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an app that allows members of the military to find people around them who are also members of the military, and engage in their community. It does this by allowing them to post messages based on location and allowing them to answer posts from others near them. In addition, the app also lists places near them where they can find other members of the military or general resources they require.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built on Android using React-Native. The reason for this is because I wanted to create something that would easily be made cross-platform, and its ease-of-use was perfect for a hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React-Native is still fairly new, so a lot of the resources are not there yet. In addition, I don't know mobile well.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    It works.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that there's a lot of problems facing the military community, especially since they have to move so much. I also learned about how generally challenging making an app by yourself is.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I would like to incorporate accounts and improved UI to help people with disabilities.
