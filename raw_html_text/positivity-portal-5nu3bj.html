                <h2>
                    The Plan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fundamental goals for the project were to create a concept for a page where people can create an account and customize it based on their preferences, effectively teaching it how best to make them feel good. Then, in times of need, they can visit the site to be presented with a collecting of multimedia content designed to make them happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the demo, we have only a basic example of some affirmations, images of cute animals, and an inspirational quote. In later iterations of this project, we also see the following being core content that can be set up by users in advance:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Messages from family/friends/others that remind people about their positive qualities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Specific affirmation preferences that are more effective for specfic users. For example, they could select "I like affirmations that remind me that I'm smart," or "I want to be told I look good."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Links to images/videos online that are either specifically entertaining or comforting to the user.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In cases where people simply need something to focus their attention on that isn't their own negative thoughts, we have a soft, animated background with customizable color palette. The simple animation is designed to draw a user in and give them something to focus on while collecting themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Roadmap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The current demo doesn't include the user creation flow or a backend. The next steps would be introducing a backend for some long-term persistence. This app lends itself to be deployed on Firebase fairly easily, relying heavily on the realtime database for per-user customizations as well as base datasets.
