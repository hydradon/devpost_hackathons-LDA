                    APIS Used
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Vision Product Search offers pre-trained machine learning models through REST and RPC APIs. It assign labels to images and quickly classify them into millions of predefined categories. For ProPrice, the Product Search API is specifically trained to detect objects from within our catalogue and identifies their similarities.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        GOOGLE MAPS PLATFORM (GMP) PLACES API
                    </strong>
                    We used GMP Places API to identify nearest stores from the user that has their desired product in stock at the lowest price!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        PRODUCT PRICE SEARCH
                    </strong>
                    We used the Best Buy Keyword Search API which offers developers access to retail data, including prices, offers, and sales by searching across several common attributes, such as item name and brand name.
We couldn't get approved API Keys for other stores in time, so we decided to develop our own web-scraping microservice module which we would query for Amazon and Walmart. Overall, with these three APIs provided by large commerce companies, a price match can be made and links to the online sites are provided to the user.
