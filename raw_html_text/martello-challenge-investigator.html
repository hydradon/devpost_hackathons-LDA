                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going through the data, one could see that each log can reveal the actions taking place at the indicated time (eg: if a user connected to the hallway's Wifi, one can safely assume that the guest walked the the hall to reach a certain destination) While scrolling the thousands of codes to follow what each guest is up to is a nice aproach, I figured why not make a program that will do it for the forensic team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program translates every data entry into a spot that represents a guest. Its position on the map changes accordingly with the timestamps so it provides a real time presentation of each action that took place and how long it took till its achievement.
This will give a visual representation of the exact course of events that took event the night of the crime with an easy to use set of tools that will allow the user to track what happened exactly in order to reveal the circumstances of the mystery exactly as they happened.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python, I made sure every entry is to be analysed to reveal the locations the guests visited and the correspending times. The program will also assign N/A events where no ID is indicated (such as using elevators and accessing certain rooms) to the correct user following the logic of the circumstances around it (time and geolocation). Every entry is then to be transformed into an an easy to follow visualizer on the hotel plan that will re-enact the exact course of events as they took place the night of the murder.
                </p>

                    What's next for Martello Challenge Investigator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the fact I was working I'm not very proud of the functionalities my program has to offer as of now. 
A completed version will allow:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A tool to pause the flow of events to track the guest positions at frozen points in time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A fast forward tool to accelerate through frames
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A play-backwards tool to replay a certain period of time in case the user missed any detail
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A next/previous event button that will allow skipping through events outside of the time flow
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A tool to show one character at a time/ or the whole set of guests for a more concentrated scenrio
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A tool that concentrates on one room at a time to show a detailed log of which guests went inside and at what times
