                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tired of going through a thousand steps to send a screenshot via email. Our inspiration was the iPhone's screenshot feature where you can take a screenshot and quickly send it via email.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) User navigates to anywhere on their computer and press (
                    <strong>
                        ctrl + enter
                    </strong>
                    ) to trigger the event handler
2) User is notified that the screenshot will be sent to help desk, which is a dummy email address created for this project (
                    <strong>
                        <a href="mailto:SC-helpdesk-girlshack@protonmail.com" rel="nofollow">
                            SC-helpdesk-girlshack@protonmail.com
                        </a>
                    </strong>
                    )
3) Handler will check if the path "C:\HelpDeskScreenshot" exists on the user's computer. If it doesn't, it'll create it. If it exists, it skips to the next step
4) User will be asked to set a priority for the email (low, medium, high)
5) Handler will launch the Outlook client and send the email to help desk
6) Handler will delete screenshot to save space on the client's computer

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used UiPath Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating variables to later assign to other activities was kind of tricky.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first time we used this app and are proud that we were able to build something like this in less than 24 hrs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to navigate the UiPath interface, and that even though we're already creating an automated process, UiPath is automating that for us too. We didn't have to enter any "from" address to send the email as the program searched for that automatically.
                </p>
