                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create convenient security system that would let home owners identify who visited their house that day. Our idea was to make the device portable and compact. This kind of technology would help people live easier and safer lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a security system such that when a visitor comes to your door, a camera will recognize a human is standing in front of the camera. It then takes a photo, identifies the person standing there, and notifies the home owner who visited their house that day and at what time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Dragonboard 410C and a webcam for the image capture and processing. OpenCV was used for facial recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for us!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We tried a lot to integrate with Alexa and AWS, and given some time, we think we can make an Alexa skill which uses Amazon's facial rekognition API to identify people.
