                        47% of B2B (Business to Business) payments
                    </strong>
                    in the US. However, there currently isn't a global payments solution to replace paper checks for small businesses. On top of this, checks are slow, wire payments can take up to 5 days before the funds are credited into the account, real-time payments are limited and rarely available for small businesses.

                    </strong>
                    for sending and requesting payments your way. Whether you want to request a real-time payment from a customer, or make a credit card payment to purchase supplies, PayUp has you covered. 
PayUp can
                    <strong>
                        plug and play
                    </strong>
                    into any online banking solution and integrates with common ERP systems for auto-populating key fields. PayUp harnesses the power of Fusion Global PayPlus via APIs for processing and accessing the different clearing houses.  When a business chooses to use Fusion PayUp, they
                    <strong>
                        reduce paper checks

                <p>
                    Fusion PayUp is a payment initiation and request to pay portal that leverages the APIs for Global PayPlus. PayUp
                    <strong>
                        enables all payment types

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fusion PayUp was prototyped using
                    <strong>
                        MintData
                    </strong>
                    , a UI development tool with built-in API support. PayUp uses the "Client Information" API to aggregate client accounts. Using those accounts, it calls the "Real-Time Payment Initiation", "Payment Request", and "Payment Request-Pay Now,Pay Later,Reject" APIs hosted by
                    <strong>
                        Fusion Global PayPlus
                    </strong>
                    to send and request payments.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    For the hackathon, we took a risk and leveraged an
                    <strong>
                        unknown UI development tool
                    </strong>
                    called Mintdata.  The tool was powerful and helpful in many ways but there was also a learning curve for
                    <strong>
                        our sole developer
                    </strong>
                    .  We collaborated closely with the Mintdata team in Europe who stayed with us after hours to provide support, allowing Dustin to finish the prototype. Another challenge we faced was the limited data provided by the Client Information API.
