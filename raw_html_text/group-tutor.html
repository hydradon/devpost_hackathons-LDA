                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our current system as students in the CSE department sucks. We wanted to make something better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Group Tutor uses Natural Language Processing to group people submitting help tickets with other students who are facing similar problems, so that they can work together to fix the issue, and have a tutor present to a group of students once rather than multiple times over and over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Javascript for the app and Google Cloud storage, and used Python for the NLP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Google Cloud was not cooperating with our Python code, and had some issues with uploading functions to actually process data coming in from the apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Very accurate preliminary NLP matching using real-world data pulled from the tutor history of the current system. One of our teammates is a tutor, so he was able to help us get an initial data set to test with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about app development, cloud storage, and natural language processing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Group Tutor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fleshing out its features and making it more robust! There's lots left to do for making it a better app.
                </p>
