                    Hello !
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're a group of sleep-less tech hobbyist trying to make this world a better place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project we're working on a service that will connect people allowing them to share meals as well as save time and money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We distinct two types of users:
Host, who creates one time or regular dining events, specyfing its location, time, cuisine type and price to be paid by guests for joining. We also develop tools for him to make the experience even better, like an intelligent price calculator for dishes which will suggest a fair price and a tool to select guests based on their profiles, which include interest, reviews from previous meetings and short self description.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Guest,  who can browse the list of events in his location distinguished by type of cuisine used, price and proximity
he has also see a description of the host and his view on the dining event to be hosted, describing the atmosphere and conditions on which it will be held as well as the obvious price expected to be paid by him
