                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Interested in multimedia game design and development and exploring new platforms for games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tracks a specific AR code through a camera and displays a simple 3D map and battle on the code card.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Vuforia's API for tracking the images, and Unity's engine for AI and handling the actual game play and logic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges were plenty, time was a big constraint. Writing the AI and debugging to a semi-polished level took a large bulk of the time. Also running into challenges where we were often forced to shift the general design of the game in order to complete the core elements.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud of the sheer amount of work and coding I've done. I really had a great chance to write a lot of AI and really create something from scratch. 
I hadn't used Unity before this hackathon and I learned a lot about making 3D objects and so on - am proud of having made some kind of turret that worked.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We all learned a lot about developing on Unity in 3D.
