                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were trying to think of things college students would need. We went through a lot of different ideas such as focusing towards different majors, but decided that procrastination is by far one of the biggest problems college students face.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tracks time usage of the user and displays a pie chart of where they are putting their time. Hopefully, this display will cause the user to be guilt tripped into being productive.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studios. We implemented multiple ArrayLists that allowed us to create new scroll tabs and also design a pie chart.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many different challenges. The first challenge was getting to know how to use Android Studios. We were very confused and couldn't understand what the code was doing in the examples and templates. We ran into problems where we would make a minor change and all of a sudden, everything would end up failing. We encountered other problems with the Android emulator and it also became very annoying when we tried to test the code over different laptops because each one ran differently and produced a different result.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We slowly but surely got familiar with Android Studios. It came to the point where we all kind of knew what was going on instead of being completely lost. We were able to solve some problems that came up relatively easily. We also managed to finish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics on how to code in Android Studios. We also learned how complex a language you might think you're familiar with can be. We learned we really didn't know what in the world we were doing and that our previous, very limited knowledge of Android Studios, was useless. We learned that staying awake for long periods of time while trying to create cohesive code is a pain. We learned that group coding projects are difficult and require very clear communication and teamwork.

                    What's next for TimeTracker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll probably add more of the complex features we brainstormed in the beginning such as app tracking usage and reminders/suggestions.
