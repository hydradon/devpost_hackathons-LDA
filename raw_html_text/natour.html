                <h1>
                    What it does:
                </h1>
                <p>
                    NaTour is an app that allows it's users to take a picture of animals/insects found in the wild. The app then identifies the species and brings up useful information that the user might enjoy. When the picture is taken, the species is then "pinned" on the map for the public to see. So if you are looking for a specific species, you are able to check the map on the website and discover where it has recently been seen! This is also good to help scientists and the government to track migration patterns and extinct species.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How it works:
                </h1>
                <p>
                    NaTour works by using Google's Machine Learning Vision API. This allows NaTour to identify what it is seeing in the picture. The app then uses the Wolfram API to find out relative information about the species. Whenever a picture is taken the app takes the current location as well as the type of animal and uses FireBase to store the info. The website and map can then read the information from FireBase to display data about the species. The entire app is coded in react native using expo.io.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Throughout the course of the hackathon we ran into several problems. Primarily because several of us were new to hackathons in general and we were all new to the technologies we were using.  We also found it extremely difficult to integrate the Google Cloud Vision API into our expo.io app. Lastly, it was very difficult merging all our parts together. After completing the four main parts individually, it was extremely difficult putting all the pieces together to make one final app.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What we are most proud of:
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Being able to learn so much in such a short period of time. We were all able to learn new technologies including React Native, expo.io and Google Cloud Services. Our entire team was new to all of these and we are extremely proud that we were able to learn them so quick and overcome the many obstacles that we did face.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Whats Next For NaTour?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Be able to place cameras in public places such as parks that are also able to update the maps if an animal is spotted. This way, the map does not only rely on humans physically seeing the species. This could be done using Android Things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps introducing a social aspect/ using gamification. This would allow the users to gain points for the more species that they capture and would allow them to compete against friends to capture the most "points."
