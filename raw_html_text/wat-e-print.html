                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stemmed from the company challenge issued by Ecolab. It was also decided upon due to the concerns surrounding the harsh environmental conditions in Australia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app tracks water used per day by asking the user to recount their daily food consumption and water related activities. It allows the user to set goals and see how they are doing compared to their past records. It also serves as a way of informing users on the water conservation issue and steps to help avail it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used Flutter, a development software for designing apps. This used languages such as dart and python. We also loaded in relevant data through a csv file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few challenges concerning how we can let the user keep track of their records of previous days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to create an app that functions enough to be able to showcase our ideas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the relevant skills associated with this project, such as flutter and dart.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we plan to add a way to keep track of the previous days, as well as provide personalized goals based on the user's lifestyle.
