                    <li>
                        Most images captured by modern smart phone cameras contains location data. Our original plan was to extract geotags from a single image that we asked users to take of the animal. We didn't know that when images are sent over SMS, they are stripped of their metadata. Instead, we asked users to submit their location directly, which puts more burden on them but was ultimately more elegant from an engineering standpoint and guarantees more complete data.
