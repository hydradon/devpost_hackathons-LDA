                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being inexperienced, we were all wondering what the possibilities of data science and data visualization were. Because of that, we wanted to see to what extent we could parse through large amounts of data in order to then put it into an effective visualization tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What it does, is that it manages to show all the sensor events and how the people correlate to that event. This manages to create an effective visualization tool for detectives and other forensic scientists instead of needing to parse through data. This tool can later on be built so that it can extend not only to this case, but rather any case that has large amounts of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the backend through Python 3, and then integrated that into the frontend using the PyQt5 library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team in general, have little experience within the field of software development. We ran into the issue of having to learn GitHub properly, and how to integrate and download properly the PyQt5 library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned GitHub and how to create a proper GUI using the PyQt5 library, something that we had not previously done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>

                    See above.

                <p>
                    Next steps would be to somehow parse through the data to be used in a general case, and maybe to be used simply as a simulation tool. Also, we would make full use of the json file, to account for situations like leaving/entering a room being displayed differently, despite both events being registered on the same sensor.
