                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to build my first hardware hack and found no better way than to interact with touch technologies. I also wanted to work with vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Draw symbols, and the computer will speak them to you as shape names.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wrote python scripts to generate baseline values for LCD gray-scale gradient. Then based on average base-line relative values, we determined the x,y coords of the touched areas. Touched areas represented high values (&lt;255 RGB) and from there we recorded midpoints to determine the points we want to have selected. In the end we use image post-processing with open-cv to analyze curvatures and edges. With this data we were able to flatten matrices and determine basic shapes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the drivers installed with the Synaptic touch board.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That it works and speaks to you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to geometrically define boundaries for shapes using open-cv and scaling images to represent the larger tablet.
