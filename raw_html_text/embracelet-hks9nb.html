                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out by investigating the human senses and how we choose to perceive the world around us. It became clear to us that sight was
                    <strong>
                        by far
                    </strong>
                    the most dominent sense. In a complex and increasingly disconncted world, we wanted to bring people closer together and in a whole new and authentic fashion. We chose to focus on our sense of smell, since this is the best sense at recollecting memories. Meanwhile, a french company is allowing customers to purchase a perfume based on the personal scent of their loved ones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Embracelet(TM) allows people to feel more connected with one another, regardless of physical distance. It combines the sense of touch with the sense of smell by triggering a physical response via touch with the personal scent of a loved one, making personal and authentic connection possible. 
Embracelet(TM) is a bracelet with a touch-surface that transmits touch from one bracelet to another by vibration. Further, a small compartment holds a tiny piece of absorbent that has been drenched in the personal perfume. The compartment is closed which ensures a controlled approach as to when and where the smell is active.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The build is a two-part build:
                    <strong>
                        Firstly
                    </strong>
                    a concept-model was built in Photoshop which serves as a guideline towards the final product design.
                    <strong>
                        Secondly
                    </strong>
                    a prototype was built with Arduino boards, bluetooth connectors, a button (to simulate touch) and a buzzer (to simulate vibration).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our technical capabilities are basically none-existant, so making the prototype proved to be a huge challenge. We spent most of our time developing and maturing the concept behind the design, and less time on actually building it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel that we have come up with a novel and interesting design-concept that when built correctly has a potential in the real world. Further, our preliminary goals and design-principles have been well met, and we are proud to have come up with a unique take on how we experience the world and stay connceted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we are capable of creating something interesting, wacky but useful on the basis of different design-concepts, restrictions and principles. However, we also learned that our technical skills are lacking severely, but also that we have the curiosity to learn more about physical prototypes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Embracelet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We need to build and test a more functional prototype. This will allow us to understand what Embracelet is lacking and perhaps whether it's
                    <em>
                        too
                    </em>
                    wacky or novel.
