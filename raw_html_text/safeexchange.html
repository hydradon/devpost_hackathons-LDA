                    Internet exchanges are always tricky. Neither party can ensure they&rsquo;ll get what they were promised because of potential scammers. Secure Exchange aims to solve this issue of mistrust by facilitating these transactions in a transparent and secure manner. Using the Ethereum blockchain, our messenger bot facilitates payment and the exchange of goods and services to make individual commerce more trustworthy.
