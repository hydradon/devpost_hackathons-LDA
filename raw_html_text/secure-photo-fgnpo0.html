                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After using an existing image manager on Blockstack, I noticed the pictures were actually not being stored in Gaia nor was that communicated. They were also available to the public if you had the fileName.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to create albums, upload photos. Image downloading, deleting coming soon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Angular 7 and TypeScript. I am using Clarity VM for UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Found storing images to be hard and slow. Hoping to learn more about how I can store this on Gaia faster, currently using base64 encoding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting it to finally work, I have not worked with images before and found that to be a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to work with images and how Blockstack auth and storage work.
                </p>

                    What's next for Secure-Photo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will be building out the album feature, image organization with deletion and ability to download. Looking into ways to increase performance so looking at Gzip client side and image compression. As well as multiple file upload with drag and drop.
