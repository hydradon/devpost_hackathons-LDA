                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students are too lazy to buy groceries. Students are too lazy to get off Facebook. Why not combine them both and allow students to buy food and procrastinate at the same time?
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Facebook Messenger chatbot allows users to choose between searching by a product and by a recipe. Searching by product will return them relevant search results which can then be viewed in more detail. Searching by recipe allows the user to submit an ingredient or dish and receive recipe suggestions. Selecting one will then enable them to order all the required ingredients through Loblaws.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using Node.js and Heroku. The entire team was new to JavaScript, and this we spent a great deal of our time learning. We divided the features between team members and worked at them, before finally coming together for testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Loblaws Digital API is very limited, and doesn't allow users to save to cart or reference back to their website. The posed a large issue for us when created the app. Also, being new to the platform we were using posed as a challenge, but has ultimately been a learning experience.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of learning JavaScript and working with the various APIs. We're also happy with our perseverance through the many issues and frustrating times we had.
