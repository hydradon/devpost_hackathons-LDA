                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to make an app that will be relevant to users in a few years we needed to realize which users will be the most prominent in the future. Those users will be today&acute;s young people. It took us more time to realize than we&acute;d like to admit that we are, in fact, those users. Therefore we could simply ask ourselves what we felt was missing from the current mobile banking experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The banking app has all the features of &Iacute;slandsbanki&acute;s current app and adds a few important features. The new app will be able to analyze transaction data and visualize it for users. This would result in users being able to have better oversight of their day-to-day finances. We also added "Diddi the advisor" who would use the user&acute;s data to recommend certain loans, credit cards or savings plan. Our main idea, however, was to add a feature that splits certain transactions between groups of people. You could therefore be in a few groups at a time, e.g. "family", "friends", or use a group that has a specific time frame.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a mock up of the app online using html. The site is in no way secure and should not be used for actual transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few obstacles when we were trying to fine tune the idea of the Groups. However, we overcame them!

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The groups would be a fantastic addition to the current banking apps since we constantly have to make small transactions manually.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we are all a lot more interested in financial software solutions than we thought before starting this project.
