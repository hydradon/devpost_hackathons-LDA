                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving out after College is a lot more wasteful than you'd think. Most people have furniture they've procured over the year that they don't know what to do with. Either it's too expensive to ship back home or they can't find someone to sell too in time. What ends up happening is loads of furniture on the streets or in dumpsters  So, we've come up with a solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wehaul is an app that takes your furniture for free. All you have to do is take a picture, fill out details, and we pick it up the next day. Once we take your furniture to one of our warehouses, we will either upload the furniture to the our app for others to browse or store. Using the app, you can search and find whatever furniture you want and even watch an AR demo of it to see how it'd fit into your living space. Once you find one you like, you buy it and we ship to your door. It's that simple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android-studio for the app and sql to develop a database. The AR functionality will also come through android-studio's AR Core.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever actually used android-studio or sql prior to this hackathon, so everything was a challenge. But luckily we persevered through to make an app concept that we truly believe in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The AR demo looks and feels like what we'd eventually like to see in our own app, besides that everything is an accomplishment as we don't have much formal coding experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how Android's SDK works and all the little bugs that can be produced due to it's scaling layout. We also learned how to write and display .sql files as a .cps text file.
