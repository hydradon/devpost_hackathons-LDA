                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike universities, our campus does not have a virtual tour nor is our campus extensively mapped on Google's Street View. So we decided to create a low-cost alternative to accomplish what those two resources help with: showing incoming students how to get to their classes in real time compared to static maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile application would help incoming students find their way across campus, to faculty and administrative offices as well as to their classrooms. It is designed to visualize the inside of campus buildings and provide students with an interactive map which shows the locations of rooms as well as faculty and administrative offices instead of just an overview.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile application was built using Android Studio along with Google Maps API. We used the floor plan to outline the inside of the building.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Limited time, inexperience, and lack of documentation on some resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Android Studio, integrating an API into a mobile app, and building team skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio, understanding and interacting with API's, map editing and modeling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Campus Maps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Incorporate 508 compliant accessibility standards. Integrate an indoors view much like Google's "Street View" or a Virtual Tour to help incoming students even further. Add other building levels to the design. Add location details from Google Maps.
