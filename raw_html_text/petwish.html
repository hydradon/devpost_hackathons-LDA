                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every year, about 4 Million healthy and adoptable pets are killed each year in America's shelters. They deserve a much better fate and we are committed to provide them a happy life with a loving owner through PetWish!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides a way for Pet-lovers to post their wishes (i.e.their desired animal companion) and for PetSantas (anyone who knows about a homeless animal) to fulfill their wishes!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have provided the layout of the plan in the PowerPoint Presentation included in this submission, please refer. We envision it to be a website, an app and as explained in the presentation, even as a possible mobile Game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Increasing exposure and active participation in the homeless pets rehabilitation process was something we are constantly looking to improve. For example - PetSantas might actively participate only if they have a genuine personal interest. Otherwise, we can solve the problem by inviting 3rd party sponsorship to give gifts/coupons for each goal they achieve (i.e. each PetWish they fulfill)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We believe our idea significantly eliminate Animal shelters as middle men in the process of rehabilitating homeless pets.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Provided alternate means of (better) rehabilitation instead of depending solely on individual adopters.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are so many ways we can avert the yearly tragic deaths, just need the right approach, by making the process more inclusive and rewarding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PetWish
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in the last slide in the presentation included, we wish to explore games as a way to further our battle against pet homelessness - example case study would be a concept inspired from the widely popular game Pokemon Go.
