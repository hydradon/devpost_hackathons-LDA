                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our experiences with food waste at home, when buying too much and having to throw away expired items from the fridge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An Alexa skill that keeps track of what you tell it that you put in or take out of the fridge. Also keeps track of expiration dates. A mobile app provides a visual interface to view the currently stored items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Amazon Alexa, Node.js and React Native. Also DynamoDB on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Exposing API from DynamoDB, and interpreting and displaying it in React Native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Documentation is really important. Planning integrations is best done early. Refactoring code needs to be done before it takes an unreasonable amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fridge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integration with IBM's Watson Chef to suggest recipes for items currently stored.
Reminders to use items that will expire soon.
Option to set earlier reminders for very perishable items.
