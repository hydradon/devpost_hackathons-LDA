                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to learn how to use augmented reality in a video game application. We wanted the user to feel bigger and empowered because many are bullied in their childhoods.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What can the user do?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our game, the player is a giant monster-like godzilla and gets to destroy a city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How our game was built.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our game using Unity3d, C#, and exported our game on the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) with XR support. We sent each build over the network to the HoloLens to test different features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing for the HoloLens was hazardous and time consuming when it came to mapping out different space. Also, Unity3d has a different startup time than the HoloLens. ALSO! Microsoft HoloLens projects cannot be developed on Mac/Linux machines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we are proud of!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We figured out how to place objects on the environment and spatially map out terrain. This was a huge step in our project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We actually felt like godzilla and we never gave up on this vision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned basic coding in c#, how to develop in Unity, how to develop for a HoloLens and map objects to a generated mesh.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Bigger You
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are going to continue using what we learned to build a greater and even BIGGER augmented reality project for senior design (EECS 582).
