                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each day, the news highlights several unfortunate stories regarding fatalities due to the fact that medical personnel could not help on time. We decided to attack this problem by creating a platform which allows bystanders to contact emergency services without wasting any time. We have been inspired to help thousands of people across the world!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app contacts designated emergency services with the click of a button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio, P4P was carefuly crafted to provide an efficient, and user-friendly UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our primary struggle was implementing the Google Maps API and displaying the longitude and latitude.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our very first time working with API's. We carefully chose the most appropatire and suitable API for our project. Ultimately, we managed to make full use of the API's capabilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first interaction with the Android Studio IDE. Our past work included strictly web development and web applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Push4Police
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we would like to develop this application for iOS. iOS is home to millions of users. Through the release of the app on a second platform, we can spread this novel solution to ensure future safety for everyone.
