                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our love of bubble tea. Finding bubble tea is quite often hard and challenging. Sometimes you want pearl milk tea or other times you want passion fruit tea with grass jelly. There are always too many choices to pick from and too many bubble tea places to go!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Big Bobba Boyz provides a clear and easy to use web application that allows users to search for any type of bubble tea they like. From the ordinary pearl milk tea to the extravagant lemon yakult with coffee jelly, the web application will provide what stores offer the drink you want, the sizes/prices of the drink, and the directions to the stores that offer it. It's a user-friendly application that all can enjoy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a variety of tools and applications such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into was integrating the database with the web application. Another challenge we faced was parsing our received JSON object and displaying appropriate data onto the webpage drop-down menu.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of developing a csv to MongoDB database parser, backend parsers, and also the front end GUI and user-friendly web interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. In addition, we also learned the importance of teamwork and communication when pushing to our local git and also merging files.
                </p>

                    What's next for Boba Tea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to move this application forward and extend the user-friendly features as well as the backend. In addition, this app could be used for any company that wants to advertise their products and enhance their business needs as well as the user-friendly interface that their customers will be using.
