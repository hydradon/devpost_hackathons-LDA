                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>      Our group 4 freshmen different in all walks of life developed a device called FeedYourpet. We were inspired by the problem of people forgetting to feed their dogs or needing their dogs to be fed while they were away for vacation, having all but one of our group members, we could easily relate to this problem, and went to develop a solution. FeedYourPet allows for people's dogs (and cats!) to have their food automatically. The food will be given in certain quantities to allow for one's pet to not be over or underfed, determined by whatever amount the user set. The current model for the FeedYourPet is made out of cardboard, Arduino and its accessories, and a soda can. It is taped and hot glued together to keep it in place and to maintain a solid structure. The automated parts are used with an Arduino board to control the systems, and was all coded within the Arduino IDE. There were a few challenges that we ran into while brainstorming and working on our product. The first problem was coming up with a proper design, we thought of a few different ideas for dispensing the dog/cat food, ways of measuring the amount of food dispense through mass, or an estimate off time, with some variables such as the differing size of food pellets. Some of our prized accomplishments include being able to use Arduino board, being able to design our model design, and being able to easily communicate as a unit and dividing the work between one another equally and in a well-organized matter. Through this project being a difficult process, we all have been able to learn numerous techniques on Arduino, and basic circuiting. Making the model become a reality, having a working full sized FeedYourPet and allowing it to be a now reality to any pet owners. The goal would be to make the FeedYourPet an affordable and convenient household product for any pet lover, and responsible pet owner.
