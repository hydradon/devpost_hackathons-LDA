                    Ideas
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought of what inventive type of password an end user would enjoy to use... Something that is
                    <em>
                        common
                    </em>
                    to every person, but each one is (mostly)
                    <em>
                        unique
                    </em>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Music!
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone likes music. We came up with the idea of playing your favourite tune to unlock your phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Functionality
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can select an instrument and record your tune by tapping on the on screen keys. You can save many passwords/melodies. Only
                    <em>
                        your
                    </em>
                    melody can get you through your lock screen! Ideally, you could set up any of these passwords for any app, and we would integrate many different types of instruments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started off with a few core objects and one screen. As the requirements expanded over time we created more screens and fleshed out said objects with concrete code such as creating file IO.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had an idea to get past the lock screen by playing an
                    <strong>
                        actual
                    </strong>
                    instrument next to your phone. This would've been
                    <em>
                        super secure
                    </em>
                    because you would have needed to go home to play your grand piano! Or you could set up a simpler instrument that you can 'fake' anywhere such as a drum - unlocking it through a series of claps. Unfortunately recognising sound waves was
                    <em>
                        too complex
                    </em>
                    to invoke for this hack. We would've liked to add more instruments too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the keys to play notes through a library we found on github that plays midi notes of different pitches depending on your input. Reading the musical key presses and saving them into a file on your phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Better understanding of how to integrate libraries and how to use android studio - especially regarding setting the layout relative to other elements.
