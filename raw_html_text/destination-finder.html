                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was how many people like to travel but they aren't able to make decisions based on their money and what they want to do. We wanted something that could challenge us and allow this to help us learn and make it strengthen our skill sets to better our knowledge on computer science and the language we used (C++). We learned that we could work together and put our independent knowledge to the test and make something that can help us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code allows for the user to input information such as their budget. This allows the system to pick places and activities that they can do based on the budget. The code uses many preset destinations that could refer the person to specific areas! These preset destinations are taken by data that has been researched through traveling open sources. This research allowed the coders to input certain destinations and allow the code to pick certain things out for the person.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built using C++. We used many variables to help us along the way. The code uses many functions and statements to allow for recommendations which is used to pick a destination based on what the user put down as their input. With our limited knowledge we made this to be as robust as possible given our knowledge of coding. By using many variables and functions we were able to make a code that challenged us

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into are the creation of the menus. The menus where made using the library conio.h which allows us to make a good looking menu allowing us to clear the screen to reduce clutter. The time limit was very short so it did spark a sense of urgency when making the code. We struggled with structuring our time and making a decision. The code was difficult at first with the numerous bugs that it had but at the end the bug fixes helped.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of many things. In honesty we were surprised we made a good working program with the given time frame. the many bugs that we thought were impossible to fix actually got fixed and we were able to get a good and clear idea of what to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to work in a stressful environment and we learned to do things within a time frame that was decently hard for beginning coders. We did learn many things due to research and it was very fun. The things we learned making our code enforced and added to our knowledge of the language

                    What's next for Destination Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This code is very baron but if we were to continue it we would try to make it as robust as possible with many other features and many more options that could better the code and the program as a whole we originally wanted to make an app but we didn't have the knowledge to really do it but if we learned more we might be able to add more things the program
