                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to think of a way to stop the waste of food in the restaurent industry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helps connect restaurants to an application that allows them to post food that will be thrown away. The food being thrown away could be perfectly fine, but due to time contraints or company policy they are destined for disposal. Our application allows these restaurents to sell their food at a discounted price or for free instead of throwing it away.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML and the Bootstrap library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We changed our project multiple times due to unfamiliar technologies being used and gaps in experience between team members. We eventually came to a decision to work with languages that were simple to learn for beginners.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning basic web development in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If there is an easier way to create something in line with our ideas, it is better to do that instead of using something that is unfamilar and complex.

                    What's next for WasteHero
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, it is just a shell with a user interface. This could be deployed to many restaurants that have leftover meals ready to be sold rather than thrown away.
