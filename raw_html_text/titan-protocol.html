                <p>
                    As a miner, we were looking for ways to raise money to buy more equipment. We learned about Lightning payment channels and Rainbow channels through some friends. We came up with this idea for how investors could use payment channels as a way to fund startups. The goal of the

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent A LOT of time learning how to work with LND to do what we wanted with the payment channels. Our protocol was done in Lucidchart. We forked the lndash project to create an "originators dashboard" that makes interfacing with LND easier by adding functionality for creating/paying invoices and opening/funding channels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with the testnet proved too challenging. We could not make the move from regtest to testnet. With more time and energy, it could be configured. We worked to get it set up on bare metal servers which had its own problems. We had challenges managing all the moving parts of the project. We only added some basic functionality to the lndash to make the titan protocol possible. With more time, we could add more function into the application to support more parts of the protocol, specifically calculating the NAV and sending payments and invoices automatically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to successfully demonstrate our protocol on Regtest and we look forward to getting it setup on the Testnet. We are proud that we were able to get up and running with Lightning Network Daemon so quickly as well. The community provides great resources that made this very easy.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    We learned how the Bitcoin network works with Lightning. We also learned about rainbow channels and some of the new and innovative design patterns that can be supported on the Lightning network.
