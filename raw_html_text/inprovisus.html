                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The market potential was discovered from the vacancy of intervention before the patient gets his foot into the hospital door. ER costs are quite high which makes visit to ER a hard decision, passing critical time threshold. ER is also where hospitals lose a lot of money in as well and could use operational improvement.
                </p>
