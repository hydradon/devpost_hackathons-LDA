                <p>
                    Many current free language-learning apps lose user following because they fail to engage their user. With virtual reality, our users can theoretically be immersed into the environment that they are trying to learn about.

                        Oculingo
                    </strong>
                    immerses the user in a scene with many different objects to identify.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity for our 3D models and interaction with the Oculus. For voice recognition and text-to-speech we used Microsoft's Speech API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our larger obstacles was with voice recognition. Initially, our voice recognition method only supported English so when we checked for the Spanish solution by spelling it phonetically as if it were English (instead of 'abajo' we spelled 'abaho'). We were able to fix this by changing the localization settings that the .dll file pointed to
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    We are proud that it works, its educational, and fun!

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Unity and thought a good amount about UX in VR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Oculingo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An easy addition to Oculingo would be to add many more scenes/ rooms. We could also improve on voice recognition and implement more vocabulary than just nouns.
