                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiriation for this project came from me wanting to learn better tools and techniques for hacking, as I have an immense interest for hacks and cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many challenges I ran into is the fact that although most of the web exploit challenges were recycled from last year, they patched things I never expected to be patched. One specific example of this was the fact that a website required a SSTI exploit in order to obtain config. I did the normal test payload, only to find they sanitised the input, meaning I had to find another way to get in, or a completely different exploit. Something as simple as a basic SQL Injection turned into me turning on Burp Suite in an attempt to include spaces to make the injection work and not fritz out.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many accomplishments I had through this experience, one of which being the typing game. The typing game gave you lines of commands to run in a "command line", with 60 seconds on the clock. Now, I don't consider myself a fast typer, but when the pressure was on, I was Speedy Gonzales with my typing. There was also the cryptography section, something I'm usually bad at, but I excelled at, creating many Vignere ciphers in an attempt to decipher an autobiography with a flag.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned quite a lot from this CTF, some new skills, some improved skills. I learned a lot on the art of forensics, with using tools such as Wireshark to dissect packet dumps, as well as hexdump on reading messages. In cryptography, I learned many ways to attack ciphers, as well as creating these ciphers as well. As for web exploitation, there wasn't a
                    <em>
                        whole
                    </em>
                    lot I learned in new skills, but rather an adapted mindset for approaching exploitation of websites and such. It's not much, but it's honest work.
