                    Basically it's a transpiler from goosescript to c++.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Goosescript has only one rule: you cannot use characters from a-zA-Z. Any such characters must be replaced by an H followed by a number of S's corresponding to what character you want (or h and s's for lower case). So for example, if you wanted to write "Abc" it'd be "HShsshsss".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following running it through the transpiler you'll have a c++ file which you can compile with whatever you want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In theory you could use it for other languages too, but I didn't realize that it didn't have anything specific to c++ until after I made the file it outputs end in ".cc" and I'm too lazy to change it.
