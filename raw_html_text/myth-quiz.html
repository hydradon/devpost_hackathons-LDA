                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to enhance learning/education experience while incentivize user to go into local businesses
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Makes learning fun to encourage students to learn via Amazon-Alexa enabled devices.  The question and answer would be dynamic.  If they answered corrected, they would received a special coupon via SMS and direction to the business and therefore drive demand to local businesses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon-Alexa, Nexmo, AWS (Lambda) coding in Node.js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into trouble when we initially build the Nexmo interface using Python while the Game is in Node.js. But that did not work well so we resort to refactored our code using NodeJS to NodeJS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our first time hackathon&rsquo;er / student, who learned a lot about AWS and Nexmo technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had not incorporated SMS into our previous hackathon projects, and we took AWS to a new level.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Myth Quiz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would expand the number of Quiz into different areas and interesting questions to allow richer experiences to excite students using Amazon-Alexa devices.  At the same time make a process to allow easy business sign up to expand options.
