                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neuronetrix COGNISION is a device that will read brain waves and has been used to detect Alzheimer's and ADHD. There was already a desktop application for displaying the data, but this doesn't allow a doctor to easily move around the hospital and check readings of different patients. This project tried to make COGNISION mobile, adding support for iOS and Android. We also wanted to learn about bluetooth, javascript, and mobile app development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reads output from the COGNISION device and displays is neatly on an iOS or Android mobile device. That is what it was supposed to do, however the project did not come together in time for judging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We separated into two clans: network and UI. We decided to use Cordova to develop the app. This allowed us to develop for both Android and iOS at the same time using the same code. One team spent time learning about Bluetooth and trying to connect to COGNISION, the other team spent time learning about UI development and designing the graphs to display the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into initial challenges installing Xamarin so we switched to Cordova
We ran into challenges debugging Bluetooth on the iOS and Android simulator. We learned that simulators don't really handle the phone capabilities well so we would need to deploy to an actual device.
We ran into challenges deploying to iOS but our hero Sam helped us by providing a mac and some tech support. We also learned a lot about remotebuild on Mac and deploying to iOS
We ran into challenges running on iOS because iOS doesn't support the Bluetooth profile of the embedded device we were interfacing with. We also learned what Bluetooth profiles are.
We ran into challenges designing the graphs for the interface, but these only required learning more about JavaScript. We overcame these.
We ran into challenges debugging and developing on Android because it was 3am Sunday morning at this point. We learned about how our poor choice of diet over the preceding 30-hours lead us to this depleted mental state

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First time hackathon for 2 members. Second hackathon for the third member. We are proud of the effort and getting out here to network, practice, resume-build. Things didn't turn out as we would have liked but we still learned a lot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just about everything that was done on this project was done with new knowledge. We had to learn everything we used.

                <p>
                    Its built for Neuronetrix so they can do with the code as they please.
