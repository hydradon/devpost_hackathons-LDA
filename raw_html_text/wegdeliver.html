                    Usually, students only go out for grocery on weekends because they are way too busy on weekdays. But what if I need food for dinner or I just want to eat fruit on weekdays? The solution we come up with is a delivery service for RIT and UR students. You could place your order through our app or website. Then, we will deliver them to your dorm!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a prototype app and a website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our website is now focusing on second-hand item transactions, and our app is about food delivery. We are trying to give users a one-site shopping experience. Now, they are just prototypes but later we will combine those two functionalities. We are just your delivery guy! If you order stuff on our websites, we will delivery them to you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    For some unknown reason, our website could not be accessed by RIT-Guest Wifi but other type of internet works. Check it out!
