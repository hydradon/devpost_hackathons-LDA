                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought NFC was a pretty cool idea and thought it would make it very convenient to basically replace paper business cards
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to enter in your personal information and beam it to other people with the app to store it on their device and easily make calls, send emails, or visit linkedin
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some problems with implementing NFC due to its complexity, and the implementation of multiple activities presented some problems at times as well, as well as updating existing information from a recognized device
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully implemented NFC
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hate android studio
                </p>
