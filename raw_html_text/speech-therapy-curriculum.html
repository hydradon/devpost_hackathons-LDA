                    During the opening ceremony, one of the speakers discussed his work in behavioral therapy and briefly mentioned speech therapy; we contacted him after the speech, and we gave us this idea because he found that speech therapists that he has worked with in the past had a problem with tracking the progress of a student due to the complexity of the curriculum they use.

                    The website is essentially a progress tracker for a very specific speech therapy curriculum. The therapist can add notes, check boxes, and do a few other things to accurately monitor the student's progress. In addition, the teacher can add extra pieces of information and extra tasks to make the curriculum more personalized.
