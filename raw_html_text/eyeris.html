                </h2>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eyeris uses 3 dimensional scans and area learning to find its location. The users' destination will then be represented as dots along the path or beeps within the ear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used project tango's SDK within unity to assist with area learning, motion tracking and augmented reality. In addition we used mesh construction when to create an object that could be exported into additional software.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we programmed the tango to use area learning for navigation however upon testing we found that using the constructor application on the tablet made development simpler. Additionally we had difficulty integrating arduino with unity.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Motion tracking, arduino integration

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group learned how to use project tango and integrate it with hardware such as arduino and software such as Unity. We also furthered our understanding in C#, C++, and electronic circuits.
