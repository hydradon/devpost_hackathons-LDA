                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our valued team member, Madeline Savic, is a double IT/Science student, majoring in genetics. We felt that using her knowledge of genetics would put our team apart from the rest of the competition. We came up with the idea to create a genetic inheritance simulator. It would provide high school students with the tools to explore genetics without the expensive upkeep of live drosophila flies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PXYL Genetics Lab simulates real-life genetics experiments with drosophila flies. Instead of flies however, it crosses Pxys. Pxys are colourful, square-shaped creatures with simple, clear-cut genetics. The user crosses two Pxys, and the program outputs their offspring based on their genotypes. These crosses are all based off real-life genetics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In python, we used Flask to interact with the front end JavaScript. The python code takes the genotypes of the parents and randomly combines them. It selects the correct images for the offspring and sends their URLs back to the front end, where it displays them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are fairly inexperienced in web-based programming, so getting the backend to talk to the frontend took most of our time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The simplistic design of both the Pxys and our logo are aesthetically pleasing and follow a common design. The 'XY' in the middle of our logo and the word 'PXYS' is a good reference to the XY chromosome pair in genetics. The end product was somewhat viable, which was good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to make the front and back end interact. Next time we will try to be familiar with the software we are familiar with. We learnt a bit more of GitHub and how to use it in group assignments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PXYL Genetics Laboratory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand the Laboratory past just the genetic inheritance simulator. We would like to add other simulations that provide high school students with valuable hands-on learning opportunities.
