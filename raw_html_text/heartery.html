                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heart disease accounts for almost 1 out of every 3 deaths. One person dies from it every 40 seconds and the total costs from heart disease are estimated to be $315 billion every year. Many of our families have been influenced by heart disease at some point and through research we found that simply by modifying lifestyle behaviours, we can reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease by 80 percent! Our project then developed out of a goal to encourage people to make better lifestyle choices.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heartery leverages Microsoft Azure's platform by utilizing tools such as Language Understanding and Text to Speech to increase engagement and personalization. Essentially, our service is a chatbot built from Microsoft's LUIS API which extracts medical information from a friendly conversation and considers your likelihood of developing heart disease in the future. It gives personalized tips on how to improve your lifestyle to prevent heart disease in the future and provides you with resources that best match your personal health.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the conversational model using the LUIS API from Microsoft's cloud service, Azure. We linked the endpoint of this model into our react native app for Android, however, this service can also be accessed online, on a web browser.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of our biggest challenges would be from accessing the LUIS endpoint from our react app.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is really glad that we came up with an idea for a project that has such a huge potential impact as heart disease is the number one cause of death in many countries in the world, including the US.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team learned a lot about using the Azure platform and we had lot's of fun discovering the wide variety of services available on it! Along with this, we learned a ton about back-end development and front-end development with React Native.
                </p>

                    What's next for Heartery
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next steps for this project would be to commercialize it by providing a more seamless user interface and including ease-of-use features such as text to speech and speech to text. We also plan on developing integrations with various platforms such as Google Fit, Apple Health Kit, and Samsung Health, as well as develop applications for smart fitness trackers that can provide valuable sensor data.
