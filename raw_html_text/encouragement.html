                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Seeing how some of my friends lacked encouragement and gave up on projects half way through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app displays encouraging words every time you press the start button.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used unity and c#, I used random.range to generate a random number between 1 and 10 and that number would then determine what string would be used.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not being able to figure out how to have it loop and delay so that no button is needed
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I programed my first app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I am not anywhere near a decent programmer with c#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Encouragement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New words of encouragement, more interactions within the background, and better looking background.
                </p>
