                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The death of our lord and savior Harambe, and the scary face of Hurricane Matthew.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a playable game where you, as our savior Harambe attempt to save Florida from Hurricane Matthew while trying to stay away from Hurricane Matthew and collect some bananas.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Processing to make the gui elements simple to work with
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting sound to work and stop the game once Harambe succumbs to the storm presented interesting challenges.
                </p>

                    I'm proud of how good the images look, and how it will honor Harambe.

                <p>
                    I learned the changes from processing 2 to 3, as well as how to use sound, images, and loop manipulation.
