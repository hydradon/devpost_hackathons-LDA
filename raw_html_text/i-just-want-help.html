                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students, we often encounter difficulties in classes when it comes to understanding material and completing assignments. We wanted to create an app that would help connect students with others who have knowledge in concepts they are trying to understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HelpMe helps students find others within their proximity who have the necessary expertise to help students grasp concepts they are learning but may not yet fully understand. The app uses the Google Maps API to find tutors for the student. Tutors must have an account in the app, and so must the student. Students can make instant calls to access tutors, and can then video chat over the app or arrange a meeting in person. Tutors can indicate the price they are willing to pay to help answer a student's question, and students can consult multiple tutors through the app. A rating system helps students pinpoint tutors who may be more effective for their learning style.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had experience with Android Studio prior to this project, so building this app was a tough learning experience. While learning how to use the programming software was tough, we also had difficulties implementing the Google Maps API.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us learned A LOT about programming with Android Studio through this project. We didn't know how to create anything with Android Studio when we started, and even though out app is currently still unfinished, we are amazed that we were still able to implement some functional components. We learned a lot about designing a user-friendly mobile interface.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to fully implement the Google Maps API, develop learning categories and tags so that tutors can pinpoint their areas of expertise and students can receive answers more efficiently. We also want to create a monetary exchange system so tutors can get paid for their work.
