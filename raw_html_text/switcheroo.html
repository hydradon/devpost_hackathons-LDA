                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with the idea for Switcheroo because we wanted to create an affordable home automation solution that doesn't rely on expensive smart outlets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Switcheroo is an app that allows the user to wirelessly control their home appliances from their smartphone. The user can make channels on the app, which maps to individual relays. They can then toggle the devices that are connected to the relay on and off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this system by creating an Android app on Android-Studios, which connects via bluetooth to a relay system. The bluetooth module allows the user to send control signals to an Arduino Mega, which then controls the relays. The relay was then wired up to a GFCI output, allowing for the control of household appliances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge that we ran into was making the app connect to the bluetooth module.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our proudest accomplishment is making an easy to use app, that can intuitively communicate with external hardware.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how use electrical, relays, bluetooth technology, and android studios.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Switcheroo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we plan to refine our application by adding accounts, which will allow the user to save their channels. 
We also are going to design a more commercial hardware apparatus that will make setup easier.
