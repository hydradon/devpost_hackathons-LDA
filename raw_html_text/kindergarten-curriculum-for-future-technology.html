                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used a template, and tried to build individual lesson plans that went from analog, to digital, to computational thinking

                <p>
                    The hardest lessons for a kindergartner were the computational thinking problems

                <p>
                    The thought process of developing a basic understanding of technology, from analog to computational thinking
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
