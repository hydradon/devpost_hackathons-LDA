                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally inspired by the idea of making a Tinder for dogs, later inspired by UCSD Free n for Sale 2.0. We really wanted to target communities and encourage growth and support within and between communities, and through an initial struggle of discovering our true passions, we landed on engaging communities through the power of shared treasures and hobbies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a unique and innovative platform for interacting with people in ways that people don't usually experience and be able to share things that are unique to their own lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core of the app is built on Firebase, and we utilized version control through GitHub. We used multiple web technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and various packages and libraries to pull it all together. Of course, we also put in our hard work and sleepless nights.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our biggest challenge was learning how to deal with Firestore, as we had more experience with SQL databases before. It was challenging to learn the interactions between the front- and back-end. Paired with the asynchrony of JavaScript, it was a huge obstacle for us to be able to read, write, update, and communicate to the database in real time to provide a quality experience to our users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of the fact that we were able to learn how to use Firebase and its storage and database capabilities extensively. We had a great time developing this together and learning efficient debugging strategies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firestore is not the same as Firebase, and it's hard to work when the WiFi sucks.
                </p>
