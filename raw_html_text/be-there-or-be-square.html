                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To motivate ourselves and others to consistently go to their classes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Be There or Be Square allows users to create an account, upload their class schedule, and join a group with their friends. Once in a group you are able to see each person's schedule and the goal is to use competition between group members to motivate each other to attend all of their classes for the week. If you do not attend a class, then you now owe $2 (or another amount decided upon by the group) to the collective group pot of money. Whichever group member attends the most classes by the end of the week, collects the group pot of money as a reward.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to build an Android app to create this project, and we used Android Studio to build it. We also had the assistance of a few APIs in order to include certain features. Mainly we used Firebase for the user sign in or create an account process. We also used Android Calendar View to attempt to create calendar schedules for each user, and we looked into different location services APIs and map APIs to check if users were in the correct location of their class.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As this was the first time working with Android Studio and developing an app for each member of our team, we faced a lot of challenges in the beginning as to getting familiar with Android Studio and the overall process of designing an app. We also faced many challenges incorporating the Google Calendar API, and ended up developing our own calendar pages for the app instead. Firebase also presented many challenges when we first tried to incorporate it into our sign in page, and it took us a long time before we were able to successfully add new users to our database.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite the fact that we were not able to complete the functionality of all components of our project, we all felt that we learned a great deal about Android app development and have gained key skills that will help us a lot in our next projects. We are proud of what we managed to accomplish in our app, and that we managed to successfully use a couple different APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Android app development and Android Studio.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Be there or Be Square
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing the Calendar page and adding location services to the app. We would also like to eventually use the WePay API to add the money distribution directly to the app.
