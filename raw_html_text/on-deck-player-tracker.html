                    Missing favorite player (or your fantasy sports players!) batting when you are busy or watching multiple events is no fun. Stop missing the action.

                    How we built it

                    API from SportRadar for figuring out who is the on-deck batter and other game context.
Twilio for message delivery - and signup!

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Can't use simulator on SportRadar since early game was canceled. Our app particular sensitive to having live data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twilio API worked great, but messages not being delivered since AT&amp;T decided we were spammers.
