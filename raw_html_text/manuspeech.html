                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    <li>
                        Main inspiration:
                        <strong>
                            Accessibility
                        </strong>
                        - to provide disabled people, especially the visually challenged, with the ability to be able to receive messages even with their impairment.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is especially important in the learning environment in promoting academic success.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prescriptions written by doctors can also be useful in this aspect, which has potential to help reduce walk-in waiting times.

                    What it does

                    <li>
                        In a nutshell, this app allows the user to take a snapshot of a particular image that contains text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It then parses it to a string text file, which in turn would turn it to speech.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The app will have a collection of past images that have been converted to speech, for future reference.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We first built an interface, which includes a floating action button that allows the user to take a snapshot of the image which contains text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We then fed this image file to Microsoft Azure API to parse it into text file.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This text file, we then fed this to the text-speech feature of the IBM-Watson to convert it into speech.
                    </li>
                </ol>
