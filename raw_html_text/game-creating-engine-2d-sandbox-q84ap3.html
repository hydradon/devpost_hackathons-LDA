                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the famous game Minecraft, we want to create a game engine that allows users to design their own map instead of using existing ones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a 2D sandbox that allows the users to set up the map for their unique game experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use Codeskulptor, an online Python programming environment to grant users the access to interact with its interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a freshman team, we still have so much to learn. We should make use of our time in college to study the use of API and more programming languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project takes full advantage of the "User Interface" characteristic of Simplegui module in Codeskulptor to provide a DIY experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We should pay more attention to the type of value (integer or float) at the boundary (for example, the edge of cube).
                </p>

                    What's next for Game Creating Engine --- 2D Sandbox
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Self-design the size of map, the background yourself, and choose from more types of blocks... Add more elements to strengthen the core feature of our project --- Creative!
