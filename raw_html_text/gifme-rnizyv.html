                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by products that allowed people to communicate in a covert way.  For example, the super bowl app which shower a domestic abuse victim makes a phone call to the police under the premise she was ordering pizza. We decided that we could use gifs to give people a way to potentially send information that is common but could potentially help those in need.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gifme generates a key for each user which is encrypted in a gif when they send their first message. It can then take in a gif and a message, encrypt the message and then encode the message into the gif and return a link to the updated gif which can be sent to friends.  It does this by changing specified pixels in the first frame of the gif that go unnoticed when changed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using Chrome extensions, Javascript, Azure, Node.js, Express, Linux, C, C++, others
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Issues deciding how to encrypt the messages, how to save and return gifs, making rest calls to get the information from the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of our idea and our ability to make a usable product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there are many choices for hosting servers and databases and some suited our plans better than others.  We learned a lot about APIs and Rest calls.
