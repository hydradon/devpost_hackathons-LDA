                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have seen the impact of specific websites such as Coursera and Khan Academy in democratising education. We believe that people should have the ability to create their own education, and also to share their knowledge to other people. That's why we created the HackingEDUtube, a platform for people to share their knowledge and learn from their peers.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HackingEDUtube allows people to submit courses with their youtube videos and allow other people to view it. The instructor can include individual class notes for each of the lectures, while the students can engage in discussions in the individual lectures. Progress of students will be tracked and displayed in the dashboard.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end is built on bootstrap and javascript. The backend is built on node.js and express.js.
