                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most clickers such as the famous Cookie Clicker had a huge flaw. It was fun at the beginning, but it gets boring because it is the same game over and over again.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to stop clicking at any time to do a minigame so that users wont get bored so easily.

                    Many bugs,errors, and difficulties. 2 minutes before 6:45 I ran into another bug(which magically fixed itself).

                    Finding out how to use local storage was exciting but time consuming, but totally worth it. I am proud to learn local storage after stressing out for 2 hours.
