                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today, most Americans use subscription services on a day-to-day basis throughout their lives. However, there is currently no easy way to manage these services in one place. In order to cancel a subscription you have to remember it, but since most credit card companies don't inform you of monthly charges or you have to go directly through their website to track down these charges, most people don't even know that they are being charged. As a result, we sought a solution that would allow people to manage and cancel their subscription services in one place.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a credit card with the specific intention of managing these subscriptions and allowing you to cancel them at any time. The credit card user can log in to our website to manage and cancel their subscriptions by clicking the cancel buttons. In addition, the website will warn the user before a monthly fee is charged. Also, users can create their own credit cards by filling in their information.

                <p>
                    In the future, we want to expand Subscription Card to function as an actual credit card. We also want easier forms of accessibility for all users and potential integration with existing credit cards. We would also like to improve the U.I to enhance the user experience. Additionally, we would like send automated text messages to notify users that a monthly subscription fee was upcoming.
