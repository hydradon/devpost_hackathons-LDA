                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nobody likes wearing gadgets or stomping on mats to play a dance game! Why can't you just... dance?

                <p>
                    We compare your body movements with YouTube dance videos and score you on your performance! The closer you can follow the dancers, the better you're rated.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the latest and greatest body tracking software, openpose, we capture data from online videos and from the live camera. Then using comparison algorithms, our back-end will give you more points based on how small the delta is.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a web-sided UI was a challenge when it came to exporting highly unstable camera data. Eventually we decided to use OpenCV to create a simple interface.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to implement cutting edge machine learning was certainly no easy feat for a 36-hour hackathon. As well, being able to pull

                    YouTube video and have it ready for dancing in less than a minute is pretty nifty!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our members learned a wide array of libraries including three.js, tfopenpose and many others.

                    You'll probably find us dancing with a computer in a dark room somewhere.
