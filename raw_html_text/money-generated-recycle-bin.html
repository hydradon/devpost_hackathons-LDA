                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> Recent destructive typhoon has reminded us about the importance of climate and preserving environment. This destruction urge us to think how we can actually improve the recycle process of a state and recycle habit of individual.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>The bin will read waste bar code to classify its material for recycle. Afterward, with different type and amount of recycle material, user will be award money into their EZ-link card
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> The hardware part:
                        The bin frame was built by wood and bin container was built by cardboard. We use bar code sensor as sensor to control servo and using RFID sensor to read and write EZ-link card. Beside, we use LCD display, LED bulb and button as user interface component. User can see the process through the LED and LCD display and can interact the machine using button. All these component are controlled by 1 Raspberry Pi
 The software part:
 Code are written in Python with extensive library for hardware component. The software take user from insert card to scan recycle item for reward and terminate by adding money into their EZ-link card.
</code></pre>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We first intend to use bank card to add credit but realize that most bank has their own distinct online transaction 
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    banking. Hence we go to use something more general monetary without any involvement of bank card such as EZ-link.
   Since our project is combine between both software and hardware. But the software part only can work when hardware is established. Challenging by this, we have to use fast prototype for electronic circuit through bread board before directly connect as a product
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We able to  combine both hardware and software into one single and completed machine.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We have learn much better on how to process a team that build product based on both hardware and software. Beside, it help us understand the sensor and python much better when we integrate them

                    What's next for Money generated recycle bin
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Money generated recycle bin will continue to complete it material based sorting feature and cooperate with SMRT for access to EZ-link card payment system. Our ultimate goal is to make recycle hassle free and addictive.
