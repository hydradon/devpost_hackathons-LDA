                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dark Souls, Pokemon Go, and Geo Caching are all location-based models that we've based our designs on. Our main goal is to give users a unique way to exchange information and value with one another in a fun, interactive way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TerraDrop allows users to create drops in specific locations marked by GPS which can then be found by other users or friends. In addition to holding messages, drops can also hold cryptocurrency via Ethereum smart contracts. This gives users a strong incentive to find drops which can be utilized by local businesses to increase traffic to their place of business. Businesses could also use our premium services to create their own cryptocurrency that would be compatible with TerraDrop and give customers access to select discounts and rewards.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the the application on iOS and Android with drops being stored and served from a server. We also wrote smart contracts on Ethereum for holding and issuing cryptocurrency to users that find a drop.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting an application working on both iOS and Android that can track drops in real time. In order to track those drops, we built an HTTPServer that interacts with a MySQL database and responds to requests with JSON encoded data. We're also very proud to have a working cryptocurrency feature that showcases a strong use case of blockchain to exchange value in a trusted and secure manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned a lot about developing on the Android and iOS platforms and the current limitations of blockchain technologies such as Ethereum.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TerraDrop
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to add more social networking features such as adding friends and tracking their drops. We'd also like to add  a cryptocurrency wallet to the mobile applications directly as the user currently needs to go through a browser to claim cryptocurrency from a drop.
