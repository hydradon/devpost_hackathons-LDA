                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people forget about their medications and tend to miss them. Also, they do not know about the kind of medication they are in and have no idea if what they are taking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app analyzes the prescription bottle and changes it into text, giving out its information and setting reminders.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the back end using Flask and used Microsoft cognitive services api to analyze the picture. The details received from the picture were then sent to the health APIs to get more information about their usage. We used Java to build the android app and swift to build an ios app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding proper data to compare the drug details received from the pictures.
                </p>
