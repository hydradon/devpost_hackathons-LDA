                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Receiving a paper at the door and stopping there to check in is what motivated me.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hit a lot of bumps and couldn't completely finish it, but I meat it to be as a crowd controlling app which could also work as understanding the crowd.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with firebase was tough since it was my first time in doing so.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would definitely say that I have a better understanding of working with firebase and xcode.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I cannot function well on no sleep and that xcode can be surprisingly buggy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for passport
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to build the other half of passport, which is the passport scanner. It will be the app that scans the barcode from passport and helps people manage events.
