                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are sick and tired of waiting in extreme weather every morning for the school bus. So we created an app that tells us when the bus is right outside so that we can head out at the right time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows the location of a bus relevant to your position and will notify you when the bus is five minutes away.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MIT app inventor to create an app on our android phone.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We struggled to show a line which modifies as the bus location gets closer to the student's location. 
We struggled with getting all the components of the code to work properly together.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Creating an app that can benefit high school students and school districts. Being able to show locations on a map. Correctly notifying when the bus is close.

                    What's next for BUSted
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on creating other notifications that the driver can input, showing if the bus is late for some reason or if the bus is not coming today. We also plan on creating accounts for districts so that the district has the option to edit and see all bus routes. The district should also be able to send out its own notifications.
