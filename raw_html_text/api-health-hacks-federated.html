                    In 1966, etoposide was approved as the primary drug for small cell lung cancer treatment. 50 years later, a study revealed that the drug severely compromised the immune systems of 92% of Japanese patients. That statistic was only 66% in Caucasian populations, on whom the drug was initially tested. Had the data on Japanese populations been released for research sooner, countless deaths could have been prevented.

                    It&rsquo;s time we start sharing.

                    Currently, privacy concerns prohibit patient data sharing across hospitals. Using machine learning, we&rsquo;ve built a platform to democratize access to global medical data, while keeping patient medical information private.

                    In our implementation of federated learning, each hospital trains a model on data from their patient populations
The updates from those versions are aggregated to form a powerful model that leverages insights from a diverse range of patient data

                    We're breaking down data silos to enable medical breakthroughs with global relevance.
