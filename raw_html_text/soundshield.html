                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Noisey neighbours partying next door? Have you ever been woken up by your roommates alarm? someone watching TV whilst you are trying to study. Maybe your bedroom just happens to be on a noisey road or under a flightpath. Protect yourself from the ever growing hustle and bustle of the city life by creating your peaceful and quiet space
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sound shield protects from unwanted noise by generating the antisound equivalent to what is being heard, this process involves destructive interference, whereby opposite waves in phase will ahnilate each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It involves a microphone listening for the ambient sound, real-time signal processing and a speaker.
The speaker produces antisound as a part of the active noise control.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Microcontroller that i chose was incapabable, of Pulse width modulating at a speed which could reproduce a large enough spectrum of sound. Later the phase was out of alignment 150ms.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having learnt that the first approach i took was not going to generate a complex enough audio signal, i quickly switched to do the signal processing on a more powerful machine, my laptop, which was able to handle the very high sample rate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learnt how to do signal processing in a windows environment at a high sample rate.

                <p>
                    kickstarter, and perhaps a hardware signal processing circuit.
