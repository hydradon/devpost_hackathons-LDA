                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I remember using Excel for the first time in physics class and wanting to draw fancy equations like on my graphing calculator.  I couldn't do it!  And I didn't have the Excel skills to be able to do it manually... so I wanted to make an Excel Add-in that would make this process extremely easy.  This should be useful for students and teachers alike.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Equation Grapher graphs equations in Excel.  You can graph using x,y-coordinates or polar coordinates.  In addition, you can graph parametric equations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used React-js with Typescript and the Office UI Fabric React components.  I used the yeoman office add-in generator to start the project and edited it using Visual Studio Code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to learn React from scratch as I had no interest learning how to use Angular.js.  In addition, I had to learn how to use all of the node.js idiosyncrasies along with modifying the webpack config files so that I could run a separate webpage for help features.  I had never used node.js before, either.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                    <li>
                        Learning React-js

                    <li>
                        I think my UI looks pretty decent.  I give most of the credit to the Fabric team, since their components look pretty good to begin with.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    React-js :)
Writing an office add-in is pretty simple. The hard part is learning what your constraints are...

                    I'm trying to get it published on the store as a free add-in.
