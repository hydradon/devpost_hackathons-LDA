                    What&rsquo;s wrong with Interpreting now?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine arriving at your doctors appointment only to find out that your Arabic speaking
interpreter has an unrecognizable dialect to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently refugees get interpreters assigned to them based on language but this often 
does not take into account the complexity of language based on dialects and accents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only permanent residents and citizens have access to free (Gov sponsored) interpreter 
services.  And un-accredited interpreters formal options to offer their services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interpreter services are inflexible, expensive, and inaccessible to refugees unless 
assisted by agencies like the Red Cross.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The existing framework of matching refugees to interpreters is inefficient and
surprisingly problematic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's missing?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What&rsquo;s missing in the industry is an online web platform that 
connects refugees to interpreters, one that also enables un-
accredited interpreters access to work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By harnessing mobile technology one could improve access to these 
language services, and so improve the quality of life of thousands of 
Refugees in their daily lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An accessible marketplace for accredited interpreters and anyone 
speaking a second language would disrupt and grow the existing 
interpreter services industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proposing an open online platform that connects refugees
with interpreters for any aspect of their lives &ndash; a matchmaking marketplace for refugees and interpreters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What do we do &amp; what's next:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We address an obvious and widespread need in the refugee community &ndash; 
improving access to language services that makes a huge impact on their 
everyday lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our platform has the potential to disrupt the existing Interpreter industry
through the incorporation of ubiquitous technology, and simple
innovations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are ready to build out our platform and have identified ale sustainable 
revenue stream.
