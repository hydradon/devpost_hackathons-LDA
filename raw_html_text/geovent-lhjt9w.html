                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we were first trying to get the showers here in the Hackathon, we were a bit lost. We had to Google the website, get the address, and search for it on Google Maps. We thought that this process was tedious and that something could be done to make it better. We came up with the idea for a geo-location based social media platform where you would have different types of "Events" that take place in different and precise geographical locations. 
We've also wanted to preserve privacy and so we made a "Private" type of event where only a certain radius would be able to see an event. (Examples: Only people staying in the Hackathon building will be able to see where the showers are)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app integrates the Google Maps API with an "Event Creating" functionality that would mark certain locations on the map.
The types of "Events" are:
Social Event, Private Event (radius-limited), Corporate (for- and non-profit), Business (mainly for advertising), PSA (By Governmental Bodies only and radius-limited), Warning (radius-limited, by the community, search, upvote, and reputation systems)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java in Android Studio to program our app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we faced when programming is that nobody on the team, prior to the competition, had any useful knowledge on how to program in Android studio.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that we've been able to facilitate the process of event creating and event organizing. We also made it more reliable to invite people.

                    Monetization. More in-depth features, ability to predict traffic.
