                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity is an amazing framework and tool used to make 3D experiences, and the ability to choose a framework on the cutting edge of Virtual Reality Technology, was too tantalizing not to take. We were also inspired by the simplicity and beauty of problems such as the 3-Body problem in physics and similar physics related knowledge which would seem very intuitive if we had the ability to play and interact with them directly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In our project, you are spawned into a classroom environment and see a spinning cube that acts as a marker for an area that teleports you to the orbit simulation. You then can watch how the gravity affects the bodies and look at their trail.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with one simulation and built around that and worried about VR implementation at the end.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VR implementation was not successful simply due to the fact that none of us knew how to do so, and the process is quite lengthy when that is the case. Our introduction to Unity was also slow with most of us being clueless, but eventually that issue subsided somewhat.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned a good deal more about how Unity works and is structured,and this is our first group project created together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned that you are able to use pre-made objects and effects from other people in Unity and we grew an understanding of how Unity children objects act in relation with their parent objects. We also learned about the many 3d function callse within Unity.

                    What's next for BrightSparkVR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was intended to have multiple locations that could be visited by using the classroom as a hub area. Each area would represent a different physics simulation with alterable parts. The VR aspect would allow for better examination of these processes and physical manipulation of position and velocity.
