                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I didn't get to grow up with my parents so what if I can have a bigger role in their lives by sending them animated drawings I made as a kid?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, only sends snapshots of the pictures to parents; however, once Lottie can fix a pod conflict it can send animations too!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Swift, RxSwift
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    RxSwift is rough. Swift drawing is rough. Distinguishing separate "characters" was rough.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    App is fully set up and complete and can easily be done with animation. I have the json ready to do the animation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cool animations and drawing on swift.
                </p>
