                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well y'know, we were sittin' around watching a movie and thought, what could possibly be better than some pizza? But of course, some people don't like olives, and some people don't like animals.
What could be better than a website that creates the perfect pizza order for you and your friends, or a weekly meeting, or a family reunion?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The group leader creates a pizza session, and sends the unique URL to their friends. The friends each input the number of slices they'd like, their three favorite toppings, and one veto. Plus whether they're vegetarian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After they've completed it, the group leader visits his private URL and gets the report!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python!
Flask!
Javascript!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at us go!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Normally I'd use Ruby for something like this because it's nice programming in a language that couldn't care less what kind hacky solution you came up with, but Python seemed like a good compromise for our team. And compromise is what ordering pizza is all about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Turns out the algorithm to generate your perfect pizza is hard! It's not just sort of hard, it was really hard!
Really hard!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, domains take longer to propagate than either of us had realized. Probably something to think about for the future, when we next have a chance to use pizzapizzapizzapizzapizza.com (that's five times the pizza!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After deleting half the non-working pizza fitting algorithm in a blind rage, it started working! Now that's what I call agile engineering practices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sleep is good! I got like 6 or 7 hours of it! Also, thinking you're smart for commenting spaghetti code at 3 in the morning is not a real thing. The comments all read "HERE'S THE PIZZA!"
                </p>

                <p>
