                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired through our experiences of being minorities in a STEM field.
We want females in the stem field, especially computer science, to feel empowered by the accomplishments of others who are like them, so they know they are capable of achieving great things!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take a picture of yourself, upload it, and you'll see what woman in stem you look like and learn about their achievements!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used python and TensorFlow for Poets to retrain the model using images of WIS and compare the uploaded image.
We used Google App Engine to host our website.
We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create the structure and style of the website.
We used flask as a framework for our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we struggled to host the website and link our application to our Python code.
We also struggled with storing uploaded images into the Google Cloud Bucket.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used technologies new to all of us, including TensorFlow for Poets, Flask, and Google Cloud Platform.
We used machine learning for the first time. We were also able to have functionality and were able to create our minimum viable product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use TensorFlow for machine learning, Flask to implement our application, and Google Cloud Platform to host our website. We learned how to use Google Storage buckets to store the images uploaded on the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for empowHER
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to allow the user to take a picture through their device, increase the dataset, and create a domain.
We also hope to improve the user interface.
