                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the world-changing idea proposed by the gods of YX to create a virtual-haptic-machine-learning-artificial-intelligence closet of synergy.

                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The plan was to create an Android app for use by store employees and customers to add items of clothing to a store's catalogue or a personal closet respectively. This would be achieved by using image processing in Google Cloud to identify a picture of the clothing item as either headware, bodyware, legware, footware or Harambe. This data would then be accessed in store at a terminal where the user can browse the store catalogue as well as their personal closet to find new outfits made up of items of their own clothing and clothing in-store.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interface for the terminal was planned to use a LeapMotion and a haptic board to provide an immersive user experience.
