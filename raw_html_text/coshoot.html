                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rarely is a professional piece of cinematography filmed from a single point of view. Why should yours? Our team wanted to help friends and family shoot events with the same flexibility that comes with a multi-camera setup. 5G is incredibly important to the performance of the application as latency is the greatest threat to cutting out someone's favorite moment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Link your devices, start a Co-Shoot, and let the app know when you think you have the best view. The app will sync together all of the best angles from every device into a single video. Imagine that you are inside the party and your friends are outside - shoot different views. Imagine you are near the goal line and your friend is midfield - shoot different views. Imagine you are tall and your friend is vertically challenged - the world looks different and great from both places. Create a shoot, join a shoot, share the shoot on social media with multi-camera angled video in three clicks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Co-Shoot is built with React Native and Expo for the frontend and Node/Express in the backend. Using google cloud and firebase for storage, FFMPEG for video editing. The core of the app is implemented in socket.io for instant by-directional communication from client to server. Finally the landing page is written Wix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we had wanted to live stream the currently focused device to every other user but were unable to do so due to a limitation in Expo. In addition, it was our first time working with FFMPEG and we struggled to learn the ins and outs of a new tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to submit a cohesive, complete product while maintaining base minimum levels of tranquility amongst members of the team. We are also proud of being able to come up with an idea that has such great potential for reach in the real world.
                </p>

                    What's next for Co-Shoot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to eventually detach from Expo in order to bring live streaming capabilities to the app. In addition, the app could improve by integrating many of the social features found in todays social media streaming platforms like Youtube, Instagram, and Snapchat.
