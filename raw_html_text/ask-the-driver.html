                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We travel a lot as a family and we often spend a lot of time in a car. Our kids love asking us "are we there yet?!" every few minutes when they bored. This is how idea of building Alexa skills to help us came about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes care of answering classic road trip question: "Are there yet?!"
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AWS provided Node.JS blueprints for Alexa Skills and we built on top of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build large enough database of good answers. It was fun :)
                </p>
                <h2>

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how Alexa works and learned a bit of Node.JS as well as AWS Lambda.

                    More interactive, more questions, more answers, more fun! We planning to add artificial intelligence to teach driver on how to answer most popular questions.
