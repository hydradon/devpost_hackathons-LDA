                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Samy Kamkar (samy.pl) is an amazing security researcher. He used a Teensy to prove how easy it is to hack anything. A Teensy device is quite expensive and not a common piece of hardware. So we decided to turn an ordinary Arduino Uno into a malicious pwnDuino to prove how easy it is to hack anyone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The client-side Python script images your Arduino Uno into a malicious pwnDuino. From there, you will be able to plug that pwnDuino into any computer, automatically pwning it. It will download a malicious VBscript payload that enables us to conduct malicious activities on the compromised computer, as well as establish a persistent connection to the computer through the pwnDuino app, available on Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Android Studio and Atom.io to built the entire framework. Code for the Arduino was written in Arduino IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compiling the code was lways problematic, as the malicious pwnDuino malfunctioned a bit, especially when attacking our dummy Windows computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to build an entire framework (still WIP however) in 12 hours. We felt that this would be a great Poc for the hacker community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hardware-software interactions are usually difficult to control, and writing code that translates from the computer to the hardware can often be problematic
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for pwnduino
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Writing a legitimate VBscript payload that can cause mayhem on a suppose-target computer.
