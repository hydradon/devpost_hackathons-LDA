                    A common problem is for people to forget about when food they bought expires. On a large scale, such as at food pantries, this is a huge loss. This app was created to fix that issue by notifying the user when their food is about to expire. We anticipate that our app will suggest recipes to the user with the ingredients that are available currently.
