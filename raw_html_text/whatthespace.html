                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to improve education through VR and decided to design a platform for VR lessons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are very expensive, we designed around the assumption that the teacher would use the headset to conduct the lesson and students would use low-cost mobile VR to view the lesson.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the prototype, we decided on a tour of the Solar System along with a quiz component for the mobile client.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The teacher is able to bring all clients(students) to different points in the Solar System. The clients are able to answer a quiz through gaze tracking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game is hosted on a desktop equipped with an Oculus Rift headset. The mobile client joins this host on the local WiFi network. The host is then able to bring the mobile client to different points in the Solar System.
                </p>

                        Documentation for the networking was not very good, but once it works it is very easy to set up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Long build times especially on less powerful Mac hardware to deploy to mobile.

                    It looks really good :)
We are able to easily connect students and teachers together through Unreal's networking Blueprints.

                    The Unreal Blueprint visual programming system.
Designing an interactive VR multiplayer prototype.
Making materials, textures and lighting to make our 3D models look good.
