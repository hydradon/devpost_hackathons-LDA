                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of people create multiple playlists on music apps such as Spotify, according to their various moods. The weather seems to influence the moods of individuals and in turn, their musical choices. We thought of optimizing the process of choosing playlists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web app automatically suggests a playlist depending on the weather in the location the user specifies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having previous experience with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, we thought that creating a web app would be the simplest way to work around our idea as it also an easy to read interface for the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we faced was to improve upon our basic idea of the model. Implementing Google's cloud vision API, weather API and the Spotify API were our first few ideas. However, they were very difficult to execute within the time constraints of the hackathon.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With this being our first ever hackathon, it was a huge learning experience. Collaborating as a team, we did our best to delegate the workload between us equally. From a technical point of view, we learnt a lot about API's and mobile app development with android studio and hope to integrate them in our future projects.
