                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <h1>
                    servizurich wanted to reduce accidents while #thoughtworks wanted to help the city. This inspired me to examine the reasons for accidents in my city/ country due to technology. The main reason for distraction via technology and people taking videos while they drive. This is dangerous since their attention is not on the road and can cause traffic build up or worse accidents.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    So I wanted to build an app which reduced distractions while on the road. The came up with two main concepts which could be combined into one but all start with pressing a button in an app when you get into your car. This then turns your phone into a mode where it automatically disconnects calls but sends a message to the sender that you are driving. Since people have to turn on their camera to take videos as they drive, i realised its safer if they ask the camera to record and it is ready to take a video and it turns off without people needing to physically multitask.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    did not have time to get a working model, even simplified versions of the app needed a lot of research and since the way methods would act were interconnected it was difficult to program without fully identifying all their roles.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tried using onCannedTextResponsesLoaded, reject and TelephonyManager. Think I might've found a way to make it partially work but do not have time to implement it.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emulator would not work and could not fix the problem so could only test on real phone.Trying to remember/learn how to program in Android studio while trying to figure out what each method and class needed in order to function without in depth documentation and how they will all interact with one another.

                    Researching in depth that I found quite a few methods and classes to accomplish the tasks at hand.
