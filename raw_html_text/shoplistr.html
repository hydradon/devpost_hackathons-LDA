                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind are idea was that one of our team members forgot to purchase a milk carton for their mother. To reduce forgetfulness of shopping needs, such as milk, we decided to create an android app called SHOPLISTR.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through typing items needed for shopping on the android app, the app creates a list for the user to look to. The main feature of our app is that when the user types an item they need, the app shows them the nearest location with the item. This is a convenient and an efficient method to find all your shopping items without transporting to various stores only to see that the item is not there.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Android Studio, Google Cloud Console and Java, we built the app.
