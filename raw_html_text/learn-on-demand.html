                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The gig economy, applications like Uber, Airbnb etc. and working as a Private Tutor is my clients having a set meeting and not having questions then but having issues later. The ability to see what students need help when I'm available would empower me and the students to get/give help when they need it, not just at a set weekly time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now it is just a home page, log in, sign up page and a concept. As a final project, it would allow students to sign up and connect with private tutors when they need them and organize on-campus locations to meet them and finish the work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Muse an Adobe application that streamlines the HTML creation process, was used to make the master page where formatting came from, and then it linked the four different pages together. Some of the login pages were coded separately on just HTML and then ported into the Muse files. The website is hosted locally right now through mongo database, in the future, it would be hosted on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the creation of the website on Muse, we ran into issues with the creation of buttons and interactive systems that look nice. Creating the database using Mongoose, which was later realized to be a bad idea, then we switched to MongoDB which wasn't completed in time for the deadline.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting different pages connected and set it up to be hosted locally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned

                <p>
                    How to put together a good concept and nuances of social/service network websites.
