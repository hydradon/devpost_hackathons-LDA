                <p>
                    When you have a server running API code it can be tough to make sure that your API is still working. Enter heartbeat. Heartbeat is a web UI that automatically HTTP GETs your API in order to ascertain whether the API is still alive. The time period per GET request is completely customizable by the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Heartbeat sends HTTP GET requests to your API on a specific time period to constantly ascertain whether the API is still alive.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting used to the new Rails 5 Active Jobs request was a hassle, especially with recursive jobs. Also this was my first experience with both ruby and ruby on rails so getting used to the convention over configuration lifestyle was very difficult for me
