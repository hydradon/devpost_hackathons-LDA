                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to play Guitar Hero with a twist. Now, you can!

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users are able to record music from different instruments using body movements similar to play that instrument.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it's built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Airstrument is built through a web application created with bootstrap, for responsive design, php and javascript scripting, and css for animation and styles. The application is connected to two accelerometers on an arduino that records user movements onto a text file. The text file connects to the user's computer through Wi-Fi. We're able to ready the movements to display which cords the user is playing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How does one hack for a web application without internet? 
We were originally planning to use the leap motion and image processing to detect movements and turn them into sounds.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have taken on a new challenge without the use of the internet/

                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we really need wi-fi. In addition, we learned to achieve more through teamwork and knowledge sharing. We had several critical design changes that were fueled by creative brainstorming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for airstrument
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next up, we have to configure our app to a r-pi touch screen. Thus, the application will be fully mobile. You can play air guitar anytime, anywair.
