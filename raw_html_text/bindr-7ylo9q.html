                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've been in 8.01 for a week now and have yet to find friends/study buddies to do our p-sets with, so we thought we'd make an app to help students find others in their classes to study/do hw with! Since we wanted students to be able to easily transition from the world of dating to the world of academia, we tried to make our app a tinder/grindr clone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    (Ideally) you and a classmate match for a given class, then you get together to do some problem sets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask &amp; React-Native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Half of our team was completely unfamiliar with both flask and react, but we taught each other as much as we could (and went through
                    <em>
                        numerous
                    </em>
                    online tutorials).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We (the two less accomplished computer scientists) learned a lot about writing locally hosted webservers using flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bindr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll try to implement a UI similar to that of tinder/grindr (the distinctive "swipe left"/"swipe right").
