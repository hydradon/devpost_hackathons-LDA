                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted to display the technology of 3D audio. Developed a 3D audio-tracking VR experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our system generates enemies randomly or with a camera input system. These enemies will fire projectiles at a target. The player is able to use 3D audio to locate where these projectiles are. The player has a shield in front of them, thus by turning around, the player is able to block the projectiles. A score is kept and 5 lives are granted upon the start of each game. A game is started by looking down at the ground.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the system using Unity, Google Cardboard, OSC, and Open CV for Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges with integration of individual components. We originally had an Oculus Rift but were unable to use it due to hardware limitations of our computers. We also planned to have a physical gun shoot the enemy cups.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have finished a final product that works. It is polished, easy to use, and fun. It demonstrates the power of 3D audio in an effective manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Development in Unity, OSC protocol, and system integration fundamental components.

                    What's next for Shoot Stuff
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continued work in making the full integration.
