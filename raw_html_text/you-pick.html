                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project comes from living through those times when we wanted picking a restaurant to be a bit easier. We decided that an app is a smart way to have all persons data and compare it to find each person's likes and dislikes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the user's photos stored on their phone and finds all that are classified as food. These photos are then parsed through Clarifai's api to get the most common tags and type of food per picture. Food is classified into some cuisines and the user's food profile is created. Through an embedded map, friends can be invited and compared with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built as a React web application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major issue we ran into was realizing that Google had a lot of privacy settings that we needed to be mindful of.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that in the end, we were able to pull together a final application with features that mainly work together.
