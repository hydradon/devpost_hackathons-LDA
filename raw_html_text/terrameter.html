                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard for most people to measure or quantify growing conditions for plants. This project attempts to gather data for plant growth to make it easier to understand the conditions in which plants will grow, and to understand how different conditions can change over time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Measures and plots soil moisture, temperature, light intensity over time. An LED will light up while soil moisture is considered satisfactory (based on user input).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a variety of sensors on an Arduino which produces a serial output which is read by Python to store into a database. The database is also used to produce the graphs using matplotlib.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of hardware knowledge - we were all very new to using Arduinos and hardware hacks. We spent time on bug fixing an LED that was improperly constructed because we never realized the issue was simply in the construction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to create something that works using an Arduino, and we managed to create visualizations of the data that the Arduino could collect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use an Arduino, and how to connect and interpret various sensors and connect the collected data to software. We also learned how to use simple databases with Python.
                </p>

                    What's next for Terrameter
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An oscillating motor connected to light and sound sensors to measure the height of the plant.
