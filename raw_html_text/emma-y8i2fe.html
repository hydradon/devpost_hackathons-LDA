                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that would give people an anonymous outlet to express their feelings. Sometimes when you're depressed or being bullied you just want someone to talk to without having the fear of being judged. Emma is intended to be understanding, empathetic and knowledgeable about depression and harassment. She will know where to guide you for the best help depending on your situation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emma will talk to you and react to what you're saying in a compassionate and friendly manner. She will pick up on things you say and guide you to the right destination for help if needed or will just continue talking to you for as long as you need to express your feelings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emma
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Waiting for Emma to be published and made public by Facebook so that anyone who needs to have an anonymous conversation is able to do so without having the fear of being judged.
