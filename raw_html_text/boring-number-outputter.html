                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I couldn't decide what to build here and realized that I was already feeling rusty with Java. Rather than struggling through re-picking up Java while also developing an Android app, I decided to just pick one semi-simple project and focus on getting my grasp on Java re-solidified.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Generates the min, max, ascending, and descending orders based on what the user enters
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java using views
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dealing with the frontend/view again because I struggle to remember how to work with the two in Java
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it build and compile even though I started pretty late due to my indecisiveness
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I should try to come to hackathons with a full idea next time so I don't waste so much time trying to figure out how to do something only to end up scrapping that original idea and doing something that's more of practice than a hack.

                <p>
                    Hue will be sleeping and then hopefully not be as indecisive next time around
