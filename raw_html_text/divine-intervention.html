                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After Elton received an email about an overdraft fee from his credit card, our team sought to make it easier to understand and visualize our finances in an intuitive manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Divine Intervention is a Chrome extension that notifies you about the financial impact of making an online purchase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is easy to exceed the credit limit or overdraft a debit card simply out of ignorance. Banks notify you only in the aftermath when they've charged the fees already - a situation that could have been avoided if only you knew about your low balances beforehand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Divine Intervention intervenes every time you're about to overspend. The extension works in the background and provides a timely warning whenever you're about to make a purchase that will exceed any of your financial limits. You can visualize how your balance will be affected by the purchase so that you can always make well-informed purchasing decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On setup, you login to your bank accounts, and we use the Plaid API to access your banking information. That's all - everything is ready. We used Bootstrap for the UI components, JQuery and Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation and local storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used chart.js to generate visualizations of your finances.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble deciding on a project that everyone was excited about working on. 
We switched tracks from Education to Fintech.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some technical challenges we faced was detecting when the user is on a billing page. We tried to use a ML approach, but this was not very effective. Instead, we switched to just scraping the page the user is on and using heuristics to detect if it is a billing page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Divine Intervention works, and it is a product that I would use to learn more about my personal finances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, Divine Intervention has the potential to help people make more informed decisions about their personal finance. It intervenes at a point of action where the user is about to make a mistake - and really helps people to not fall into financial pitfalls that are too subtle and damaging at times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I gained more familiarity with JS, HTML, and CSS.
Additionally, I learned how to map out user experience and add character to applications. 
I also learned about branding and graphic desgin; I designed the logo.
                </p>
