                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought it was a great opportunity to work with friends over night to make a project and learning a new skill.

                <p>
                    Our project informs people how privacies can be invaded in the informational era, and have a mini program that allows user to see how passwords are encrypted in a simple way.

                <p>
                    We had no idea how to build a website, and it was hard to have a innovative idea.

                <p>
                    It's important to divid up work among teammates.
