                    Projection mapping in dynamic fashion in hologram and Mixed reality
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using VIVE and motion capture capacity, and coordination calibration in Unity 3D scene and model.  I project image on a box which on top audience and see the hologram floating in the dark, and see the projection mapping on the wall and the box do dynamic story telling when the sale person  moving and rotating the box in different location and orientation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build a box with some transparent and some opaque windows (could be on demand later)so people can see the real object in the box or see me do thing.  put a VIVE tracker aside to track its location and do 3D model calibration so I can do dynamic projection mapping precisely.  Accord the need, I can design auditory and visual effect when the object in different location
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not have VIVE nor the powerful computer to run it before the contest, so I just bought a new laptop on Fri without enough time to prepare before hand.  on the first day I wasted 2 hr to refresh the firmware update and setup computer and building the physical demo space for 3D tracking, and learn program VIVE w/ Unity and dealt with the disasters that the only VR-ready computer I have die after the 9pm, yet I need to  recover most of the remaining usable project parts ASAP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On man team pulls out the hardware resource nobody believe I can secure it.  Then even  the VR-ready laptop died at the 9pm in the first day,   I did not give up and keep fighting for 13 hr yet can not get any other computers partially work for VIVE.  But I use my time wisely in sleep few hours and then pull out the final physical demonstration stuffs in 2 hours and even come up of a better extension to make it even better next time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned the whole process from setting up a brand new VIVE in a public space in less than 2 hr to set up the whole sotry
                </p>
