                <p>
                    We are an innovative lifestyle-oriented technology provider that aims to raise awareness about the inherent sustainability issues within the food production process. This project allows its users to be more mindful of the impact that they are having on the environment as they consume processed foods. Everything from the production process of the food, the production process of the packaging, the packaging process, all the way to the food waste and the packaging waste has an impact on the environment. It is important that we, as earthrs, are aware of how large an impact we are having on the demise of our home, so as to perhaps slow down the deterioration of earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the great sustainability movement of the present day, Earthr aims to spread further the reach of this movement.

                <p>
                    As we built this project, we faced many challenged putting the puzzle pieces together. We had our stack functioning separately, but had trouble getting the different parts of the stack working together (ie. pulling the data from the MongoDB Atlas to the backend, and then passing the parsed data through to the frontend). Though the aforementioned difficulty was resolved, there was one part of the puzzle that we weren't quite able to master: deploying the project on the cloud, connected to a custom domain.

                    What we learned:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We hadn't had a lot of experience with our stack, and as a result, the entire team learned a lot about how to use the  various tools needed to build a web app.
