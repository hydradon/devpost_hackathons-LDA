                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When somebody asked me to perform a piano piece for them a few months ago, I ran into a classic problem for musicians - the pieces that I had practiced before I forgot because I had not practiced them recently, and the pieces that I was working on currently were not worthy of performance. Repertoire is here to change that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Repertoire is here to change that. You start out by adding all the pieces you should know how to perform into a dynamically created list. After saving, you will receive a notification every day of what piece to practice, randomly chosen from that list. You get points for streaks of completing your practice and you earn a day off for every 5 day streak. By doing all this, you will be practicing one piece randomly chosen from your repertoire every day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built using XML and Java in android studio. Back end storing on the phone is done with XML so that the list of pieces the user inputs persists from one instance of the application to the next.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was the first hackathon for all of our team, we are very proud of what we have accomplished. It was a radically new experience for us and we were able to create something that we never thought we could have done before.
As beginning Android programmers and graphic designers, we are very proud of what we achieved this weekend. Our front end developer learned more about tying user experiences into the backend, while our backend developer learned how to use XMl to save user settings in Android. Our graphic designers leanred to use Adobe Illustrator for the first time and were able to utilize Google's Material Design database to create a mock-up.
