                    Inspiration: When you're playing your favorite racing game, listen to music, watching a movie, or even Call of Duty you find that there's that missing element of feeling that you get from each of these experiences that you'd feel in your chest.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: By sending different frequencies via aux from a device (computer, phone, etc. ) and create surreal "bass" like vibrations into your chest. With the addition of good headphone and a oculus the experience is incredible
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We used mini amplifiers and transducers and modified aux cords and battery packs for the electronic components. By using a vest we found in the Mall and trimmed thin cutting boards to mount all the electronic pieces on the inside. We also made our own straps so you can pull the vest tighter given different body types
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Two of our amps gave out for some unknown reason. We were using them from quite a while and when we mounted them that's when they failed. We tried to trouble shoot and hot wire them into working based on the schematics. They could have given out due to static generated from the vest itself and shorting a key chip on the boards.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We got all of them to work for a period of time and we were able to use them with Project Cars, an oculus, and our own 2DOF simulator to create an incredible, real life experience! It truly felt like you were sitting right in the seat of a Formula 1 racecar on any track in the world!
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: Definitely looking into parts a little bit more for possibly small issues that could cause failure.  How to better read, understand and modify circuits and audio signals. Also that we see another application of using the vibrations as like another language that can be used to reproduce means of communications for those who can't hear.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BeatsVest: Get it working perfectly of course! We know we just have to exchange the amps (maybe with some higher Wattage) and possible set up a blue tooth connection instead of aux cables.
