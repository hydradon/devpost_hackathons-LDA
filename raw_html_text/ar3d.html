                    Inspiration? As students in a design school, we have seen our fair share of building and creation from our projects and hobbies. There are times when 3D modelling become dull and draggy since we will be stuck in one place doing repetitive action for a very long periods of time. There are also times when the limitations of not being not in total control of the process can cause delays and mismatches in timeline and visions. As such, we feel that there is a need to break this routine by introducing AR modelling where you can build anywhere and be truly in control of the technical and creative process by incorporating AR, which we can interact with directly and with minimal setup.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does?  Enhance the experience of 3D modelling for aspiring character designers, builder enthusiast, and 3D modellers by making it more engaging by involving creators in AR building.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it? Creating numerous buttons, markers, and other features in Unity to help create the process of 3D model creation.
