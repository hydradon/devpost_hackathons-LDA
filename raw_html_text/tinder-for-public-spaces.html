                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app was designed for those exploring new cities and trying to familiarize themselves with public spaces in the area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can 
(i) find public places they're interested in by swiping through those existing in the database,
(ii) add more of their favorite spaces to the database for everyone else to access,
(iii) receive notifications when they're within a certain proximity of their saved spaces,
and (iv) enjoy the swiping function that so many Tinder users enjoy.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an Android application with the backend rooted in the SQLite database packet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The integration between the front and the back end posed many difficult issues. Working with Android Studio in general was also difficult because we had little to no experience in the Android IDE.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to successfully create our database and add to / retrieve from it through Android Studio. It was our first hackathon, and we were able to pull together an app that we could demo so we're  very proud of that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio, how to integrate SQLite with it, and the fact that at hackathons, the best strategy would probably be to have at least one person working on a demoable front end version of the app towards the beginning of the hackathon, simply so that we do not encounter the same problem as this time that we focused too much on the backend and do not have enough of the front end to properly demo our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pinder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, we would like to implement a Google Maps API in order to map users to the spaces they have saved and potentially generate optimized tours for them. Then, we would like to expand the 'swipes' from public spaces to all types of places and attractions to serve a more local user group by helping them get ideas for days on which they might find themselves bored or wanting to explore new areas or activities.
