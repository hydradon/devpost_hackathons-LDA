                    Losing weight and maintaining your weight after a diet is extremely challenging. There are lots of contradicting information out there, so how do you know what actually works for you?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wouldn't it be great if you can have a personal dieting coach to tell you anytime if whatever you are eating will cause YOU to gain or lose weight?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you can with
                    <strong>
                        Diet Coach Bot
                    </strong>
                    !
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Diet Coach Bot you record your weight and what you eat daily and your Bot will use
                    <strong>
                        machine learning
                    </strong>
                    to predict how each food or drink is affecting your weight. The more you use your coach the more accurate it becomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By knowing in realtime how much the food you are eating is affecting your weight, you can now make daily adjustments in order to find a diet that you can enjoy and sustain!
