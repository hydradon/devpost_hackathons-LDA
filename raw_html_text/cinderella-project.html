                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As Juniors in high school prepping for prom, we realize how much of a hassle buying a dress can be. Cinderella Project makes it simple!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Your fairy godmother will dress you up for any event by asking you several questions about your taste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used IBM's watson to create your fairy godmother chatbot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything we did was a challenge as we never created a chat bot before. It was extremely frustrating trying to learn about the functions of intents and entities. Overcoming our challenges has really helped us learn new things about the world of chat bots.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of creating our fairy godmother's personality. She knows a thing or two about fashion and will make you feel like Cinderella ;) We are also pleased with our web design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use node.js and how to implement it in IBM's Watson bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Cinderella Project
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to make the experience even more magical with the addition of dresses and a wider selection of dresses to match the user's preferences.
