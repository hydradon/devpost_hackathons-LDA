                    Inspiration:
We were inspired by the "Redefine the Virtual Closet" category and decided to put our own twist on it.

                    What it does:
Keeps track of your wardrobe, helps you decide what to wear, and so much more.

                <p>
                    How we built it:
We successfully built this app using AWS, Amazon Alexa, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Lambda, Amazon Develop Console, Amazon Templates, and Android Studio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into:
Understanding the Amazon Developer Console and Amazon Lambda as these were brand new to some of us. Also, Android Studio was challenging to work with when it came to the initial setup of things.

                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
Beginning and successfully completing a project that we had little experience working with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned:
How to use Amazon Alexa, AWS, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Lambda, Amazon Developer Console, and Javascript.
