                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As it was a long 36 hours hackathon, we wanted to develop a product where we can learn and have fun using different technologies. But a point we have it clear from the begining, is that we also wanted to make a prototype that it's idea could be useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HackEyes is a robot car controlled by air gestures. The user can also see throw Google Cardboard a first person view that it is connected into a camera that the car has.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the user rotates his head it moves the camera that it is installed on the car, so it gives the illusion to be driving in real person the car.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, we decided the technology to use, plan how we were going to work and printed the robot arm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we started building a custom Google Cardboard viewer so we could reproduce video simultaneously in both parts of the screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following step was to transmit video from the Raspberry Pi into that player, adapting it to accept livestream connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next thing to do was programming the movement of the camera attached to the device building a rest api with flask, so the servos move together with the camera.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To finish, we connected Leap Motion to the Raspberry via a rest service and constructed the robot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, we thought about building the prototype with a phone attatched to the robot, but the robotic arm printed as not strong enough to support it. In that case, we decided to run to buy a smaller camera that we could program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our second problem came with the connection via streaming. We spend almost 10 consecutive hours trying to fix this bug.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third challenge we had is that we didn't sleep so much.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The user can see what the robot it is seeing via streaming.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If user moves the head, the camera will move to this position.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The car it is controlled by using air gestures.
-It works and only in 36 hours!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some people of the team didn't know about arduino or raspberry. Also no one of use didn't know anything about video streaming or leap motion.
                </p>
