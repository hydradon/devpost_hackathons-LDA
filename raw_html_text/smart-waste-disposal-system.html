                    Currently garbage collectors have to empty the bins on a regular schedule and follow a route.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They could take longer replacing the bins and/or do not need to replace it at all while having to manually check every time if &ldquo;covers&rdquo; are still intact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cleaner community as we are always enabling people to dispose their garbage
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reduce the amount of travel for the collectors if the bins do not need replacing
                </p>
                <p>
                    Collectors can now be repurposed for other projects
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reduce the pest/insect population
                </p>
                <p>
                    Success can be measured by the reduction in cost (gas and time of collectors)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obtaining data such as most used/replaced bins and creating routines around the use of the bins
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simple solution that can be initially implemented in the Region of Peel and can be quickly expanded throughout the nation.
