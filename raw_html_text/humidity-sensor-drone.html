                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What we wanted it to do: We wanted to build something that would help firefighters or people involved in emergency management to respond to an emergency remotely with a drone before actually getting there. So we wanted to make a car with a temperature, humidity and sound sensor that detects large changes in these values and reports them to the drone. If the change is large enough, the drone will get position coordinates from the car and fly to that position for surveillance before emergency managers are called.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack can detect changes in humidity in its vicinity and send this data to the laptop. The laptop sends this data to the drone and the drone flies if there is a large increase or decrease in humidity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a microduino mCookie to detect changes in temperature and humidity. We then programmed it with Arduino. We got values of temperature and humidity on the computer and wrote them to a text file using a software called CoolTerm. Then we passed these values to a javascript program we wrote for the drone. If these values crossed a certain threshold, the drone flies in that area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to program the drone with javascript. We had to use opensource code from Node js. The biggest problem that we ran into was that the microduino could only print temperature and humidity values to the screen of the laptop but these values were not actually getting saved. After a lot of research on the internet, we were able to find this software called CoolTerm that allowed us to do that. Unfortunately, the values are not written to a text file in real time, so we still need human intervention to save the text file and run the drone program periodically to check for large changes.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to control the drone's movements with javascript. We can read text files on javascript and make the drone respond to large changes. We were also able to get text files from arduino to the laptop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a lot of programming knowledge in two languages in particular - Arduino and Javascript. We also made a microduino circuit for the first time and also hacked a drone with a laptop for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Humidity Sensor Drone
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step will be to save humidity values to a text file in real time without human intervention. Also the microduino should also be placed on a car and move around passing its position coordinates (relative to the drone) to the laptop. The drone receives these position coordinates from the laptop and moves to the exact position of the microduino car and it feeds back image data from its camera back to the laptop.
