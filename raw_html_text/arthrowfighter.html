                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our group members mother suffers from arthritis, and he wanted to help her get better with a fun process that she would have fun using.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a glove that lets elderly input gestures that control a character on their phone. Their grandchild can use their phone to control the other character on the elderly phone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took sensory info. from the Arduino bot on a glove, then we exported that information to python. The python reads that and sends it to a firebase database. At the same time the 2nd phone( child phone) has three controls that have the same affect as the elderly and that data is sent to firebase. The first phone(elderly) retrieves that and shows it on the screen.
                </p>
