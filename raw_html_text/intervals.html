                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a music minor, I spend a lot of time counting intervals. I figured that if I can automate this process, I can save time on music theory homework, as well as general arranging and composition.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives quality and type of any interval comprised of two notes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly dependent on the fact that all letters and numbers have an ASCII value, which allowed me to convert from char to int multiple times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Had some issues with negative integers as that does not make sense in music theory, but I fixed it using overflow (e.g. -1 becoming 11)
                </p>
