                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to see what I could do with the Wegmans API... see what information I can pull, see what I can do to display it in a nice way for the user. Basically, it was an investigation into what it creates to make an online store.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website allows you to search for items in the Wegmans API using a simple string search (e.g. how you would use a searchbar). It sends a request to the API, and displays results in a table. A user can click on a result to see information about the product (manufacturer, a more descriptive name, price), and can opt to add a quantity to add it to their "Shopping Cart".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once items are added to the shopping cart, we send a request to the API for each item's price + qty, and display the cost in the table seen (both individual price and total price).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the WebApp using Node.js on the backend, and AngularJS on the front end. I created a mix of Angular controllers and components to handle different parts of the page (e.g. the shopping cart was a component where I simply pass it a list of selected items).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To build the AngularJS code, I used webpack to compile all of the libraries into a single bundle that I imported in my base template. My angular templates were built in HTML, but my base templates used by the pages were built in Jade, which is a kind of weird templating language... I don't really think I like it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The majority of my RESTful routes all pointed to a common file that handled
                    <code>
                        /api/*
                    </code>
                    . I received requests there, and called
                    <code>
                        api_service.js
                    </code>
                    to handle formatting + handling requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I attempted to send requests to the API for getting the total cart cost, so there wouldn't be any "off-by-one" errors, but I was unable to get good responses back then sending POST requests of type "application/json". I'm not totally sure why, because I was still getting a 200 back from the API, but I couldn't extract any of the information. I was able to successfully send requests in PostMan, which makes it a little confusing as to why I couldn't in Node... maybe I had to get the response back differently.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I hadn't really stood up a Node.js webapp before, so I was pretty proud of doing that. Also, I'm proud of the amount of hits on the API I was able to accomplish successfully. I fully expected more issues like I ran into when trying to hit
                    <code>
                        /pricepublic/cart/total
                    </code>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a decent bit about how to send requests to APIs, though I sort've hacked it in that I kiiiinda copy pasted the same request promise and made individual modifications for each function. I think I could do better next time by figuring out a generic way to send a request to the API, and pass a function pointer to handle the response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also ended up figuring out how to successfully save a bearer token, and automatically refresh it if it was expired. This was kinda nice, because I wasted some time building a UI to manually refresh it, and then I'd go and copy paste it, which was a little slow... maybe not an optimization I needed though.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A couple things I'd like to attempt next is to attach cart items to the session's cookie, that way users can refresh the page w/o issue.
