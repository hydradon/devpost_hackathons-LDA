                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a way to quickly prototype convention booths in a fun and iterative way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an android application that allows you to take a photo of miniature color coded structures (Lego's work great) and builds out a 3D game representation of your miniature. The color coded blocks then are analyzed and converted into different preset materials (glass, wood, etc.). So a simple lego building/booth can suddenly be transformed into a high fidelity, realistic booth representation you can walk around in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Im using unity to capture photo's from the Android device. I then take that texture and analyze the pixels. Using that pixel array I look for color changes. When a color change of significant value is detected a cube is generated with its dimensions and qualities pulled from information from the pixel array.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially I was creating pictures and putting them around a cube but the textures were paper thin and just looked bad even after alpha masking and playing with them for a while. Halfway through the day I decided to switch to mesh generation.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of the tool. It's really neat a photograph can create a physical object. It wasnt something I had ever done before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned about unity's Texture.GetPixel() function in incredible depth and a neat way to generate objects based on photograph color data.
                </p>

                    What's next for VR Booth Generator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I need to work out some bugs and test with complex image sources. I also want to set up the object swap function so if it sees a blue lego block for example it will replace it with a high fidelity glass object of the correct height and location.
