                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Several of us on the team came from far away to attend college on a campus we hadn't yet seen in person. In a perfect world, we would have liked to see the campus from first-person-view to experience the vibe and the community as if we were personally present. 
A solution to this problem was to create a virtual tour guide mascot - a robot that could allow remote users to tour a new environment (college campus, workplace, neighborhood) through the eyes of a friendly-looking tour guide mascot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows users all over the world to access an interface from which they can control a "college mascot" - A live video stream allows them to see the campus and interact with the tour guide by asking it questions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With three burnt motor drivers, two power banks that kept turning off, and one great team dynamic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to complete a hardware hack, which resulted in a lack of parts and many many hours of debugging. We were not able to build a battery from scratch either.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a monster truck. Also, we learned to use dialogflow and became accustomed to its many perks and flaws.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>

                    What's next for Mascot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to build a more life-like version of the mascot.
