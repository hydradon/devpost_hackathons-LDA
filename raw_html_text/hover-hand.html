                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had the idea a while ago, but many failed implementations -- lots of weird technical problems and buggy libraries. I decided to rewrite it from scratch, with a focus on the core features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It idea is that you use the camera on your phone to do motion control, and 3d position controlling.

                <p>
                    3D motion tracking. Like a Leap Motion but with your phone.

                    Javascript (ES2016), Heroku, stuff like that.
