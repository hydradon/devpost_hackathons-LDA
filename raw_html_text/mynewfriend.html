                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know people who are stressed out and we created this website in hope to help them be better people mentally.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gives teens advice on common problems they may face and can even drop suicide rates across America.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a series of div classes, links,Youtube Api,and Images that would support our topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A member of the group often slack off and we had some struggles coding Api's. Also the night shift was really tiring.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all didnt come the knowledge of Api but we picked it up on our way and our API product came out nice. Also this was our first hackaton and we did great.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Api, Bootstrap,and we leaned more about teamwork skills.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to be able to create a chatting system using a kik API and a comments section at the bottom of the pages.
