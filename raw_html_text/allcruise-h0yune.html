                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The presentation about millennials not being interested in cruise ships, despite the many fun experiences people have had on cruise ships.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows for a fun interactive AR experience on the web with access to promo codes for discounts on cruising.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used JavaScript and HTML along with the AR.js library to have AR, right on your phone or computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Textures not working, issues with switching between 3d renders using javascript, 3d models were moving on click instead of staying stationary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to learn javascript from scratch in the course of a few hours, and make a fun project out of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript, AR.js library, Flask framework
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for AllCruise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The hope for AllCruise is to be able to have this idea become the inception of a better one that can help get GenX/Y out on to cruise ships.
