                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration stems not only from an inherent desire to better our community, but position it for future success and prosperity. Continually executing all endeavors with the recognition and understanding that adaptability is necessary, rather than solely accounting for the aspects of the obstacles facing today. Shelter1 is built to accommodate the changing needs based on providers, clients, stakeholders and geography, therefore providing a one stop source to answer needs. The aim, goal and mission of Shelter1 is to transition providers from the role of reactors to needs to proactively anticipating, planning for and managing needs using predictive modeling through data analytics.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Building from a collaborative environment for providers Shelter1 provides client facing interfaces to view resources via a GUI that allows for individual specific data retrieval. Shelter1 furthers its capacity in the gathering, tracking and display of data analysis and trends through a customizable and scalable dashboard. Allowing for each provider to set thresholds for warnings indicating resource available from a day-to-day (availability of emergency shelter or food [plates]) basis to seasonal (climate) or annual trends (population influx, natural disaster).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The gathering of data will allow for the processing and viewing of metrics for individual providers to analysis of individual, regional, statewide, and beyond. This analysis can be used to demonstrate effective solutions throughout a region or state with hopes of identification and replication in other localities in better service to the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In short:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shelter1 provides a means to connect clients, providers and stakeholders, facilitate their collaborative efforts in receiving and disseminating resources while building the community.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized open-source frameworks as well as supporting technology throughout. PostgreSQL is used for data storage, which is exposed via an API built using Python and the Flask microframework. On the end user side, Nodejs and Angular were the foundation to create a responsive interface supporting a variety of devices from smartphone to desktop.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Open source requirement moved us into a less comfortable realm of development.

                <p>
                    Being a part of GlobalHack VI in and of itself is a huge accomplishment, in today's world it is all to easy to say one is busy and simply cannot attend, carving out the time and dedicating one's efforts and skillsets coming together as a team to address a local and global issue.
