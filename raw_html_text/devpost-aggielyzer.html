                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While brainstorming, we were trying to come up with original ideas and realized there was not a sure way to know if our ideas were original. We decided to create a program that would sort through past Devposts and display to the user if that topic has been done previously. It will also give the user inspiration for ways to improve past projects or create new innovated projects.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project is a python app that allows users to insert a keyword and receive results based on how often their word comes up in previous projects. This will help evaluate originality and ensure that new ideas are explored. The app scrapes data from Devpost and then formats the data in an easy to read format for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using Python through VS code, Beautiful Soup, urllib, and re.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our biggest challenges was coding in Python. Our team members had experience in coding with Java, but Python was a fairly new language for all of us. We realized there still was a similarity between the two languages, the syntax was just a little bit different. Another challenge we faced was working with web requests for the first time, which was important to overcome because it was a central part of our program.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we overcame the challenges presented and eventually got it to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely gained a better understanding of Python and gathering data from web pages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Devpost Aggielyzer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next step would be to speed up the data analysis. For example, it takes about 40 seconds to extract 4 pages of data from Devpost, which amounts to about 10 seconds per page. We calculated that the time it took to load pages scaled linearly and given that Devpost has over 5,000 project pages, it would take about 14 hours to load them all. These problems can be overcome with further optimization, which will allow a greater level of accessibility for all hackers.
