                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever walked out your house only to realize that you locked yourself out? Well, I definitely have and trying to get back inside through the window is not fun at all. This was our inspiration for today as we present our program that has the abilities to change this problem and provide a potential solution for this unfortunate occurrence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed this program to essentially allow the user to unlock or lock a door using voice commands. First, a password will be spoken and checked to confirm if it is correct. The action is then executed (either lock or unlock the door) and can allow the user to operate a lock with minimal effort from both sides of the door.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the Google Cloud Speech to Text API to transcribe voice commands to text. The text is then compared with a user set text file to determine action and authentication. The Raspberry Pi is used to deliver the actual power and action as represented by the led demo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Enabling and setting up the API even with the Google Documentation was difficult as instructions were very vague.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>

                    Successfully transcribing the voice commands to text

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use new commands in the terminal to do specific tasks and the how to use the Google Cloud API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LockOrNot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make the program run continuously in the background and allow the user input audio in real time. This allow the program to be more practical and allow for streaming audio from a microphone anytime. We would also like to create an app to host this service and allow for basic user key commands controlled from the app.
