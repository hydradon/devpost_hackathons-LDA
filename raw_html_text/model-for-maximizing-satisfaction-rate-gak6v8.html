                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When there are a lot of orders in the dining hall, the order that takes the least period of time to be prepared might take a very long time, which leads to the dissatisfaction of the student's experience in the dinings. Students are often busy, and due to a lot of assignments, they can get easily stressed or frustrated. Especially, in residential colleges, meals at the dining hall make up a large portion of their college experience, and we do not want to add more frustration by making them wait longer than what they expect to. So, we would like to develop an app that could help build a more effective system for the dining halls, by concentrating on maximizing the total satisfaction rate of the students so that the students have a better dining experience.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app stores the names of the items in the menu and the time required to prepare individual items. Based on that, the program collects the data from all the students who placed an order in a live manner and figures out the sequence in which the meals can be prepared most effectively, which might not necessarily be in the order that they came in.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Adobe Xd CC for prototyping and Python for developing the app/website.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we were only beginner-level programmers, we had to spend a lot of time doing research and studying documentation of the built-in functions in Python. We mostly faced difficulty while trying to integrate mathematical models in our program.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During the hackathon, we attended a prototyping workshop with Adobe XD. In the workshop, we got to explore our prototyping skills and were able to implement it in our project. Also, though we were not able to fully include our mathematical calculations in the program, we are proud that we have at least come up with possible mathematical models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No matter what role you play in a team, you must remember that it is not a team without you. So, recognizing that people have different strength's and weaknesses and being able to overcome those differences in order to make the best out of it is very important.

                    What's next for Model for Maximizing Satisfaction Rate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allowing users to set up a pick-up time so as to improve the satisfaction rate of the customers. Also, we need further research on the behavior of the students to yield more accurate results.
