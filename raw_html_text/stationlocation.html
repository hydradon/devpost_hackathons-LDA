                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting lost in the city with no data on our phones and refusing to asking for directions
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a REST API for providing information about nearest train stations from a specific point
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the open NYC data set for train stations. We used python and flask for the API endpoints, and mongodb with geoJSON formatting to store data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We actually wanted to use java for this, but we had difficulty with that, so we switched to python. Then we wanted to incorporate it with twilio, but that was very difficult too.We also had trouble querying the database, but after we figured that out, the rest of the project went pretty smooth.
                </p>

                    Getting this to actually work.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use mongodb, and a lot about data formatting. We also learned a lot about APIs and endpoints.

                    What's next for StationLocation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll probably try to integrate it with twilio, so it's more helpful for pedestrians without cellular data. Also, adding data for MTA buses. Right now, its only useful to developers who want to include some information to their users.
