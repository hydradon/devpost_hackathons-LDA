                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As an owner of led lights, I find it extremely inconvenient and frustrating to use the remote included with the lights as the remote has to be pointed directly at the sensor box. This means that the user has to be adjacent to the box in order to turn on the lights. Our application allows the user to turn on the lights from anywhere in the house including the comfort of his/her own bed. This also allows the user to hide the unattractive sensor box which is important to individuals who are concerned with cable management.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application features a button that allows the user to turn on bluetooth which then allows wireless connectivity to the arduino which controls the leds. This includes an on/off button that sends a binary signal to the arduino which is then interpreted and turns on the leds. There is also a color wheel feature that allows the user to select a color.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Mit App inventor to create the application portion and wrote a java file in notepad++ for the arduino to interpret the information transmitted from the application. The arduino is set up by attaching bluetooth and the led strip lights.
