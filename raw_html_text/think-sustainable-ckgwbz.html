                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have been inspired by our raising concern of the effect we have on our planet. Most people are aware of recycling being a good method of helping the planet, but many people are unaware of the effect the production and transportation of the items they are using. This web app would allow the user to visualize their carbon footprint on the planet, and how many trees would need to be replenished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app contains a bar-code API, which allows the user to scan the item and another API would gather the relative information and we would compute the impact the purchase of each item has on the planet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a mixture of various restful API's and implemented them using axios javascript to return the required values. We used bootstrap, HTML and CSS to create the web page and used javascript for data visualisation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have spent a large majority of the hackathon attempting to create a drone facial recognition software. However, past halfway through the hackathon the drones failed causing us to brainstorm new ideas and create a new app in less than half the time available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our ability to adapt to the situation and starting a project from start after investing a substantial amount of our available time on a different project. I believe that we have adapted quite well to this change and created a responsive, well thought out app in the given time frame we had left.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to combine various API's into one project to create a responsive app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Think Sustainable
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would give the user alternatives which are better for the environment and would reduce a persons carbon footprint.
