                    We were inspired by a TED talk on procrastination that focused on how little time we have. This app reminds us of that in subtle notes. It was built with Android Studio and Java. Converting to Android from a standard Java application was a bit difficult at first, but a very fun learning experience, as I am now MUCH more confident with the android SDK.

                    We as a team are proud of this project for one reason; it is something we need. We identified a problem and acted on it. No amount of health apps, or fitness planning is worth anything if you do not act on them. We as a human race are capable of incredible things, but we often don't achieve this level of greatness for lack of focus. This will help with that.

                    Given though, it is not perfect, and it has a long way to go. There are a lot more things we want to add to make this better for us to use personally, and all the merrier if others enjoy it as well.
