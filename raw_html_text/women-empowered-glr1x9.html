                    Inspiration Two computer science and a studio art freshman teamed up at a hackathon. Our task: to create something to light the way for women in STEM. We decided to use this light as the motivation for our app. As you progress through our timeline mapping the history of women who were pioneers in STEM, the light bulb fills up to depict a gradient of light (in the Technica colors, no less).
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does The app takes the user through a timeline of historical innovations in STEM, all spearheaded by women. It empowers girls to take risks and pursue their own paths to STEM careers.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it We combined our technical and artistic skills using AppLab and Procreate to make the app. We started by sketching out the design for the light bulb, the theme for the program. We then added event listeners using javascript to transition between periods in history and to animate the light bulb.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into The brainstorming process was definitely a challenge. We struggled to narrow down our ideas to one concrete plan, because we wanted to do so much but only had a brief timespan in which to execute it. This is also our first time at a hackathon, so it was intimidating to get started! Luckily, our team worked well together and we were able to come up with something that felt authentic.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of We really like our user interface, and we think that it will appeal to girls everywhere who are interested in STEM.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned We learned how to work together in under 24 hours to create an app! Aside from that, we learned a lot from the events held at Technica, like the Git and machine learning workshops.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for women emPOWERed We hope to develop this into a full time app using Android Studio. Hopefully, it will expand to have more features, like a job inspiration category, which would take a persons interests into account and run an algorithm to predict a STEM-related career that they might enjoy.
