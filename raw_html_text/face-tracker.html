                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is mainly built on top of the OpenCV.

                <p>
                    Implement machine learning functionality so that the application be trained to track various kind of object
Implements video output functionality 
Finish error handling routines in case there is a corruption of video feed
