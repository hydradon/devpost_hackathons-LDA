                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We always wondered how physics is applied in fields outside of it. Reading its applications in finance, we were inspired to explore this phenomenon and create a simulation of our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simulates Brownian Motions of a particle in 2-dimensional space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With passion, python, and a whole lot of coffee!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simple things like animating and making the code function. Coming from a zero programming background, everything today is a learning experience!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the code to work!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding is a team effort. In fact, we realized the idea generation phase is, just as, if not, more important than its implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Brownian Motion: From Finance to Pollock
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With better skills in programming and a deeper understanding beyond first year physics, we could potentially apply this into aspects of river delta cleaning in our home countries, India and Malaysia!
