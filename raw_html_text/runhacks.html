                    Hackathons are really difficult to run smoothly, all the way from check-in to submission. RunHacks helps organizers by introducing several helpful services to help make sure the logistical procedure of a hackathon is as pleasant as can be.

                    How it's built
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a web app using Angular.js for the front end and mongoDB and node.js for the backend.

                    What was learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These environments were new for most of our team, so picking up extra frameworks and libraries, especially widely used ones is always a nice skill.
