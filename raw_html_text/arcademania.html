                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration was to make an optimal entertainment experience. We realized many games were not that fun, and were too easy to create so we decided to mix them both and create an optimal gaming experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a program with 2 games, a paddle game and also our unique evade and conquer game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with python and the library tkinter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenges we ran into were creating certain functions for the game and also making the GUI very user friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud to create  2 games from scratch and work functionally. Even though this is our first actual hackathon we learnt a lot and are really proud of our accomplishments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt some time functions and time.time functions. Stack Overflow was our best friend today because a lot of the ideas we wanted to replicate in code were hard, until we used Stack Overflow for assistance.

                    What's next for ArcadeMania
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next few steps for ArcadeMania is creating a easier GUI and making it way more user-friendly. We also would love to add more than 2 games to this "arcade" and also incorporate many logic, memory, fun, and useful games for school, work and travel.
