                    The app makes it easier for associates to give feedback on how they feel in the workplace, through a simpler and easier to navigate layout, a feed where associates can view others' comments and addition of pre-made responses or comments to submit.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team used Android Studio and github for version control.

                    Challenges I ran into

                    Our team had some challenges understanding the existing app and integrating its components into our app.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    More improvements in the UI to make it more visually appealing and easier to navigate for the associates.
Also, adding different views to the app such as the manager view that consists of more charts that will be useful.
