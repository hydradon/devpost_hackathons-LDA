                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I take &uuml;ber home from school frequently and I thought that there must be a better, more economical way. I knew that there were a lot of different ride sharing companies so all i needed was a application that could find the best one for me.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sorts through various ridesharing APIs for cheapest estimated price and lowest times.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started by writing the code that accessed the APIs for the various ridesharing companies. This included the API's for companies like lyft and &uuml;ber, some of which required a constant reauthentication every hour with a new authentication token. After that, we wrote the html for our front-end and then integrated in the back end, using jQuery to update the values in the tables to get the best values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Retrieving the JSON. Studying the API's. pretty much everthing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to request the JSON and get a url with the JSON in it. Jakes significant improvement in his HTML skills. And most of all our perserverance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot. How to request data from API's and pretty much everything about API's. For about 12 hours we learned about CORS and HTTP Protocol.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Flux Rides
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we had extra time we wanted to make a seamless app in which you can order the car through without going through the ride sharing company's App. We also only had time to work on &uuml;ber and a little bit of Lyft's API's and we were hoping to work with several more options.
