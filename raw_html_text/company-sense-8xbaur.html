                    Company Sense is a web app where you can search for an organization, and from a couple of graphs know the popularity (number of mentions) and people's sentiments (sentiment score) about the organization. Positive articles lead to a good sentiment score, negative articles bring the score down. From the graph, users can view one week worth of data. Organizations can use this for feedback, and investors can use this in making a better decisions about their investments; lower popularity and bad sentiments usually led to a drop in stock prices. Investors will no longer have to keep an eye on every single development about the company to know how the world feels about the company. This is just a simple tool that helps organizations and investors alike.

                    How we made it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google news API to get articles from the internet, and used the Google Cloud Natural Language API to process those articles to find the sentiments in them, and link those sentiments to an organization. We made a database using mlab for thousands of organizations, and stored their sentiment values and mentions in them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Company Sense
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think we could consider other factors to be more accurate in predicting stock prices. Machine learning with neural networks can analyze the data better and predict prices to a statistical degree.
