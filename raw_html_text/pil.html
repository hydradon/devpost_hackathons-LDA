                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oftentimes I miss out taking my medical prescriptions, (for days even) so we made a system that would make it easy to adhere to a schedule and keep a constant stream of communication with my doctor and I.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app aims to allow doctor users to monitor and link new drugs/medications to patient users. Also on the patient side, we aimed to have a notification service alert users when to take the medication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our target device was the android platform, so our front end is all Java, for the backend, we use a combination of MySql and python to define endpoints for an inhouse API Some other APIs we used were the Health Canada Drug Database, we also delved a bit into scipy for drug recommendation.
