                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to simulate bad actors in on-chain governance, and its ramifications moving forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    IF I GET TO PRESENT THIS PROJECT ON STAGE, I WILL SELL MY MOLOCHDAO VOTING POWER TO PASS ONE PROPOSAL FROM THE AUDIENCE (which I think will be incredible and fun :D )
                </p>
                <p>
                    So PLEASE, try not to send ETH to the app beforehand!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creates a proxy contract that you set as your delegate voting key in MolochDAO or a Moloch-like DAO, that lets you sell our voting power to the highest bidder. It will work on Moloch, YangDAO, MetaCartelDAO, OrochiDAO, etc...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created a proxy contract using Solidity, deployed to Mainnet. This contract is awaiting a 1 ETH payout, and whomever is the first to pay, will be able to create 1 Proposal, and vote on it on MolochDAO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created a UI as well to let people buy this voting power.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot more that I could have done given time. An auction based system that extends over time, or even further delegation once someone buys a vote.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a great proof of concept, works on Mainnet, on a popular project, and is a great way to show people that with onchain governance and DAOs, vote buying will be very real.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I love what I do :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SelloutDAO
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't know if I want to expand on it much, the idea would be to prevent this sort of proxy to be used on other DAOs. I may try to convince one or two other members to try it out on their DAOs.
