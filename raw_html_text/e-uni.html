                    College campuses are great places to meet friends that will last a lifetime.
However, finding those special people can be the difficult part.
With the E-Uni app, we promote inclusion and connections among students.
Need, a friend to go to the cafe with? Need concert buddies? E-Uni is the app for you.
The purpose of this project is to connect students through public events held on campus by other students and university organizations.
Whether you're looking for a friend or a new crew to roll with on campus, E-Uni.
