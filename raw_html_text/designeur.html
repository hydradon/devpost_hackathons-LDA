                        We realize how important patience was throughout the Hackathon. This was one of our first times coding, so when we decided to develop a website, the process was a bit intimidating. We dedicated a majority of our time starting from the beginning with defining terminology such as what a div was, and what all the slashes, semicolons, and brakets meant, we continued doing, as we were inspired that the best way to learn is to do.

                    <em>
                        As more than half our our team are first time hackers, we did not expect to build a website such as we did within twenty-four hours. We surprised ourselves with the skills we learned throughout the workshops and were able immediately implement for our project. Our collective motivation, open-mindedness, and excitement throughout the process is also something we are proud of.

                        . All of us were interested and open-minded to learn from fellow Hackers as well as the awesome and talented mentors, as first-time hackers. We learned what Terminal was, basic terminology, how to use programs such as html, css, and what Sublime Text was. To proudly and simply state: we successfully learned how to hack (AND got sleep!).
