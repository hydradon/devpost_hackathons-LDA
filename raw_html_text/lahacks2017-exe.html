                    As math majors, we are often frustrated by the scarcity of low-cost, high-quality practice problems available for the material we learn. While the internet has revolutionized many areas of education, it&rsquo;s the case that in order to get (for example) challenging group theory problems, you must buy a textbook. Our goal at LA Hacks was to solve this issue by creating a free, general-purpose problem generator.

                    Currently, entra&icirc;ner generates integration problems, although our code is fully generalizable, with the potential to produce problems about:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Asymptotic Runtime (Computer Science)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Abstract Algebra (Mathematics)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Argument Validity (Logic)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Essentially, entra&icirc;ner can be configured to produce any kind of problem with step-by-step solutions. Moreover, entra&icirc;ner can show the step-by-step solution to each problem it generates. Because of the high granularity of control you get over the problem generation, this becomes a very helpful tool for students who want to drill certain problem-solving techniques. Students can register accounts to save their problems and see their progress over time.

                    Entra&icirc;ner also includes features for instructors. Teacher accounts can create classes, post customized assignments to those classes, and see how their students did on those assignments. Cheating becomes much more difficult, because entra&icirc;ner randomly generates different problems for each student.
