                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally the idea was to improve gym training experience by using movesense. However, it ended up as an improvement of developers experience by implementing react-native library
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The library gets access to the native functions and get values from the Movesense sensor to JavaScript. At the moment the library can get access to all values collected from movesense sensor. However, the coming data is not updated in real time and this feature will be added in the feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the library has a layout for gym training mobile application with all necessary data rendered on the screen including exercise instructions, sensor status, temperature, heart rate and accelerometer values.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From the beginning the target was to create mobile application which will help user to make exercises in a correct way. This was planned to achieve using the accelerometer and gyroscope values and counting the movements and angles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To achieve the target we have planned to implement the native IOS example application to React-Native framework for awesome developer experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge for us was to pass the data to javascript in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we have created the library that will help other developers to do awesome staff with movesense sensor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to create a bridge between completely different programming languages,
We learn how to improve gym training with the help of IoT
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Movesense React-Native Library (with GYM use case)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first stage is to finnish the library with the real time data and proper documentation
The second stage is to create a gym training application with the implementation of the movesense sensors
