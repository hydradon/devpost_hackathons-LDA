                <p>
                    The GatorPik web application is a tool for University of Florida students to determine the order of classes to take in future semesters.  By copy+pasting their Degree Audit
into the web app, we're able to scrape their completed classes and class requirements.  We then build a dependency graph using real-time data scraped from the University of
Florida Course Listing to determine which classes are prerequisites for others and the students class requirements to build an ordered list of classes to take first at the
front and classes to take last at the end.  We display this information to the student using a web interface that includes the feature of highlighting prerequisites for
classes on mouse over.

                    How to Read the Results
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When your class list has been calculated, a list of classes will appear, with classes you should take first at the top and those to take later at the bottom.  _ Be warned! _ The
system currently does not distinguish between optional prerequisites and required ones, as well as technical electives, so you should use the list as a
                    <strong>
                        reference
                    </strong>
                    in taking
the indicated classes, not as the only possible route!
