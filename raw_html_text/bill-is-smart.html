                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking at creative ways to advertise my startup. I was utilizing Google Adverts, Facebook Ads etc. One day I was sat in a take-a-way and I noticed a poster. This caught my attention and got me thinking whether having my advert placed in public places would help me reach my target audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where the idea for Bill is smart came from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This platform allows businesses to bid for advertisement in the local area. In addition businesses can signup to display our adverts from our network. The platform is based on the cloud and has clients built on top of Rasberry-Pi. This means the startup costs are not huge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The platform will allow for interacting with the adverts. One issue that we came across was tracking the people that see these adverts. This is where we utilized Haven's Face Detection APIs. We have a proof of concept which detects the number of impressions an advertisement has had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built with love, utilizing Node.js &amp; the chromium engine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The ports on the WiFi effected the speed we could work at. Their were no other main issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that companies would love to use. Our startup Eat Homely would really gain attraction from utilizing this new innovative platform.
                </p>
