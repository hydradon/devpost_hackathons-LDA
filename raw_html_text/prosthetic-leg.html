                    Our project is a prosthetic that is adjustable for children who are growing. This is targeted for children in developing countries because they don't have the resources to get it refitted as they grow. The reason we chose this topic is that we are both bioengineers and we have a passion for taking what we have learned and applying it to real world issues. In addition, we were inspired by a shoe that was invented to grow as a child's foot grows. We both found this idea to be ingenious and very impactful. When designing and building the prosthetic, we took into account our mechanical backgrounds and we only used materials found in the lab.
