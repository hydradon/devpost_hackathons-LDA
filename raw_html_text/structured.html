                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for Structured originated from our realization that everyday people, because of the maturity of the Ethereum ecosystem, could now create diversified portfolios, with directional opinions (longs and shorts), as well as engage with assets outside of "traditionally risky cryptocurrencies" (foreign-exchange, fixed-income). Though all the pieces existed as smart contracts, we knew a few people that wanted to take advantage of the decentralized finance revolution, but that just couldn't get their heads around Compound, Kyber, Uniswap, Synthetix, wBTC, etc... and especially didn't know how to use them in concert with one another. So, we wanted to create a simple platform that allowed people to simply send in their Ether using a simple web interface and have pre-considered, hedged portfolio compositions at their fingertips without middlemen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Structured allows people to select a portfolio that matches their risk tolerance and reward expectations, and purchase that portfolio in seconds, without custodians or brokers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We deployed the smart contracts to the Ethereum mainnet, and then built a simple front-end that could work with Web3 providers like MetaMask. We attempted to develop a friendly interface for people to engage with the smart contracts without being technical or blockchain experts. Additionally, we created a tutorial video for people who needed a "hold-my-hand" experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the tools we used were a bit sparser than we would have liked on documentation. Which is to be expected for new platforms. This, matched with the way developers must build using Solidity these days, is a major hurdle. Fun hurdles, nonetheless.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were really proud that we were able to create a fully decentralized basketed currency portfolio (similar in composition to Facebook's proposed Libra) using Synthetix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to leverage Fulcrum, Synthetix, and Compound interfaces via solidity. We also used wBTC for the first time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Structured
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to develop more portfolio compositions and structured asset NFTs, as well as to work to connect traditional asset managers and financial advisers with the decentralized finance space.
