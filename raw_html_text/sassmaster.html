                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to help people with psychological disorders that impair the ability to pick up social cues (i.e. schizophrenia, autism, social anxiety, ADHD, etc) and also English-language learners with an API that can determine whether a text statement is sarcastic or not.  We decided on an API because we feel that this has multiple use cases, like a browser extension to check if forum posts are sarcastic, a phone app that checks how sarcastic your/others' texts are, or book reader app that highlights the sarcastic portions of a book.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our API uses a Recurrent Neural Network combined with a statistical model using Bayesian statistics and word frequency to determine whether or not a sentence is sarcastic.

                <p>
                    We use Lua and the Torch library to train a neural network using sarcastic/non-sarcastic statements from a

                    </a>
                    .  After that, we made a REST API on a Ruby web server.
