                    After struggling with low citizen engagement with the 311 service, the city of Brampton will gather new citizen input from a simpler platform for a public input service -- through a first party application.

                <p>
                    The public is generally disengaged from the current 311 public feedback platform because it exists on old technology that people are not aware of, or do not wish to use the telephone service because it relies on verbal human interaction. The 311 web form is also outdated and non-portable, since most people prefer to use mobile apps over mobile browsers.

                    In a similar manner, newspapers are becoming increasingly ineffective at disseminating public information about planned projects that people complain about after the fact instead, as their readership decreases and also fails to represent the younger demographics. An app can communicate this in a less formal way to get at least the point across, while a wall of text on a newspaper is discouraging to readers.
