                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help future home owners and shelter seekers ease the stress and make simpler the home search process. No matter how specific a family's or individual's preferences are, we're ready to help meet those requirements. Also, Suitable Homes is not only geared toward those who are interested in buying a home, but also those who are seeking shelter in times of a natural crisis or due to special circumstance. It is critical that all people have access to a space where they can find comfort and feel at home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app asks the user to fill our a search questionnaire that narrows down search radius, location, neighborhood quality, school district, type of home, and many more specifically tailored questions so that the program can return the most suitable living spaces for the user. In terms of shelter, we make sure that in relation to where the user is currently located in times of a natural disaster, the nearest building that has an established shelter is well equipped and accessible to the user through the connection we provide to first-respondents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, mainly JavaScript, and Google/ Zillow APIs to establish our web app and implemented the back-end data to connect the user's searches to the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a challenging time successfully connecting the front-end to the back-end server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are most proud of the back-end data that supports our web app and the google maps API that we implemented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that connecting the back end server to the front end server takes longer than we had expected and is more tedious than we had expected. However, we were able to push through the first few bumps in the road and have been the right track to accomplishing our ultimate goal which is having a fully operable search tool that tailors to the user's preferences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Suitable Homes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope the future of Suitable Homes will be that it will be proficiently running and operating as a handy tool for users. Also, we hope that we can broaden the search engine to homes and shelters located internationally.
