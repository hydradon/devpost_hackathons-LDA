                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The dosage information on medicine bottles are too small for the elderly to read. Also, a lot of people have too many medicines to find the needed one quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Take a photo of dosage information on medicine bottles, convert it into bigger legible texts. Can also store the name and dosage info into your own personal database of medicines.
