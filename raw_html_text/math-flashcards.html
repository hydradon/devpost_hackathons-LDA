                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got this idea when I saw the education hackathon being put on by the Alexa team because I'm a math tutor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As of now this focuses only on testing kids addition and multiplication skills.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the game template provided by the Alexa team. I'm using Nodejs and AWS Lambda to host my backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was strictly using the template and was making my code longer and harder than it needed to be. After I sat down and made a UML diagram I figured out what I was missing.
Another road block was trying to pick an operation. In the end I just used 0 and 1 to pick the operation and didn't have to add any more intents as expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this really quickly.
I learned more nodejs.
I think the kids I tutor will also find this really cool.
Got the skill to do more than just multiplication
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to handle responses to Alexa oppose to just stating facts. I gained a deeper knowledge of handlers and how they work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Math Flashcards
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would also like to design this for the Echo Show where actual flash cards are presented visually for kids. I would also make this into a google assistant app as well.
