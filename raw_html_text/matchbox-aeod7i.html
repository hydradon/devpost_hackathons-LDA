                    Why are we here today? Meeting people, networking, working on cool stuff, coming up with new solutions we wouldn't have come up with on our own. Filling in each other's weakness.

                    Collaborations are fun. People love seeing things paired together and rivaled against each other. It's a dead-simple concept that can yield dramatic results. Sports revolve around rivalry, which are like inverse collaborations. But within that, each team members collaborates. Anyway, you get it-- these are important.
