                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's 2020! People plan to travel to Mars and you still carry your wallets/phones for shopping?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You literally don't need any material/devices to pay for your shopping anymore. Just pay with your fingerprint with a simple one-time registration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An App is built and is connected to a fingerprint reader which the shopkeepers will be having. Users can register themselves and link their bank account with a simple one-time registration and don't worry about forgetting your wallet or phones for payment ever again.
