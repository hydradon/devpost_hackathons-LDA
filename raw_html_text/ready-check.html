                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Conducting verbal ready checks and realizing the potential for a mobile app to simplify.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows users to group up and conduct ready checks. A ready check is where each user is asked the basic question - are you ready? Each user then says yes - I am ready, or no - I am not ready. After each user is polled, a message is sent out that simply says "Go", to notify each user that the group is ready.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because the question is so vague, the meaning is left up to each group of users to decide. You could be asking if they're ready for a car pool in the morning, or ready for your evening workout with friends. What is normally a repetitive tedious messaging thread of asking these simple question is now simplified into a robust, easy, and real-time mobile app.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android and firebase. Specifically firebase real-time database and cloud messaging.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Setting up a node.js server to run push notifications to notify users that do not have the app open that a ready check is active.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing a very large project in roughly 10 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That we're not designers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ready Check
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Further development to make push notifications quicker and more efficient. Enhancing the UI/UX so it doesn't look like garbage. More preferences to a group (changing group name, permissions for each user in a group, etc).
