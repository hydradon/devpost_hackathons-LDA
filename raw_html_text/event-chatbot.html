                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As travelers, we have often experienced the pain of arriving at a new place and not knowing about the events around us. For this reason, we wanted a way to harness the ecosystem of events at our fingertips and find the ones most relevant to us, regardless of where we are. Knowing the power of location-related services such as Google Maps, which can be accessed remotely from our phones, we set out to build a product capable of doing the same for discovering events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a Google Assistant chatbot that takes the user's location and returns the list of all Eventbrite events starting within an hour within a specific radius.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google's Dialogflow API to handle the hosting as well as the Google Assistant integration. This calls a NodeJS module that pulls events from the Eventbrite API, which is displayed in Google Assistant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially attempted to integrate with Facebook events and Messenger. This was not possible due to the recent Facebook policy update. For that reason, we switched to Eventbrite for event integration and Google Assistant for the chatbot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to learn and integrate multiple APIs into our project in a span of under 24 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use the Eventbrite and Dialogflow public APIs.
                </p>

                    What's next for Event Chatbot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More options for users to interact with the chatbot and customize the returned list of events, such as a filtering system.
