                    While sitting around, trying to figure what in the hell we were gonna build, one of our friends decided to throw his water bottle on the ground. When questioned about this, he responded that he could not find a trash can. This gave us the amazing idea to build an app that tracks the location of trash cans to reduce these occurrences.

                <p>
                    The app tracks your location and has a database full of user supplied GPS coordinates of trash cans. When the user opens the map their location and the location of any know trash cans within 100 meters are overlaid onto the map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built the app using android studio and java. Our database is a mysql database and we use php to query the data and return it to the app. We also use the Google Maps API to provide a map of the users location and allow us to plot the trash cans on it. The phones built in GPS is used to acquire the users location.

                    Many challenges were encountered on this brave journey. The largest one was dealing with multiple java threads which is required when using PHP to query the database. Another big challenge was figuring out how to implement the Google Maps API into the app layout and view.

                    Our group is really proud of how much we learned. As we all tried to work with something that we had never done before which was very fun but also frustrating. Our group also got somewhat of a late start, so we are excited that we achieved a finished product for SpartaHack

                    There are some features that we did not have time to implement in their full capacity. So there's some more work to do be done if we decide to continue the project.
