                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole inspiration came from the fact that jailbroken iPhone filters allow you to add a "Now Playing" filter to your snapchats. This made us realize that there was a bit of a vacuum of simple apps that even allowed music editing, much less a filter that shows what you're listening to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to send in video, and audio trim the video, and select the part of music that you want to play at (where audio is automatically trimmed to the video length) . After this is decided, we mix both tracks down and put them at a location easily accessible for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fully built with Android Studio with the help of the FFmpeg binary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing the FFmpeg binary into this program was definitely a wall for our development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The above mentioned wall was taken down after a software reset halfway through (thanks DriveVaccine), and we are a lot closer to a finished product than anticipated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Design in Android can definitely be time consuming
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Today's Track
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A completion of all the features and support for users to sync their spotify music.
