                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our journey to HackNY, we came across some street artists who were very talented, but probably didn't get a chance to make it big. We decided to build an application which promotes and supports local artists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile application displays curated videos by the local artists, where the user can follow their favorite artists and get all the updates regarding their upcoming performances. The artists create their page where people can follow them and they can broadcast information regarding their upcoming shows. Moreover, the users can also make donations to the artists to support and encourage them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using react-native on the frontend which basically provides us with mobile applications for both iOS and Android devices.  On the server side, we used the Python programming language, Django framework, backed by Sqlite database to create the REST APIs which are consumed by the mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the major challenge we ran into was navigation in the react-native application. The navigation part of the react-native library isn't one of the best out there and we had to struggle to make it work smoothly. We tried integrating GoLang with MongoDB, but ran into some integration challenges and as neither of us were quite familiar with GoLang, we decided to switch to Python, Django with SQLite database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built an application with react-native when we didn't have experience with it. It was a steep learning curve, learning and building a react-native application was a little troublesome considering we aren't great at React either :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Of course React-Native! Components, Props and States. Also, we did plenty of debugging getting the react-native app to run on native android phone on an Ubuntu machine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Street-Notes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Will probably keep working on it as we were quite happy with react-native and the ability to build applications quickly.
