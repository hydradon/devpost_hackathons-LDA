                    For many, searching the internet for the perfect doctor can be frustrating and time-wasting as it can take a various number of clicks on google to find the right one for you. Therefore, we designed Doctor Schmoctor, an app designed to help people find the right doctor for them at the fingertips in just seconds. The app categorizes doctors into categories such as dentists, orthodontists, ophthalmologists, and pediatricians. From there, the user clicks their needed doctor and a list of the best doctors in the area are presented to them. The user can scroll through the names of many renowned doctors without having to open up an unbearable amount of tabs. After the user clicks on the doctor that they wish to look in to, they will be presented with their name, gender, speciality, level of education, office address, office phone number, and a photo of the doctor themselves. In addition, they will be given answers to general questions that are looked into by those doctors themselves. We built the app using a platform called XCode. The language that we used was Swift. A challenge we ran into was linking one view controller to another. However, we were able to do it. It was a learning accomplishment for us. Another challenge we ran into was time. If we had more time, we believe that we would've been able to finish. Some future improvements for Doctor Schmoctor would be to have the user be able to enter in their location and display very results based on the location. In addition, we would include a chat box that would connect the user with the reception desk at the doctor's office, which would allow the user to book appointments online and ask basic questions regarding insurance, fees, and services offered at the doctor's office. Furthermore, adding onto the chatbox, we would have an appointment booking calendar that would allow the user to book appointments with the doctor based on the urgency of the appointment.
