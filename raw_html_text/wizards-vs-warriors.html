                    Combat games are notoriously fun on any console. But what if you could enhance them further? What if you could play an rpg/ combat game in the real world, using wearable technology and smart-phones? That is what our application hopes to achieve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two users, either "wizards" (equipped with muse) or "warriors" (equipped with pebble), engage in a fun combat game that pits one player's ability to concentrate, as measured by the muse, against another player's physical strength, as measured by a pebble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea is to provide a fun and interactive game experience for people to share. It could someday evolve into a large-scale rpg-multiplayer set in the real world and enhanced by smartphones and wearable technology.
