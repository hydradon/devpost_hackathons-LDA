                <p>
                    Music developers and hobbyists need a seamless audio-editing tool. Much of the music industry's current software requires hours clicking through a complex GUI, which can be difficult to navigate, especially for those wishing to simply touch up their tracks. The need for a more organic audio-editing software has compelled us at FruitFarm team to develop JuiceBox.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JuiceBox delivers audio-editing in the medium most familiar to music developers: sound. Musicians and hobbyists alike can spend more time in developing their passions in music, thanks to JuiceBox minimizing the technical overhead.

                    Ideally, this could grow to a fully voice-integrated music editing system, where someone could walk around their room and say things like "hmm... add some more bass to the third measure" or sing a tune and have that transcribed into a motif in the music. Being able to remove yourself from a computer screen and just
                    <em>

                    the music will allow artists to be inspired by their environment and fully harmonize with their creativity.
