                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tired of always having to open up a different app just to figure out what the weather or time is in another city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses the openweathermap api, maps.google api and stdlib's slackbot integration to determine the time and weather in other cities using a slackbot. Also has a pretty neat feature for people who love SpaceX and rockets in general.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Looked up tutorials on using stdlib and its slack functionality. As well as researching the format openweathermap api and map.google api accept inputs and return outputs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ran into quite a few errors that are typical with api's, such as format issues for the inputs and outputs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It works just the way we planned!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use stdlib, openweathermap api , and maps.google api to create useful chatbots.

                <p>
                    Have Elon Musk add our bot to the SpaceX Slack workspace, so they can use the /spacex slash command
