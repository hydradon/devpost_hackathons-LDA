                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>  Music is arguably the most powerful thing in the world. It can change millions, opening eyes and relating personal experiences to others globally. But sometimes, we need to find "that song." The track that keeps you happy, the song that soothes you into a deep sleep, the single that you just can't get rid of. With MoodDJ, music can really come to life. It starts with a clean, lightweight interface, which can run on virtually any modern computer. A simplistic radio button selection enables quick switching between moods, artists, and the MoodDJ exclusive list, "The Kitchen Sink," with handpicked favorites by the creators. Selecting one of the options and continuing plays a random song from your selected choice, which is great for music discovery. You can find new beats to love, along with familiar tracks from your favorite artists. And because it integrates seamlessly with your default music player, you can treat MoodDJ's selections like regular tracks, meaning if your player supports it, you can save and add songs to playlists and grow your library. MoodDJ is built of Python 3.7, with the modules tkinter and webbrowser, which contributed for the GUI and file executing, respectively. Creating new errors in python is difficult, yet feasible if try to fix everything hard enough. The migrating between Python 2 and Python 3 syntax's were the most taxing, with entire sites hosting outdated content. The Coca-Cola induced rages led to many angry keyboard bangs and angry comments. The fact that this is the first time we ever coded in Python and it works fairly well. I am proud of our two-person team for pulling through. You can create errors in Python that didn't exist beforehand. We were proud for some reason making a mistake everyone else was smart enough to not make. Online music storage, ordering by artist and album, and cleaner GUI are all in future beta and alpha planning stages.
