                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Approximately 1/3 of the food in North America is thrown away. This exposes a huge issue with our relationship with food, and as university students, we thought of how we can make a contribution towards a more sustainable and healthy lifestyle. We personally have prepared food and have left it in the fridge for too long, which brought us to the idea behind Freshify.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app tracks leftovers to help plan meals while making sure that food does not go to waste. Our idea is currently manifested in an android app. However, in the future we will build out our product for universal device compatability.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    Freshify was built using Android Studio for both back end and front end development.
