                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are constantly surrounded by news and media regarding how our world is spiraling into its demise, while we are powerless to save it. However, we believe that if everyone made even a small contribution, we could drastically reduce our collective carbon footprint on the Earth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After filling out a brief questionnaire, the user is given a "score" that represents their impact on the environment. By taking on various tasks, the user could gradually reduce their score, and can track their progress with a variety of graphs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the project in Android Studio, which revolves around the coding languages of Java and XML. For this project, we also made use of a library called Graph View, which allowed us to generate a variety of graphs in order to allow the user to visualize their progress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us have never used Android Studio before, so it was a challenge to become accustomed to the interface, as well as getting used to the layout of the platform. Furthermore, for the majority of us, this was our first time developing an Android application, so we had to vigorously reference and review the documentation for the Java language in Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application, in our opinion, was very polished in terms of functionality and front-end design. We managed to cooperate together in the making of this app, despite not knowing each other before this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Android Studio to develop Android applications, and became accustomed to the XML language when designing apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sunrise
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to fine-tune our algorithm to more accurately predict the user's impact on the environment, and also plan to possibly expand on the variety of "tasks" the user can take on in the future.
