                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this application because of our own experiences with looking for jobs for our next co-op term. One of the major aspects in the hiring process are interviews which can be daunting to prepare for, but with a mobile app to practice some common questions on, job-searchers can feel much more prepared! With Cali || Bust, your Cali dreams don't have to be a BUST!

                <p>
                    Cali || bust takes your resume and using Google Cloud Vision and Google Cloud NLP APIS, develops customized  interview questions tailored to you based on your experience and skills!. Then based on these interview questions you are able to record yourself answering these questions, allowing you to critique your own interviewing skills!

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the project with literal blood, sweat, and tears (one of our team members got a papercut). After that, we used two google cloud APIs (Google Cloud Vision and Google Cloud Language Processing) and returned their results using React Native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going into the hackathon, none of us knew how to use React Native but we ended up using it because it is one of the most powerful languages for developing mobile applications, being able to compile natively to both Android and iOS. Furthermore, integrating the Google Cloud APIs in the new React Native environment was especially difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of first years, we are honestly extremely proud to even have thought of an idea let alone developed it in 24 hours! We're super proud that we were able to develop both the front-end design and API calls and integrate them together to make a functioning application!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about the developing process, and all the different aspects of design and business that go into software development as well. Having roles within the team environment is so incredibly important to maximize productivity in 24 hours.
