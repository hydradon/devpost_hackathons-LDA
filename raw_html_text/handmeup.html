                <p>
                    Food givers can register to give food through our site, and can easily submit food lists and view previous delivery requests. To keep from biased and selective sending, the food givers do not know the exact drop-off location through this site. Food receivers can enter their organization's information to be the recipient of these deliveries. This data is written to a database, and the mobile app reads this and sends nearby and open deliveries to the volunteers, who can accept and easily navigate between the two locations.

                    Editing the app is a bit complicated. First you need npm and Cordova, and you need to install the Ionic framework. It is much easier to run on the command line, but you can also run Ionic applications using the
