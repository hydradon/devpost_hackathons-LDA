                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To make finding a new restaurant near you easy. We wanted an mobile website that allows users the simplicity of finding a restaurant.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tender is a mobile friendly website that does not bombard users with many places at once. One restaurant is shown at a time and the user either likes it or dislikes it. This is similar to the very popular dating app, tinder.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Tender with a fusion of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript/jQuery, Bootstrap, and Google Places API. For design/animation we used HTML5 and CSS3 with Bootstrap. Bootstrap allowed for a fully responsive framework so that we didn't waste time making a mobile version of the app. For all of the web application portion, we used Javascript/jQuery for user interaction and getting data from the Google Place API for restaurants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenges we ran into were accessing the data from the API and manipulating whatever was available into a clean user interface. We attempted to make an Android app but soon realized it would be a waste of time with the already responsive website. Another challenge we ran into was laying out information on a responsive panel, as there was issues with overlapping content. We were able to get some help and quickly recover.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of creating a fully functional web application that solves the problem of finding a place to eat quickly and efficiently. We were able to keep the design clean while not removing any features due to limitations. We were able to stay confident and complete all our goals for the project.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the value of teamwork, and how it can help to facilitate nearly everything when it comes to development and production of a software (or anything really). We all learned a lot about Javascript and it's behaviors throughout the development and plan to expand our knowledge when it comes to JS.

                <p>
                    Branching out to delivery services, get more data to be as accurate as possible.
