                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever written a script only to realize that you structured your functions wrong? Or maybe you are trying to troll twitch chat and you wanted to step your meme game up? All that copy pasting is time consuming and like all programmers, we're lazy. So we decided to create a clipboard manager that would give us the ability to copy and paste many different items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Essentially ClipBook allows you to save your clipboard to a list for later use. Each list, called a chapter, can store up to ten elements. In ClipBook you can make as many chapters as the user wants to switch between. Through keyboard shortcuts ClipBook allows the user to save their current clipboard to a chapter for later use, copying an item from a chapter to your clipboard, and switching between chapters. There is a GUI where you can view what each chapter contains. The GUI also allows the user to manually add items to chapters, remove items from chapters, and also switch between chapters.

                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coding in python we utilized pyperclip, pyHook, and JSON encoding.

                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing global windows hotkeys and event listeners took a while to get working. How we stored our lists evolved from storing each list in an individual text document to JSON encoding of data.

                    Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hotkeys with event listeners and GUI functionality.

                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python has lots of very useful libraries that we can use to do a lot of work for us. We expanded upon our knowledge of GUI's.

                    Data encryption, cloud saving, and copying more formatting.
