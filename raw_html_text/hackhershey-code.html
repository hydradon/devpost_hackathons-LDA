                    Inspiration came from the impossible challenges.

                    This adventure is programmed to challenge a players hand-eye coordination in an almost impossible sort of way.

                    I built it with the website Scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was challenged to figure out a solution to a dialogue timing issue. I resolved this by coding to paths, where the sprit moves on one and repeats dialogue once on another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was able to create a backup code for my team when a small chunk of our code was lost. I was able to resolve multiple issues pertaining to dialogue and gameplay mechanics. In a span of five hours, I was able to finish the introduction, complete the first challenge, make a list of missions, and create a Game Over screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I learned that some problems need a backup plan. Even though I learned a lot from QBasic, most of my skills went to Scratch, creating a backup plan if our original backfired.
