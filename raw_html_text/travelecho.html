                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With our poor senses of direction and our inability to plan, we decided to build TravelEcho to help ensure your future travels go as smooth as possible and that you are fully prepared for all occasions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TravelEcho is an Amazon Echo skill that helps plan your trips and events by asking for destinations and gives you accurate weather information or attractions near by. It tells you accurate weather data and with that data tells you what clothing to bring.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon web services to host the servers and code needed to create this brand-new skill. The code within is made possible with Node.js while incorporating Google maps and weather APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into multiple bugs as we built our skill. Our code would often have small errors that prevented our code from working properly. We had to debug the entire program to fix the problem of parsing the Google Maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our ability to plan effectively ensured that we kept a tight schedule. This ensured that we were able to work effectively throughout the 24 hours and with our remaining time we were able to fix our 2 main bugs of location and weather recognition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team we learned how to code a new language and the inner workings of the Amazon Echo system.
Further more we learned how to apply our knowledge from other programming applications into the Amazon Echo. We learned Node.Js, Amazon web server, and more in depth about different types of APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TravelEcho
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next step is to make the application more user friendly, and to be able to ask for user feedback on the destinations that we recommended. We will also build in software that understands multiple languages for international travelers that come into Canada.
