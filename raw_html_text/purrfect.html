                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Losing your pet is a very emotionally draining experience. Presently there is no dedicated forum for finding lost pets or reporting stray animals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People who find stray/pet animals can upload pictures of the animal along with their personal information so that the owners/foster homes can contact them and take their pets back.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python's Django Framework to build the backend and frontend of the web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding the correct framework to connect backend to frontend. We wanted to use PHP for this application, but we thought of developing data visualizations which are more interactive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn Django framework and deliver a solution which might help a lot of lost animals to reach back home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how things which appear daunting at the beginning have a very simple solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Purrfect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, we can deploy Geo location-based interactive map to find lost pets, derive insights regarding lost pets across the states in the US and enable a peer to peer lost animal reporting system.
