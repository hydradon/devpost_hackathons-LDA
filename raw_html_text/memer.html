                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a few months now, I've been thinking about building an irc bot that just posts memes. Originally at Hoyahacks I was planning to demonstrate bluetooth penetration, but I didn't have the right equipment, so this was sort of a back up in a way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the command ".meme" is said in the irc channel, memer calls an api to get a meme image, then translates it into ascii characters and outputs it (many times 20-30 lines) to the irc chat window.
When the command ".trump" is said, memer fetches a random tweet out of the past 20 made by Donald Trump.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm decent with python, so I found sopel, a python based irc bot right away to get started.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By far the inconsistencies in python between archlinux(my dev machine) and ubuntu(my cloud machine) was the most frustrating part, since ubuntu defaults to python 2 but archlinux defaults to python 3. I also expected the apis to be difficult, but a python library called tweeby came in clutch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before I evern started building this bot, I worked for almost a day straight on trying to intercept and read bluetooth packets. I eventually captured the traffic into wireshark, but couldn't read it due to encryption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for the irc bot, I've never built or dealt with automating irc, so it proved to be quite interesting to discover that it is actually pretty easy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The night I began Hoyahacks, I barely knew anything about bluetooth sniffing &amp; packet capture, but by the end I could tell you what a bluetooth device broadcasts, how it broadcasts, and how to intercept the traffic.
I also discovered that the new Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is significantly less secure and is thus much easier to hack that earlier bluetooth technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Memer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'll plan to keep adding random entertaining things to the irc bot as an ongoing side project, but I mainly want to focus on the improvement of bluetooth sniffing and packet capture. I could barely find any research in this area, which is one of the main reasons I want to help develop it.
