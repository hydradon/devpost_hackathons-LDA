                </h2>
                <p>
                    A common issue in the recruitment process is the lack of feedback from employer to applicant. This prevents the applicant from being able to learn from their errors and improve their applications in the future. Reasons for the lack of feedback from employers include the finite amount of time they have to spend on recruitment, worries that providing negative feedback may turn into a difficult conversation, and fear that candidates will ask for further advice regarding interviewing and job searching.

                <p>
                    Our web application and Android application together provide a mechanism for quick, anonymous, and non-confrontational feedback from employer to applicant.

                    We built our system using Android for our mobile app, and React, Html, and CSS for our web app. We used Firebase as our database and authentication system.

                <p>
                    That we were able to turn the idea into an actual working product (including idea, design, coding, testing) within 24 hours. As well, accomplishing real-time integration between our mobile and web apps.

                    Various additional ways for the employer to provide feedback to the applicant, including editing tools for resumes (which would aid both the employer in taking notes, and the applicant in receiving detailed feedback).
