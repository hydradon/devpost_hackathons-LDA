                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An alarm clock has no respect for it&rsquo;s user -- fact. No matter what an alarm clock will go off at the time you set it to. We were tired of waking up feeling groggy, clouded, and sad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are three main stages of sleep: light sleep, deep sleep, and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. Depending on the stage one is in during sleep, interruptions may have a varying impact on cognition, awakeness, and mood. Namely, being interupted up in REM sleep can lead to grogginess, ability to concentrate, and consolidating information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By tracking heart rate from a sensor worn by the user, our application monitors important sleep cycles (in light sleep heart BPM is relatively low, in REM sleep heart rate is high). Once the user&rsquo;s heart rate changes to the light sleep window, the alarm clock knows to send a Twilio call to the user&rsquo;s phone, at the time the user configured the alarm. The alarm call gives a pleasant &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; message, the time, and a song.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the information is made available in a web application so that the user may view previous sleep cycles, average bpm, and information about your medical provider, in the case that further analysis on how the user is sleeping is needed.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rise-N-Shine is built on several different technologies, including: Flask, twilio, Arduino, serial, Celery, matplotlib, numpy, bootstrap, button, and flot.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working with serial signal input from the heartbeat sensor, integrating the SQLite database, flot charts, bootstrap templates.
                </p>

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SQL Database implementation, bootstrap configurations, things about sleep (should probably get more of it)
