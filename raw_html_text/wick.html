                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The insecurity we live everyday when walking in the streets, either you're alone or in company, also the empathy with our family, friends or any person that has been in a difficult situation due to the lack of security we have to live with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the user is in a emergency situation it will activate an alarm installed in your backpack, sending the location and a 15 seconds video to the emergency contacts selected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Mini Spy Camera, push buttons and GPS Module(ublox neo 6M) are connected to the Raspberry using the protocols described in their data sheets. We programmed a client and server in Python using socket, in order to transfer files between them. We use Swift to program the iOS app with Xcode IDE, using the MapKit, AVKit, AVFoundation, UIKit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought using the DragonBoard 410c, but it has a lack of documentation, and also the signal of its GPS module was not efficient for our purpose. So we ended up using the Raspberry pi 3 b and using the GPS Module ublox Neo 6M.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The succesful implementation of the GPS in the app, and also the way we could communicate, sending and receiving files. Not forgetting that we were able to record and save videos and photos with the Mini Spy Camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The correct configuration of the the Mini Spy Camera, the GPS Module that we didn't even knew it existed. Also the use of the MapKit library of apple. And how to stablish a communication between computers via socket.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Wick
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve the capacities of the software, its communication with the clients and the security. Also to improve the app so we can give a better experience to the users. The design and different models for backpacks. To reduce costs by making efficient the power and making better the connections.
