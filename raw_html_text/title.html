                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project works to automatically match mentors and mentees that have a high percentage of similarities with one another. A mentee with receive the top mentors that fit their goals and interests, and from there, the mentee will be able to manually chose between those top suggested mentors to see which one they want to work with the most.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using InteliJ and coded it in Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part of the program was trying to figure out how to connect our results from a Google Sheet together with the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An accomplishment we're proud of is that we did find a way to connect our Google Sheets to our java program, but it took significantly longer than we anticipated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how time-consuming and difficult it is to create a professional program for another person or company, and we also learned how to work together in teams such that we can support one another and improve on our project.
