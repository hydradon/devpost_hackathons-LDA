                    Introducing the Stress-inator. Come de-stress with your virtual stress assistant Hans, who is designed to be actively aware of you through your actions. If you show signs of auditory stress through sighs or smashing of tables, Hans will be there to help you relieve stress. Through color therapy, Hans will interact and illuminate colors to sooth your soul.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Explore hidden features by trying new buttons, sensors, and much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Try you "Hans" at dealing with stress.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For our software, we programmed the Stress-inator through the Arduino IDE (ver 1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our hardware, we used the base shield, and grove kit components: push buttons, LEDs, touch sensor, rotary sensor, Piezo vibration sensor, and sound sensor.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since both of us are amateur Arduino users, we needed to explore Arduino's abilities and went through trial and error to create each new feature of the Stress-inator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also timing... The bane of our existence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even through the timing aspect of the Arduino difficult to understand, we found that delays helped smooth out our bugs with timing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Stress-inator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A nice nap before out next iteration which will include more sensors and more interactions with Hans, your virtual stress assistant.
                </p>

                    Q: What is the problem you&rsquo;re solving?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: Stress is an issue that all people face in any period of their life. Stress comes in many forms and is usually alleviated by pulling focus away from the pressing issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q: Who are users and/or customers?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: Hans is user-friendly for all ages. Anyone who feels stress can come de-stress with Hans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Q:What&rsquo;s currently missing that they need and which your solution provides?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: Hans provides fun interactive activities that require you to poke around with his sensors to explore new ways to de-stress. With Hans, you will be curious to find new features, but don't let that stress you either.
