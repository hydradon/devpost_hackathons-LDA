                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jessie, one of our team mates, came up with the concept as a plausible idea; something we could all accomplish.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MicDropBot takes sentence structures that we designed and plugs in random words from a set list.  We designed it to make inspiring or amusing sentences, and then posts them to twitter.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The code was built in Python, using Tweepy and the Twitter API.  We gathered words and separated them by part of speech and rhyme and put them into separate text documents.  The code is hosted by Amazon Lambda.  Design for the twitter page was created with adobe illustrator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into this project with limited Python knowledge and no set resources, we had several problems.  A major issue was trying to categorize words both by part of speech and by rhyme.  It was also a struggle to find an interesting word list to begin with- we ended up making our own.  Hosting the bot on its own and having it post autonomously was also new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the program to fetch words both by rhyme and part of speech, getting sentence structures that didn't sound awkward, designing a marketable twitter profile.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Python, hosting, the English language, and working in a team!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for MicDropBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to have MicDropBot take data input when people tweet at it.  It would also be fun to host MicDropBot on a website other than Twitter, so we could do more with him.
