                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We saw a cool visualization of Venmo paper-trail data and decided to use Capital One's Nessie API to simulate customer behavior and purchasing decisions with hierarchical Bayesian modeling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simulates and generates data about customers and which types of products they purchase. Analyzes data and uses LDA clustering to rediscover the underlying connections between different merchants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Capital One's Nessie API in Python to write a variety of functions for adding and measuring purchases between customers and merchants. Using the random module in num.py, we generated purchase data. We then used the gensim package to fit the data. Finally, we used d3.js in Javascript to create visualizations of the purchase data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no data, so we had to figure out a reasonable model for simulating interesting and realistic data.
Improving runtime when processing large amounts of data was also a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing functions for generating random names of people and of stores
Creating realistic results that measure the connectedness between merchants
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained a better understanding of scripting in Python and writing modules between a variety of different data types. We also learned a lot about interactive data visualization in Javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Nessie Vis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd love to apply our model to a real data set and showcase some discoveries about real-world customers and merchants!
