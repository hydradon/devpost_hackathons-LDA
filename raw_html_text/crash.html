                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We play many games which were fun, so we thought of what made a game fun. A game that looked professional and never-ending.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An android game where we touch left or right part of the screen to control a 3-d car. The obstacles set on the terrain are meant to be avoided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unity and c#
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interface was confusing and it was hard for all of us to work on the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no clue of how to use c# or unity so it was interesting to figure out how to program and make a simulation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned  game development and how to use unity to build an android game.
                </p>

                    What's next for Crash!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't have enough time to finish the game.(Where the car should stop when it hits and obstacle)
