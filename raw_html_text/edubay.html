                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you're browsing the web and see something you're interested in but don't want to stop reading, you can eBayify it to make your web browsing and consuming experience even more efficient.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right clicking and eBayifying a section of text will highlight the key phrases of the text and generate real time eBay links for the important phrases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed our own chrome extension using JavaScript ES6, CSS, and HTML. To find the key phrases of the text, we used a Microsoft Azure Text Analytics API. We also then used an eBay API to generate the product links.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communicating between different js files. This was especially difficult in getting the extension and popup to work together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of making our first chrome extension, as well as having a nice product that works to show. We also think it's pretty cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sharpened our skills in JavaScript, and learned how to develop a Google Chrome Extension. Additionally, we learned a lot about the development process as a whole, especially how frustrating it is when the code isn't working really close to the deadline.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for eBayify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We also have plans on expanding eBayify to incorporate selling items through the Chrome Extension.
