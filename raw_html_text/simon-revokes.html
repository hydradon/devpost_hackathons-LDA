                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can't count how many times I've been sitting idly and started tapping or humming away. This is my own personal way of tapping idly in a more musical way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simon Suppresses is a simple concept, a series of tiles on a black background that play different notes when pressed. However, for those musically inclined, you can change keys, play accidentals, and shift up and down by half steps. It truly is the musician's musical toy.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using PyAudio as well as the graphics module
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Playing Accidentals without the use of multi-threading was my biggest challenge, although I think the work around in place manages to preserve the fluidity of the program
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teaching myself all of python graphics in under 2 hours, and the math required to increase and decrease by octaves and half steps
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only did I learn about python graphics and the math behind sound waves, my music theory knowledge increased at every step of the process
                </p>

                <p>
                    An ios app and multi-touch support are currently in the works
