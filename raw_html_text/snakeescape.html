                    We are table 14 by the way.
Our website is supposed to be a  get-away from pressure sort of website. There are literally tons of apps helping people -particularly students be on top of their studies or work, so we thought why not create something to ease the break free process ?! It's actually our first time ever doing web dev so we opted for a template at first, but it took us AGES to tailor every single line of code !! We wanted then to use an api so that when the user chooses one sort of destination, the website connects to google places API to collect information about all nearby attractions matching that destination type. We went through some tutorials and managed to use the API but we could not parse JSON on javascript so it ended up a bit basic! Quite proud of how far we learned though!
