                    Well, that's quite simple...
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should pick the last multiple of 2 from the ammount of people in the circle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first will always be removed when the ammount of people is equals a multiple of 2...
when the number of people is one more than a multiple of 2, the third will be removed, always the odds, exactly on that order...
                </p>
                <p>
                    eg:
                </p>
                <p>
                    71 people
                </p>
                <p>
                    last multiple of two is 64.
                </p>
                <p>
                    when I subtract 64 from 71 I will have 7 people... so I will multiply by two = 14
now we only need to add one to convert from programmer numbers to human numbers...
                </p>
                <p>
                    14+1 = the 15&ordm; person on the circle will be removed.
                </p>
