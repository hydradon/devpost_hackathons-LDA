                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As both Presidents of two student organizations at FIU SCIS, and students who are actively doing technical interview prep through the semester, we saw a real need for this application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students always ask us for resources, who they can practice with, what they should practice, etc. So many people struggle with access to a limited network, managing schedules, finding people that are interested in the topics they need to practice, finding someone at a similar skill level, among other factors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Therefore we decided to provide students a solution bringing you "I want to CODE with somebody". This application allows you to find other programmers like yourself who are looking to do interview prep, without spending hundreds and thousands of hours or dollars looking for online resources or paying for interviews.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our matching process would pair you with another programmer to go through mock interviews for the role you're interested in, based on education level, practice topics you're interested in, your programming level, availability and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After filling out a simple quiz upon registration, you will be matched with programmers like yourself to prepare to Ace Your Interview. We have seen other competitors out there, but we didn't find one that provided in person real-time mock interviews and whiteboard meetups, customized to your preference. This application also focuses on tracking gender and ethnicity to provide benefits in the future to underrepresented communities.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using Android Studio, programming in Android and Java. The database is Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting Android to Firebase. Generating authentication token for the login.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us have ever worked with Android Studio, so we're excited we were able to complete as much as we did, and hope to keep adding functionalities in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make an Android app!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for I want to CODE with Somebody
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to perfect the matching algorithm, add a calendar invite, cancellation and rescheduling or upcoming meetings, a feedback system from previous mock interviews so you can gauge your progress, a problem generator and lots more.
