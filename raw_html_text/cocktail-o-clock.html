                    Cocktail mixing is fun but also as an amateur mixologist, you're not always sure what goes in or how is the cocktail supposed to look like. This Alexa skill helps you to prepare the most recognized and IBA approved cocktails by telling you the ingredients and the step-by-step recipe. If your Echo device has a display, also shows you the reference outcome so you could be sure you're doing it right. It makes the process of creating a cocktail a more certain and enjoyable experience.
