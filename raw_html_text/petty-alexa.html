                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PetSmart wouldn't sell us a shock collar, so we decide that a personal assistant would be the next best way to get a messy roommate to clean up his act.

                    Petty Alexa, or Alex for short, is designed to build good living habits through degradation, intimidation, ridicule, and bloodcurdling shrieking. The perfect tool for any college freshman still confused about the finer points of living independently, she comes with a repository of instructions about tasks from microwaving ramen to what to do when you don't feel well. The chassis is also a built-in pile sensor, allowing you to track the number of clothes in your hamper or manage the dishes in the sink, making sure that you know that they need to be attended to.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Alexa skill suite was created using the development tools provided by Amazon. We combed through the internet for the best instructions and hard-coded those responses. While the dining function scrapes the web for different RIT dining locations and stores them in a database. The level sensor was constructed using an Arduino 101 and a Grove Base Shield.
