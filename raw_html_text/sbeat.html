                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College is often compared to a petri dish&mdash; like the exponential growth of bacteria, diseases are easily and quickly transmitted. With thousands of students fitted in close living quarters, diseases are easily spread without proper prevention.
As you may know, modern college students suffer from a wide variety of self-care related issues: drinking, substance abuse, mental health, sleep deprivation, just to name a few. With the things students would do to achieve academic proficiency, it is shocking how unwilling they are at the risk of their own health. With the things students would do to achieve academic proficiency, it is shocking how unwilling they are at the risk of their own health.
We drew inspiration from this issue. In light of the lack of self-care, we started Student Beat, a website that collects information on the user&rsquo;s various symptoms, categorizes and predicts several common diseases. It then provides the user with easy, immediate home remedies, tailored to busy college students.

                    S Beat collects information on the user&rsquo;s various symptoms and uses this to categorize and predict which of the common college campus illnesses the student may have.  Each sickness within our database is accompanied with easy, immediate home remedies and clear steps of action&mdash;all of which are tailored for college students.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By implementing GitHub and Atom (an adaptive workspace), we began by building each individual webpage in html. Using this code as a basis, we expanded on it with CSS, adding our company logo and other designs to each page. The website also features a Google sign in feature. Throughout the weekend, each member of our group worked on sections of our website. At the end, we were able to put it together and produce a product that we are proud of.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since our team knew very little about code, one of the greatest challenges we ran into involved learning how to code along the way. A lot of our team&rsquo;s 36 hours was spent getting the hang of things with trial and error, which we soon realized could be quite a frustrating process. Adjusting to Atom and struggling to settle on and learn a language that we were going to to code our system with gave us the most trouble. We came across several instances where we weren&rsquo;t sure what to do next, and it was easy to feel discouraged. However, it was an enjoyable experience to learn html (and bits of CSS and Javascript).

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team of diverse majors (materials engineering, biomed, graphic communications, and chemistry), we nevertheless shared a common interest to learn and explore CS at our first hackathon. We are proud to have encountered, hands-on, the step-by-step process of building a website. We are all proud to have learned an amazing amount within the last 36 hours.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code html, operate Github, and test run websites on cloud platforms. We learned how to function as a team, assigning assignments and teaching one another when we could.

                    What's next for SBeat
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we are confident that we are all leaving SLO Hacks with more knowledge and practice than we came with. With this increased experience, we know we can expand SBeat with brand new features as well as improved one, too. SBeat does not cover all of the diseases commonly found in colleges, and it lacks personalization in terms of knowing what institution its user attends. We would like for it to cover a much broader basis when it comes to the diseases/sickness/injuries available for diagnosis as well as offer the option to specifically tailor your user experience alongside the Campus Health offered at your school.
