                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From napkins to diamonds, sex to soap bars, there isn't a market in existence that millennials haven't been accused of ruining, stock markets included.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While there are many reasons why one would choose not to actively participate in the stock market, we believe that a huge barrier to entry is the lack of stock market literacy. With confusing jargon and high risk, high reward behavior, from the outside, looking in, the stock market looks like an intimidating jumble of numbers with little to no explanations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stock market trading is just like a game of whack-a-mole; you hit some, you miss some. What you miss brings frustration but no immediate net gain or loss. What you hit can either win or lose you some cash (we modified our game to mimic this behavior). And moles are cuter than both bulls or bears.

                    On the home screen, there are 3 tabs. The first tab is an introduction to some common terms. The second tab shows simplified market data. The third tab features our twist on the class Whack-A-Mole.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We bootstrapped this app with create-react-app. The team members that were financially inclined implemented market analysis. Those that were not did whack-a-mole.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble with CORS while piping api data into our app, but some mentors helped us get through that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us are beginners in ReactJS, and we think it's really cool that we managed to make a somewhat functional app :)
                </p>

                    What we learned

                    React, crash course stock market, crash course whack-a-mole

                <p>
                    More detailed analysis of stock market data, better UI
