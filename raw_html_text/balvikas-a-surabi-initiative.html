                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    During our discussions with the NGOs, we were able to realise the amount of selfless effort they are putting towards the upliftment of society. We as a team strongly believe that Children from all parts of the country should be able to receive education and we were immediately able to connect to the proposal of Surabi Trust.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project comprises of 3 parts
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Student Web App - Where the students can sign up on the platform and receive course recommendations, enroll for class, chat with mentors and complete assignments
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mentor App - Where the mentors enroll on the platform , create course curriculum, conduct online classes and review assignments
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Administrator Web App - Where members of the surabi trust can review and approve members, activate/deactivate members and get a summary of the courses being conducted on the platform.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We started off with a brainstorming session with the NGO to figure out the exact requirements, and how we can build features over the said requirements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We then proceeded with the database design and Ui design in parallel to figure out the application flow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the base flow has been done, we then build the api servers with the required end points using NodeJS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then, we built the front end interface using Angular and ionic for the mobile and web interfaces
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, we tested out the end to end flow of the application to ensure that all major bugs are addressed before the final submission
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        As part of the connect program, we wanted to have a P2P video calling facility to enable the mentor and the mentee have effective conversations. However, we discovered that the PayPal Guest wifi does not allow the connection to go through over port 9000. We quickly had to figure out why this was happening and if we can come up with a fix to solve this problem
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We are proud of the fact that every single member of the team was able to contribute to this project via Design, Coding and testing the complete application
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We are also happy that we were able to come up with quick fixes for the problems that we haven't encountered before.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also came up with a new logo for the project initiative within the project time frame itself.

                    <li>
                        We were able to complete only the web app and not the mobile app for the students on time although most of the screens have been completed. The next immediate task will be to complete this flow and roll it out as well.

                        Improve the overall architecture to ensure that the server can auto-scale with load

                        Work with the NGO to analyse the usage trends of the application and come up with more features that will help improve the usability of the application
