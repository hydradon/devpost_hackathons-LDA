                    I was inspired by the Archetype Solutions Group Challenge. Essentially, what this project does is it provides the patient with the tasks they need to do for that day (ie: take medications, call the physician, etc.). For the physician, the app is MEANT to open up to an editing screen where they can change the tasks if they need to (this, unfortunately, could not be achieved in the time allotted). This webpage provides the task based off of email and password, as well as a radio button system for gender. I built this by using a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript on codepen.io. The challenges that I ran into for this were that I could not figure out how to make the passwords hidden, I could not create an alternative if "Physician" was chosen from the dropdown, and I could not program different scenarios for different emails. However, I am still proud of this as this is the first real type of programming creation I have made by myself. What I have learned is that programming takes a large amount of practice, and there are always hurdles to be overcome. The next step for this page is to develop it to meet the challenges that I could not solve, and even try creating a domain for this.
