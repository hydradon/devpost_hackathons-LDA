                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to build a fun personal finance app that targets at the Penn community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app shows on the map how much the user spends in each store in the University City. Combined with the function of setting spending and saving goals for each month, this app helps the user easily visualize their monetary activities in the University City and makes it more convenient for the users to keep up with their spending and saving goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build it with Android studio, firebase for backend and Google map API.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We keep facing different types of mysterious bugs. Sometimes we have trouble putting up individual parts together.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have successfully built the layouts of the pages, set up the color theme, and inserted a pie chart and the Google Map showing the university area. We have also built a database storing user name
