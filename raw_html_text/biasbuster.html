                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We heard about the JP Morgan Chase code for good challenge and wanted to create a project that inspires young women to go into STEM.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user shoots at different stereotypes about women and after they obtain a certain amount of points they go to the next level and receive a fact about women in STEM. As the game progresses and the user goes from one level to the next the stereotypes get worse and the game gets a little bit harder.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML5 and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some issues with debugging javascript and were not able to stop rendering to the canvas.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to use a language that we don't regularly use and make a project out of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became more familiar with how to use javascript and HTML5.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BiasBuster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could improve the graphics and have more levels, more choices for the user, and different game modes.
