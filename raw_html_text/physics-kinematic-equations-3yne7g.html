                        Struggles in the past.
                    </strong>
                    When I took AP Physics in high school I thought of it being difficult, however I did not know why I struggled on it. For some reason I did not grasp the simple content, maybe having some type of program that can show me how one can find another piece of information would be helpful and thus why I made the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you input values of variables that you actually have, the program would output the other variables that can be calculated using the kinematic equations using the information given.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of "if" statements were used due to there constantly being different situations.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The funny part was that I struggled on a simple situation, running the code but the output states that it can not load the main class.

                        That I stayed to the end of this Hackathon while having only the slightest knowledge of coding in Java, not even a computer science major.

                    One should always come prepared.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Physics Kinematic Equations
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I can continue with creating a code that would have more than just the kinematic equations to find other variables or if in case I was given more unique variables.
Another idea is to create a visualization for learners to grasp how each variable impacts another.
                    <strong>
                        The last idea I can do is ignore the Physics Kinematic Equations, start from scratch, and make something completely different.
