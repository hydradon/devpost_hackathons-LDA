                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a senior in Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering finishing up my last semester and I've realized that my time at university hasn't just prepared me for a career, it's also equipped me to help make a difference in the world. I've been lucky to meet people from all over the world through internships and a lot of them have shared my same sentiment, but there really aren't any well-designed tech volunteer platforms geared towards college students across the U.S. (as hard as it is to believe!)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In short, it lets students register and view different active projects they can work on, showcase their volunteer portfolio, connect with non-profits, and gain badges through an incentive system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mongoose and good ole' node.js...my philosophy is to keep it simple and reliable.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've never used Mongoose before, and usually at hackathons, I never really focus on the backend because there's never enough time, but this time (being my last university hackathon) I knew I had to get it done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for CodeforChange
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More students, we currently have over 50 opt-ins, and we're ready to bring in non-profits and partner with regional tech volunteer sites.
