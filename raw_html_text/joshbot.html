                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a friend that liked to be a class clown and tell a lot of jokes that would make us laugh. We decided that it would be cool and unique if we mimicked our friend using a computer. Also, who doesn't love a good joke from time to time?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a bot that keeps telling you jokes. You can rate the jokes on a 1 to 5 star scale and based on your rating, the bot will give you a joke it thinks you would like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First we set up a MySQL database and a google cloud server. After that we designed a UI and started to fill the database with jokes and their respective ratings. The algorithm to get jokes that the user would most likely enjoy came last, being developed at around 4 AM which is why it is a little iffy functionality wise...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that making the bot pick jokes the user would like was harder than we originally thought. Also, getting jokes into a database was pretty tedious and took more time than we wanted it to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the JoshBot to show a nice smooth graph about each joke. Also we made the UI very minimalistic and pleasing to look at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about JavaScript and SQL. We also learned that manually entering things to a database takes a lot of time. Lastly, we learned about what makes a wbesite appealing to look at.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for JoshBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add more jokes and maybe make it more of a chatbot. Also, we want to make the bot be able to sort through and categorize jokes.
