                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group of college students, we were inspired to create this project based on our own desire to cut down delivery fees from apps such as Postmates and Uber Eats. Often, we are unwilling to order food because we are driven away by these high prices, and we believe that Meal Plan would help save us a significant amount of money.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Meal Plan is a website that matches the user to people nearby who are also planning on ordering food from the same restaurant within a given timespan so the delivery fee can be split among the greatest number of people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used WixCode as a template to start our website in order to have nicer formatting, and we used JavaScript to add customizations to our website. Because Meal Plan also needs to know the location of the user so it can find people nearby, we used the Google Maps API to get the latitude and longitude of the user's location. For the backend, it was completely written in JavaScript. We uploaded our code to Google App Engine and accessed it from our frontend to compute all the calculations and complete all the queries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into a few challenges while connecting the frontend to the backend, especially with the use of the Google App Engine. We were also constrained a bit by the features given to us in WixCode. We wanted to directly deal with JSON outputs to integrate with the Wix dataset functionality, but this was not possible due to WixCode limitations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the website so that different users can access the same data and interact with each other. We are also proud of the overall idea for the project, as this is something that we would love to have in our lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout this project, we were able to learn a lot about the different features available in WixCode and learn a lot about JavaScript in the process. We ran into a lot of different bugs but we were able to debug most of them on our own.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Meal Plan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we want to make Meal Plan a mobile app s it can be more accessible for all of our users.
