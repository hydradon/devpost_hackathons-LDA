                    This project is based around several principles:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Two strong ridership generators are Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and the Staten Island Ferry Terminal. As such, most of my proposals centered on extending lower-ridership routes to those destinations to generate ridership from the low-ridership portion, as well as supplement busier routes.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Interstate service to New Jersey needs to be improved. We have 3 bridges to New Jersey and one to Brooklyn, yet the only route to New Jersey is a rush hour route to Bayonne.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Coverage and connectivity are improved in newly-developed neighborhoods.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Routes are structured to run more directly, and on the South Shore, they are timed with the SIR in the predominant direction of travel. SIR service is timed better with the ferry during off-peak hours (waits would be 8-10 minutes instead of 17)
                        </p>
