                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I needed a robust method to generate nonlinear control algorithms for power electronics systems.
Optimal control methodologies are limited in scope and do not work well for many applications. Something new was needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use a genetic algorithm to create a tree-based program structure. This representation is translated into C-style syntax and compiled with LLVM. The resulting function (which takes inputs and data storage parameters) is used as the control law in a simulator.
