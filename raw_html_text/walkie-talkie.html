                <p>
                    Compassion International is a non-profit organization, which connects an impoverished child with a sponsor that will stay with from early school age all the way until they are 18. Human translated letters between sponsors are kids have been the a key part of the 1:1 relationship we help children and sponsors foster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compassion International needs a solution which is more scalable and more immediate, while still protecting our children from any potential harm. Currently, this is typically done by manually reviewing all letters. They would like to add a voice strategy for connecting children to their sponsors, with near-real time translation from device to device, while also filtering out anything inappropriate for children to experience.
