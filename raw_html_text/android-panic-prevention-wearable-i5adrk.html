                    Inspiration- 40 million adults are diagnosed with panic and anxiety disorder yearly and only 36.9% receive proper treatment.

                    What it does- Android wearable responds to heart rate increase related to onset of panic/anxiety attack providing vibration therapy to initiate the reduction of the attacks symptoms and provide the user with relief.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it - It was developed in Android Studio using java coding (some adopted from Github user judeibe); Using a Motorla 360 wearable v2, and MSI laptop, Galaxy S 6 edge
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into- Pushing the application through Android studio to handheld; The wearable initially failed to respond to the heart rate trigger and panic button immediately changed heart rate to unrealistic numbers; Sleep deprivation; Lacking more programmers for the project to extend the applications potential to include more data collection and application intuitive growth.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of- We completed the introductory portion of the application development which included the response to trigger target on heart rate as well as fully functional panic button with a functional reset button to kill the vibration therapy. We feel we presented our project with in he given time, clearly and concisely.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned- Research the event deeper than we did to determine the requirements of participants for maximum effectiveness. We should have composed the team with more computer science members.

                    What's next for Android Panic Prevention Wearable- To be determined- More details in Word documentation attached to project
