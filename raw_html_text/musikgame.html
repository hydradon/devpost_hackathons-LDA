                    This is a music guessing game. Using the Spotify API we ask you to log into your spotify account. Then we play songs based on your interest and you guess those songs for points. This was created at CU Boulder's Hack Day event Dec. 1st 2018

                    Then you will be asked for your user Id, this is the Spotify user identifier. Some peoples are a series of numbers, others are more similar to usernames. If your Spotify is connected with Facebook it is most likely that you have a series of numbers as your ID.

                <p>
                    Then you will be asked for a playlist name, enter whatever name you'd like.

                    Then the quiz starts.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group we all liked the Idea of working with the Spotify API. We started our brainstorm with a playlist maker but thought that was too general(and has already been done by Spotify). So after a brainstorm we decided that we wanted to build a game that was tailored towards that user.

                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First Level - The user is played 5 different songs from their recommended playlist. For each song the player is asked to guess the name of the song, with a max of 2 minutes to guess correctly. If the user is close enough to the name, then they will move to the next song. Every time the player incorrectly guesses, the score opportunity goes down 20 points (max of 5 guesses). If the user finishes the level with a good enough score, they will be able to move on the next level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second Level - This level works the same as the first level, but the player is instead asked to guess the name of the artists for the song being played.
