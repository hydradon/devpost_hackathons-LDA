                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Universities, among other public places, offer a range of accessibility services.  However, it can be difficult for those in need of these services to discover and utilize them.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Access Atlas consolidates campus wide accessibility services in one easy to use app.  Users can more easily find and engage with the services they need.  Our map shows the different locations of handicap parking spaces, entrances, and ramps.  Users can also be matched with services suited to them including accomodation letters and copies of class notes.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Google Maps API to layer a variety of accessibility services information, then put it into an easy to use app format with react-native.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>We had difficulty trying to simultaneously present a map overlay and the accessibility services map data.  Another hurdle was transferring our map to an app, since we had limited experience with app development.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>Access Atlas was my first foray into the world of APIs.  Having learned about the potential of APIs, I&rsquo;m excited to work with them again in future hacks.

                    What's next for Access Atlas
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to explore ways to collect and display information about accessibility services on other campuses and public settings.  Crowd-sourcing for this information seems like a promising solution that we would thrilled to work on.
