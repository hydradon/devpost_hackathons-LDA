                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Didn't know what to make for dinner one day, didn't have a lot of money to spend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users are able to post recipes and have it appear in a feed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application using Angular JS for the front end, and Java for the back end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking the back end to the front end was a huge problem that we ran into. Also inexperience in Angular.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating something that we believe has long term scalability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More Angular, Linking wegmans api, working in a team environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for brokemenu...v2!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully a lot more. We hope to integrate the Wegmans API fully in order to allow users to see if the groceries needed to create certain recipes are available at a Wegmans store near them, as well as integrating the price of the each ingredient and calculating it. We'd also like to improve the overall design of it.
