                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Help further Toronto's sustainability goals by accelerating the access of solar water heaters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Providing the the Toronto Atmospheric Fund a tool that facilitates their goal of providing solar water heaters to potential homeowners in the Toronto area.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Django web framework, accessing the Toronto Open Data API for solar water heater licensing information. Pull data from the JSON response and list it on a webpage. As of submission we are trying to feed this information into Google Maps API to create a mapped diagram of properties across the city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Toronto Open Data API was not well documented and required a lot of data massaging to utilize.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were finally able to isolate the data we needed and created a concatenated list that was rendered on HTML as well as prepared to pass into Google's API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Use of Open APIs in web frameworks and rendering of webpages through a MVC (model view controller) system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Solar Water Heater webpage
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were to take this further, we would like to finish the map integration. Furthermore, we would like to add the ability to filter by address, implement a login/logout system and incentive/sale system to integrate into the Toronto Atmospheric Fund site.
