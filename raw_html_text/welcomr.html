                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Welcomr provides a way for displaced LGBTQ peoples to connect with other LGBTQ members in their area of choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Twilio to host an SMS number and send SMS messages. We used the unofficial Grindr API to send and receive Grindr messages. Here is how it works. A refugee texts our Twilio number with a location, the location is converted to a geological location. We then used the unofficial Grindr API to find users in this geolocation that have a tag #Welcomr in their bio.
                    <br>
                    We now have a communication tunnel set up between the refugee and the Welcomr with our web server as a middleman. 
As a result, the refugee can easily communicate with someone in the LGBTQ community in their area of choice.
                    <br>
                    In addition, if the refugee and the Welcomr speak different languages, our application uses langdetect and goslate to translate the messages so they can easily communicate.
                </p>
