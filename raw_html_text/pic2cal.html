                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tired of spending so much time on our calendar apps making events.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pic2Cal transforms a picture of a poster you take with an event on it to an actual event on your phone's calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using a few Google APIs for each step of the process. They include Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Calendar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced many problems with the use of Google APIs because there were many unknown bugs with our computers. We also had to spend a lot of time authenticating the APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We loved learning about how different APIs work and how much work they can do. They can analyze and gather so much data from just a picture and some text!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pic2Cal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We look to improve its efficiency in collecting the right data.
