                    Traditionally, a patient has to go through the tedious process of contacting a doctor's secretary and booking an appointment which can very well be a few weeks later. Atleast, people from Germany would be aware of this problem of log waiting times to see a doctor. Inspired by Zeiss' pitch, we came to a conclusion that a lot of appointments made at the eye doctors are unnecesary and can be avoided using modern technology.

                    We have developed a seamless environment using AWS services especially Alexa, where the patient can take a picture of their eye and the image is processed in the cloud and then sent to the doctor. The doctor can conveniently access the images and their associated results from his/her Alexa device and provide feedback to the patients. In particular, we also focused also on the optimization of the work flow for the doctor. Our interface enables doctors to judge a large amount of eye pictures. Based on these results, the treatment for the entire population could be made faster and more accurate.
