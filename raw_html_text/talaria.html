                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of us saw a guy who made these but noticed he had enormous trouble making sharp turns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses the elastic energy of a spring to increase running efficiency, top speed, and stride. Enables sharp turns with an angled foot design and redirects some energy for upward force to make easier to turn.

                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    With a rough design in mind, we cut some wood, drilled some holes and screws, hammered some nails, and tied it with bungee cords.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each of our group members had prior commitments throughout the day so we weren't able to begin work on the project until 3pm. We solved this by working hard and having an idea of what we wanted to work on ahead of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We did not have bungee cords or a dowel so one of us had to MARTA to Home Depot to buy those things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We did not have a hammer so it was really difficult to nail things. We solved this by nailing a hole in one of our parts, then our other part, then just connecting them by putting the nail through the holes.
                </p>

                    We will make it out of metal and probably other better materials like plastic.
