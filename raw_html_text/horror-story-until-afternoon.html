                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided that some contestants in this hackathon could use a change of pace, so we decided on a horror game to help relieve stress.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will not only scare you, but make you question everything.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity and programmed/took javascript off online and tutorials.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not enough time, lots of bugs, had to start over at 3 in the morning because of a bug, first time using Unity.

                <p>
                    Proud that we actually came up with something that looks decent.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned more about coding and experienced the many frustrations of a programmer.
