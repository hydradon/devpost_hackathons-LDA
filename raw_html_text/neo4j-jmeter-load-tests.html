                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the past, when working on high volume imports in Neo4j, we had to create custom procedures and test their performance using CSV input data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We tried to achieve this using Gatling with the

                    , but for some reason, it was not playing well with CSV input files.

                    is also a very popular tool, we created our load tests with it and it worked very well. But these tests were a bit cumbersome to write because (unlike JDBC, JMS, ...),  there is no native bolt protocol support in Jmeter. We had to do a lot of manual scripting.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We forked JMeter on GitHub and created the components for bolt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built example load tests scripts to validate it was working fine.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    The JMeter codebase is a pure java GUI, quite different from the usual projects we work on. We were not sure where to start.
Hopefully, the JMeter team gave us some guidance, many thanks to them!

                <p>
                    When writing some load testing components, you have to be very careful on how to handle data, or everything will crash very quickly!
