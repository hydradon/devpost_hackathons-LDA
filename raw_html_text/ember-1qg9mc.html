                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voter fraud in New York called for people to search for a medium where they could be taken seriously, make actual change, and create a movement.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the "upvote" system to organize and distribute problems affecting both your community and the outside world.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While incomplete, the app will be built on Swift and use the Parse API... While very similar to the app Yik Yak, the audience is much different, and the exposure will be much higher.

                    Challenges I ran into

                <p>
                    My main technical leads had family issues and illness, and thus were not able to complete the project...

                <p>
                    I feel that we dealt with the issue as well as we could, and tried to deliver the product in a visual sense.

                    What I learned

                    I learned a lot about project management, as well as how to handle major obstacles.
