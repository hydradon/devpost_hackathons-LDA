                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever commuted past a disused space that you know could be put to better use?
Have you ever had a great idea for your street or your local area? Maybe you shared it
with your friends or your family but that&rsquo;s it?
What if you could connect with other people that support your idea, help you refine it,
or even donate their time or money to help you achieve it?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we heard
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are other sites that list community ideas and suggestions. There are other sites for fundraising. They have no way for ideas to get traction, find collaborators, and build a community.

                    Let&rsquo;s just say you are walking down Elizabeth Street, it&rsquo;s dull, it&rsquo;s gray, smeared with ugly graffiti:  it&rsquo;s just plain boring. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if there was a colourful mural in this spot? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if you could not only envision this, but communicate it to others: Jump to pretty city.  Post your idea, share it on facebook, build a following, find collaborators, acquire donations.
Pretty City is a hub which allows you to upload ideas about improving your urban environment, sharing it with others, and making it happen.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it as a responsive web app and mobile app that uses google maps, facebook, android nearby, and braintree APIs to deliver a rich and integrated user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ve identified a weakness as not getting enough momentum to get critical mass of users.
Our strategy to gain momentum would be to source projects / ideas from Council and Tourism NSW etc. before launching the site. This would allow a larger &ldquo;launch&rdquo; and garner media attention etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We overcame this by providing a framework for the ideas using geo-location, tags and textual descriptions, photos and mock up capabilities. The app then allows you to broadcast the idea, to validate the idea with likes and followers, but MORE importantly finding other collaborators and funders that can help you on your journey to prettify the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pretty City is about creating a flow between idea inception, community and implementation.
