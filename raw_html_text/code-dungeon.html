                <p>
                    For real, Code Dungeon is a programming adventure game which encourages beginners to learn and improve their knowledge of basic programming concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By engaging the user with an interesting and story-driven experience we hope to pique the interest of novices and enable them to learn in a fun and rewarding way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Code Dungeon entirely in JavaScript so that it could be enjoyed via the browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that there were many features we had initially planned to add that ended up being scrapped due to time constraints. However, we did implement the core functionality we had originally aimed for and hope to build upon the project in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we managed to build a fully working game from start to finish in the time limit, and very happy with how it turned out in regards to the user experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improved/Reinforced JavaScript development skills, learned to prioritise core functionality over smaller features (even if they would be much more enjoyable to implement :( )
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Code Dungeon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to completely finish and polish our prototype and continue building levels to teach more of the basic principles of programming.
