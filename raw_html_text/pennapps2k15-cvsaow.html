                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shop-buddy focuses on learning consumer shopping habits and providing future real time notifications and suggestions as to what the user should buy. Along with providing alerts in regards to any previous products the user has bought, we also suggest other related products consumers may be interested in.
                    <br>
                    All you have to to do is scan your desired product (either in a web browser or on your mobile phone) and a click later, you are purchasing your deodorant or paper towel! Keep in mind that the more you buy from our interface, the more the system will learn about your habits and provide text alerts and notifications in the future. We have an easy visual represntation system that allows users to view a calendar of previous scanned items as well as when you should be purchasing new items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We feel that this system can revolutionize how people shop. Instead of traveling to a grocery store every sunday night with a list of what you
                    <i>
                        think
                    </i>
                    you need, just use Shop-buddy! It will remind you to buy your low-stock items in your house
                    <i>
                        only
                    </i>
                    when you need them, and its a simple scan-and-click away from having that 2 day Amazon Prime shipping. It is quick, easy to use and has a clean interface for any demographic of customers!

                    : We believe our system can truly change the way people shop and purchase goods. Why go out to the store every Sunday evening or have to worry about creating a grocery list? Our system is able to identify, based on user habits, what users need and when they need it before they even know it!

                    The list of included features is only a small portion of what we originally imagined. With further development we can easily add:

                <p>
                    In addition, we would love to build up and include better machine learning algorithms to truly understand and learn what to display to our users.
