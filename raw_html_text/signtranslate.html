                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There's yet to be Sign Language translation built-ins for Google Translate or any social media platforms such as Snap or Facebook.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SignTranslate is an Android camera app that enable real-time communications for English speaker and Sign Language speaker. It translates one Sign Language character at a time and compose a word, or a phrase. We plan to integrate the tool with user's daily routines, as well as social media platforms such as Snapchat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio for the picture/video recording and aim to use Google Cloud TPU for machine learning model. We used Google Cloud Storage Bucket to store training data and models.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's really hard to properly configure the dependencies on GCP TPU as there is little existing/preconfigured image that we can use. We also had issues with changes made to the tensorflow structure that affected the tf and keras dependencies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the camera and cloud storage working, and we are more familiar with Docker and setting up Cloud TPU now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SignTranslate
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want continuous classification and translation for gestures, but of course we need to first get the character-by-character version working. We'll play with different machine learning models once we have the TPU setup (also we need to factor in how much budget we need to get to a reasonable error rate for daily communications)
