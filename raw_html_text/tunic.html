                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've done research involving DNA, RNA, and proteins for the past two years. Reflecting on my projects, I realized that I had a lot of overlap between the two projects: many of the functions were similar. I wondered if I could create a Python library to simplify dealing with DNA and RNA and teach kids at the same time. Hence, EduBio and nucleopy were born.

                    <code>
                        nucleopy
                    </code>
                    is a Python library which allows users to create DNA and RNA objects. Methods for such objects include
                    <code>
                        toDNA
                    </code>
                    as well as RNA folding.
                    <code>
                        nucleopy
                    </code>
                    has a wrapper for easy creation of tensorflow models as well. This was the aspect of the project targeted to academics and bioinformaticians. EduBio is a pygame framework built on top of
                    <code>
                        nucleopy
                    </code>
                    which contains animations and a short game on teaching how DNA codes for proteins.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used pygame for implemeting the animations and game.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    I had to learn pygame, a library which I had never used before.

                <p>
                    Somehow getting around the circular imports and fine-tuning the pygame animations.

                    How to use pygame and improved my OOP skills.

                <p>
                    Add more mini-games and add more functions to the
                    <code>
