                <p>
                    Imagine walking into a booth and entering a keyword of a topic on a computer screen. Suddenly, all the LEDs around you light up with different colors and intensities. Isn't it beautiful to be able to
                    <strong>
                        feel
                    </strong>
                    the sentiments of the world on a particular topic? Our project aims to create an environment where users can
                    <strong>
                        feel
                    </strong>
                    real-time social media sentiments by immersing themselves in a physical setting with LED lights. We want to increase people&rsquo;s awareness of social issues and give people a sense of social responsibility when it comes to social media interactions.

                    <li>
                        The Raspberry Pi is used as a
                        <strong>
                            controller
                        </strong>
                        for an LED strip where each LED light is individually controlled. The user enters space-delimited keyword(s) in the text box of a pop-up
                        <strong>
                            UI
                        </strong>
                        . After clicking the button, the
                        <strong>
                            LED strip
                        </strong>
                        will show different colors with different intensities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each LED light represents an aggregation of a certain number of tweets: the color of the LED represents an
                        <strong>
                            emotional category
                        </strong>
                        (sadness as blue, joy as yellow, fear as white, anger as red), and the intensity of the color represents the
                        <strong>
                            intensity of the emotion
                        </strong>
                        . The darker the color, the more intense the emotion is. Colors are sorted in a way that similar colors appear next to each other. By observing the number of LED lights and their corresponding colors, users will have an intuitive idea of
                        <strong>
                            social sentiments of real-time tweets on that particular topic

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the
                    <strong>
                        GPIO
                    </strong>
                    library to interface the

                        Raspberry Pi
                    </strong>
                    with the
                    <strong>
                        LED strip
                    </strong>
                    . We used the
                    <strong>
                        neopixel
                    </strong>
                    library to enable individual control of the LED lights on the LED strip. We built the simple yet easy-to-use U* with Python&rsquo;s
                    <strong>
                        tkinter
                    </strong>
                    module. We fetched real-time tweets by using the
                    <strong>
                        tweepy
                    </strong>
                    API. We analyzed the emotional categories as well as the emotional intensities of tweets by using the
                    <strong>
                        IBM Watson

                        We spent quite some time installing all necessary Python

                            dependencies
                        </strong>
                        on the Raspberry Pi due to environment configuration issues since we first wrote our code on our laptops. It was challenging and tiresome to figure out different installation paths and how that affects our code.

                    <li>
                        It was hard to integrate

                        into our code since IBM&rsquo;s API does not have the best documentation. It was a lot of pain reading through the source code of the API and trying to understand the internal behaviors of the API.

                    <li>
