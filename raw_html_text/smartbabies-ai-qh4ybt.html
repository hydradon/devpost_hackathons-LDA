                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My cofounder Dmytro Lisenbart, a very experienced animations director created a cartoon for his daughter where a robot tutor Dori educates children. This idea grew into an animation series of 52 episodes which already raised $2M for making pilot. And having Dori in this world, we imagined that we can bring her to our days through edutainment mobile application that works as Personal Assistant and Teacher for kids.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We already built a voice-controlled media player and 3 games using a mash-up of speech services to transform speech to commands inside the app. Children can ask Dori to play them cartoons on Google Chromecast, Apple TV and Amazon Fire Stick, and it uses Google Home and Amazon Alexa devices as background sound in it's games.
