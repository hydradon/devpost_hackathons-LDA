                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People can easily find recipes based on the food that they currently have.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app allows you to take a picture of any food, such as an apple, and numerous recipes that use an apple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this mainly using React-native on the front since it is a mobile app and we used mongo db and express on the server side.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using React Native so we had to spend a lot of time debugging errors in our code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app can connect to the Watson API and retrieve the response object for an image successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use React Native and how to use the IBM Watson API.
                </p>

                    What's next for Cook My Fridge
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to use machine learning to have more relevant recipes show up first.
