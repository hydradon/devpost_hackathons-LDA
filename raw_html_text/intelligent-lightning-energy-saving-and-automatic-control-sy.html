                    We are facing a real problem of shortage of electricity in our country especially for non-development. Although we have enough electricity in our country but most of the electricity is wasting. Intelligent lightning system is one of the new technology with low price that can address those mention problems We are facing a real problem of shortage of electricity in our country especially for non-development.

                <p>
                    The working of &ldquo;Intelligent lightning system&rdquo; is based on the luminous energy in the environment at that moment. The System is based on the light intensity in the environment and adjusts itself with the natural light for giving you a perfect luminous energy of all rooms. The LDR get the current luminous energy of current environment. The application is not only for smart building it can be used in work stations, park lights and street lights.
