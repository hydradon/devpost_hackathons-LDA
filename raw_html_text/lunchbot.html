                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At work, we love when our coworkers bring us lunch. Yay! But when we get lunch for them, do we get the appreciation we deserve? It's a big pain in the butt to ask a bunch of people what they want, listen to them debate, and then parse their answers into a simple order list. And whose turn is it to get coffee anyway?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    LunchBot solves these pains by handling order requests in natural language conversation right in the team conversation on Glip. LunchBot announces that a trip is being made, takes a limited number of orders, and then sends a single text message to the driver who's already on his way to In-N-Out (or wherever!). When the driver gets to the counter to order, everything is in one simple list. Wow, that's great!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We set up a Node server that hosts the chatbot logic built with the Botkit framework. LunchBot listens to the Glip channel and responds accordingly. We used a variety of tools such as postman, requestb.in, ngrok, and others to develop.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML5 media capture capabilities proved to be a challenge when integrating directly with Voicebase. We found a solution to go to an intermediary server before hitting the API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In this hackathon, Ray learned a lot about working with APIs, having primarily a UX and UI background. Sasi learned about Nodejs and now we have a lot more confidence with full stack prototyping.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LunchBot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine you'd like to interview for a promotion at work. The hiring manager doesn't know you super well, but she can see that you get your co-workers lunch more than anyone else in the company -- she even remembers that you brought her lunch just last week. Wow!
