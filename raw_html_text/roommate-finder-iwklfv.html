                    Jason, a second year grad student just concluded his lease for his current housing.

                    A better recommendor system (e.g. amazon's item to item collaborative filtering) will replace the current scoring algorithm. This will open up the gateway to real-time recommendation evaluation. Additionally, our psychologist has promised to add many more fun questions to make the review form even more fun.
