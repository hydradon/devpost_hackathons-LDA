                    is a temperature sensor that receives a signal from the user and responds to it in changing the temperature of the room.

                    can transform a user's room into a productive study space. Having low productivity is not something uncommon, and there are lot ways to Improve productivity, but these ways often require us to contribute something, such as: stay away from our smart phone.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent quite a bit of time in researching the impact of temperature on productivity and the recommended room temperature for different tasks. Then, we used python as our main programming language for the sensor code.

                    First time Hacking, zero experience. We had more technical difficulties than we expected.

                <p>
                    We are proud of ourselves that we have taken the first step into programming and was able to start a project from scratch with no experience.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had learned a lot of handy technical skills during this Hackathon, from all workshops that we had attended, as well as all the online resources that are out there. But mostly importantly, it gave us a better understanding of how to apply coding into solving a real life problem.
