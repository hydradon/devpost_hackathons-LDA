                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wanted a bigger screen to watch with friends
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now it duplicates video streams across devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iOS development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is supposed to eventually be developed into cropped portions of videos to make one large screen. Local unreliable internet with firewall, native iOS video player is terrible
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    Worked hard on the project even though it didn't turn out as well as we expected
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned some new iOS techniques in video processing and multipeer communication between devices
