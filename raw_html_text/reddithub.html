                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After looking at reddit's nearly 5 year old design, which for reason of good tradition, has not been redesigned. There is a desperate need in this modern age to provide a UI/UX with better accessability, manageability, and cognitive ease.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    This application reroutes essential components of reddit's website. It provides a way to view multiple subreddits concurrently without overloading the user as well as saving all settings real-time in the browser's localStorage

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When needing real-time needs, we found a real-time library such as meteor best suited for our needs. We used technologies such as meteor and javascript to create the design.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Navigating the reddit api and combining the necessary endpoints to do so provided some hurdles to it's creation
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    Creating an application in a foreign framework is a lot harder than it looks!
