                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I know FaceID can detect whether you are looking at the phone and was wondering how accurate this could be; and if it is accurate enough, can I paint with my eyes?

                    This app allows you to draw with your eyes!

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm relatively new to iOS programming. I just tweaked someone else's code on Github and added in features I wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm not familiar with the Swift syntax and iOS programming in general. It was difficult to do anything, even if simple ones, since I quickly go into unfamiliar realms by taking a step in any direction. Even getting a few buttons to work took quite some time since using Auto Layout was painful...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am now more familiar with iOS programming. I've done a very tiny bit of iOS many years ago and think I improved quite a lot over night.
