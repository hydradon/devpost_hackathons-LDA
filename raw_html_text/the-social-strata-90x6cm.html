                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    These are bleeding edge technologies that I wanted to put together for a project, the hackathon challenge was a good opportunity.
As I had a lot of time constraints during the weekend and couldn't commit to a team, I decided to take the challenge alone and opted for MaterializeCSS for the front-end mobile look'n'fell. It was my first time working with it and it has a lot of limitations.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working on a project using ReactJS and MeteorJS is the thing I'm most proud about. It's very easy now to polish the design of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned lots of things, mainly about how Meteor works with ReactJS and ReactRouter. Also, I had not used ES6 besides a couple tutorials and it was really nice to learn it for good.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a couple of unmarked checkboxes in the readme.md file that lists a lot of next steps. Design polishing, push notifications and picture uploads are a few to mention.
