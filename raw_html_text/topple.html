                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the Unity tutorials involves making a ball move and gather coins. I placed a cube to see if I can push it off the edge of the plane, and got the idea to stack the cubes together to topple them over.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You move a ball and ram it to the stacked blocks to topple as many of them as you can.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I made the ball move with player input and added rigidbody physics to it and every block in the game. I stacked the blocks together to form letters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I initially planned to code a life planner mobile app with Android Studio. That's when I learned that the computer I brought can't run the emulator. So, I attempted the same project, but on a website. I had trouble connecting Google App Engine with the free domain and it was taking too long. So, I decided to do something new this time and delve into Unity.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of

                <p>
                    I'm glad I was able to make something this weekend. It may not be what I initially planned to make, but it's something. I'm also helping a group make a game using Unity, so it's nice to learn the basics of it. I also made the blocks spell MLH.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity basics like making a plane, placing assets, coloring them, adding code to the assets.

                <p>
                    Stack a bunch of digital cups together and ram it with a ball.
