                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Today, everyone lives a fast-paced life. It's becoming increasingly difficult to follow the news. On top of that, traditional media publishers tend to be biased in reporting current events. With the rise of byte sized media, people prefer to consume their information in the most efficient way. We've created Peek in response to these trends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Peek curates the top user-generated videos on current events and provides them to the public in a streamlined way. Now, it's easy to be informed and most importantly, be informed from the first-person perspective. YOU have the power to peek into the lens of someone experiencing a "current" event in real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peek raises awareness and increases empathy among its users. When people see an event happening from the first-person perspective of a civilian, it makes the event seem more real, and incites a feeling of urgency and action.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the YouTubeAPI to query our results and some JavaScript to parse and filter the results. HTML/CSS were used to develop the web app itself.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Peek takes power from the hands of large media publishers and gives it to the people.
Peek has an intuitive video scroll layout which trumps traditional text heavy, clickbait-y media sources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can make a difference; sometimes it's just changing the perspective. With all of the awful things going on in the world, we each need to do our part. Everyone has it in them, it's just a matter of giving them the right lens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Peek
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many potential features for Peek!
