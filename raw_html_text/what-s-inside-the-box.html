                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat and we wanted to make use of the mystery of what's in the box to make it a puzzle game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You have 2 minutes to guess what animal is inside the box that is underneath you. There will be circular spots that open periodically that you can peek into and then verbally guess what the animal is. If you are correct, you score a point and another animal will appear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity and Hololens. We made use of the verbal commands for guessing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the hololens configuration to work with Unity and to actually publish the game to the hololens. Needed to also update the software required and it was not easy with a wonky wifi connection
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We manage to get something that is fun and entertaining within a very very short amount of time. We had a lot of fun making it as well and learnt a lot about unity and hololens technologies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A very good wifi is VERY VERY important to development work. Also Hololens technologies is pretty straight forward to implement and not as scary as we first thought.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for What's inside the box?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was definitely a very interesting experience and if it becomes affordable, we would love to continue developing a variety of different games for it.
