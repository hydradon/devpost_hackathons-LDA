                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The time i went to my grandparents around 100km from Addis Ababa, it was clear that the place is near to Addis, with every infrastructure needed available, the framers were not engaged in vegetable framing, they only focused on cereal farming. I started thinking why because, it is clear that there is high demand in vegetables through the year in the capital city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system will receive realtime data from sensors deployed to the central server, which in turn sends the data to installed mobile applications. It will also send notification alert messages to the mobiles and SMS.
The collected data will be organized and interpreted to give meaningful information to the user. I will facilitate fast decision making and enable the farmers(users), to learn through the data to create a suitable condition that can create improved productivity.
