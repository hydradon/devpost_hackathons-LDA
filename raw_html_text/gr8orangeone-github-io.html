                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am the graphic designer for the club and I wanted to redesign our aestetic and try to make the design more modern and interesting
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    this site integrates our events and contact and currently has place holder media as I do not have any but hope to get some and not give up any of the videos. There is also a dedicated mobile design along with the desktop one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I mostly used Adobe Muse to create the site however I am using git hub to host the site for now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had not used muse very much before this event but now would consider myself proficent. I also encountered a number of issues along the way trying to get a sticky header, and keeping the website acessible on a number of different resolutions and devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I feel that having really learned muse I can continue to create some great sites. I am proud that I was able to create such a nice site in such a short amount of time and I feel with more time it will only get better
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use get hub a bit better and I also learned muse as well how to make a visualy apealing site for a number of platforms
                </p>
