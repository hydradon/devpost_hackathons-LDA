                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is to empower girls and boys through sponsorship. We achieve this by incentivizing sponsors and allowing them to receive instant gratification and feedback from the child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sponsoring a child allows for a variety of methods of empowerment, from allowing to not have to fetch water everyday and allow them to go to school, to buying simple school supplies to accelerate their education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A recent study from the University of Chicago shows that sponsorship leads to a higher percentage of school completion and that it only reaches a fraction of the percentage of children that have difficulties accessing education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to bring current technologies into this dated program to drive more sponsors, affecting one child at a time. We leverage Facebook tools to provide an instant connection and real time feedback between sponsor and child.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It provides a platform to connect sponsors to children and allows for instant feedback and connection through Facebook tools such as Messenger, Safety Check, and Video Calling
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python's Flask framework to bring up a service which was templated by Jinja2, HTML, and SCSS from scratch
                </p>
