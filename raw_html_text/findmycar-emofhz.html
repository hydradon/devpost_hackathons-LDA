                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just admit it, we all have times that we forgot where we park our car and spending 30 mins running up and down in the parking structure to find it. At lease, me, myself have experienced this. So, I think it will be convenient to develop a software to help people find where they parking their cars.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our android app, Find My Car can help people find where they park their cars, no matter it is an outdoor parking lot or huge parking structure. Find My Car applies to car with bluetooth connection. User needs to turn on the bluetooth on his cell phone. When the bluetooth connects to the car device, our app will recognize the connection. When user stop the car engine, the disconnection of the bluetooth and cell phone will trigger our app to mark the altitude, latitude, longitude of that location, which is where the car parks. And when the user needs to find his car, he will turn on Find My Car. There are two selections he can choose. If he is unaware of where the parking structure is, he can select Direction, which uses google map to direct use to the parking structure/parking lot. And inside the parking space, he can switch the mode to walking route, then there will be an compass tells user which direction his car is at now using a compass. There also will be an instruction telling the user should go up or go down to reach the floor he parked.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1.We use android studio to develop the application. 
2.We use the disconnect of the bluetooth  and the car to active our program.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We have different options to get the parking location of the car: the top selection is GPS, if GPS is not available, we use the nearby network's physical address to determine the user.
4.We use google map to direct the user from where he is to the parking structure/parking lot.
5.Whe the user enters the parking structure/parking lot, we will instruct the user go up or down to reach the car's parking level.
6.When the user is in the parking structure/parking lot, we use the current location of the phone, and the car's location to determine which direction the user walk would approach the car. We calculate the angular displacement analyzing the azimuth.

                </ol>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We had trouble in developing the map function using the Google Maps API, so we ended up using the Google Maps.
2  We took some time to figure out how to determine the rotation angle for our compass according to the current location and the car location.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>

                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The car only takes less than 1 percent of the CPU usage, so it saves battery for the phone.
2.We calculate the angular displacement by analyzing the azimuth.

                    <li>
                        We learnt how to monitor bluetooth connection status in the background.

                    <li>
                        We are more familiar with the Google Map API.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We learnt to implement android sensor magnet function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We came up with an algorithm for finding the angular displacement of the car and current location on the compass. We calculate the angular displacement by analyzing the azimuth.
