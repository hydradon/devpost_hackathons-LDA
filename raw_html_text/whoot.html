                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an anonymous chat room, but to make it more fun. Thus,
                    <strong>
                        who
                    </strong>
                    ot was born.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After opening a chatroom, a user is given a random name. Sharing the link to the room allows you to invite your friends to chat. There is a built-in drawing game. (details)

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we were going to use Google Polymer for our front-end, but in the middle of the hackathon we decided to go with Angular.js since we were facing too many difficulties with the framework. The backend uses Express.js and Socket.io to handle chat and gaming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to try Google Polymer, but we found it difficult to use because none of us were familiar with its paradigms. After moving to Angular, we found programming the game to be annoying difficult. Not mention the difficulty of using sockets to transmit data
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By 8AM we seemed to have something that worked, which in the end, is all that matters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's important to choose your frameworks wisely. What we made in polymer in 12 hours was redone in angular.js in only 1.
