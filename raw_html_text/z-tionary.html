                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we feel disconnected with our grandparents/parents when they don't understand the slang we use!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes in text input (i.e. a phrase or sentence) and outputs a "translation" with all the identified Generation Z slang replaced with more easily understandable synonyms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this as a webpage that takes user text input, with Firebase as the database that holds all of the slang and their synonyms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of issues with choosing a feasible project. Initially we also wanted to make an iOS app but had no experience with Swift, so we switched to web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a working webpage that does translate Gen-Z slang with reasonable output.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Firebase, how to narrow our solution down to a minimum viable solution, how to work together!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Z-Tionary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Adding a dynamic aspect to the database so it updates automatically, maybe scraping data from a website like Urban Dictionary
-Adding Natural Language Processing to check for grammatically correct sentences, since some of the outputs don't necessarily make sense in English
-Maybe connecting it to Twitter or a messaging app so there's a more concrete and accessible application of the program
