                    Inspiration Saida a Bee farmer in Jasekan, has a bee farm with 20 beehives.  Each hive contains 15 comb frames. To check the readiness and quantity of the Combs for honey harvesting, she has to manually lift each wooden bar frame which sometimes yields no results because the honey isn't ready enough for harvesting.This daily routine for Saida is a slow and arduous task.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In comes Smart Bee. We provide sensors that are attached to the beehives which alerts the farmer to know the readiness of the comb for harvesting. Thus, she does less to make more. Consequently is able to increase profitability and expand. The sensor will also make sure her conditions in the hives are condusive for honey production. Smart Bee's Sensor when upgraded will help check the quality of the honey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Honey Sensor was built by consulting a hardware developer who designed the sensor to check defined parameters. A software developer was also brought on board to develop an on-site application for the monitoring device to interpret the measurements taken for the bee keeper. When Saida uses our honey sensor, she only needs to open the hive because she is sure the honey is ready for harvest just by seeing the green light which signifies readiness for harvest. Red light of the sensor means it's not ready at all while Yellow signifies the presence of little honey in the comb. With the Sensor, she can also know the temperature and humidity levels of each hive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges we run into was; the problem of constant internet and mobile network coverage , financing the project, ensuring our applications were user friendly  across all demographics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smart Bee seems to be  the first company ever to develop a device that helps Bee keepers monitor the state of readiness and quality of their honey.
Smart Bee is also proud of creating a 100% internet free device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the process of bringing our sensor into existence, as a team we learnt how to cooperate among ourselves.
Also, we have learnt and researched on bee farming. 
Finally, one key thing we have all learnt is to realise how powerful our creative capabilities are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Vision for Smart Bee is to further design our Honey Sensor into a mobile device that can be bought by individuals who wants to check the quality of honey they buy. 
Also, Smart Bee envisions her company to becoming the authority in the optimization of honey production. Thank you.
