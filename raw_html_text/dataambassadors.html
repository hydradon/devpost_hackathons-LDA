                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want everyone who visits the Interactive Timeline of Diplomacy exhibit 
at the Diplomacy Center to learn how the US had very few missions around the world when it was born and outposts grew so that now we have men and women of the State Department in nearly every country.

                <p>
                    An interactive timeline of diplomacy data visualization app that helps visitors to understand American diplomacy and history events through time. The project is written in vanilla javascript with plotly.js. User may scroll the interactive glob around, zoom in and out of the map, and click the embassy to view the info label. User may also press a play button to animate the embassy establishment and closure chronologically. The app also highlights major history events in the animation. We also used Amazon Polly to create audio for the animation narratives.
