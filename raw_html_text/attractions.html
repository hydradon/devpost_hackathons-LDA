                    Webapp built with the Google Maps API. The idea was to display a map with markers to the current user, helping them to find attractions/restaurants/things to do in their area. The markers would display a description/info on the activity, as well as the amount of hearts it has (to show if others recommend it). Users would use the planner to pick activities, and after doing one, they could contribute and add their own input.

                    We were able to implement some parts of our idea, but we also ran into quite a few challenges. However, we learned a lot in doing this project, and hope to continue working on it in the future!
