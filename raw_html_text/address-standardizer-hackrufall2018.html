                    Optum had an interesting challenge that we thought we would be able to have fun thinking up a solution for.

                    Keeping the whole thing internal. The hardest part about the project was finding a reliable database(s) or US mailing addresses that did not require any external API calls to access. Our first reaction was to check out OpenStreetMap and download their database for use with our program, however
                    <a href="https://planet.openstreetmap.org/" rel="nofollow">
                        the size of the raw map files scared us off

                    and got something we could start working with, but the data we were able to glean from this database was incomplete.
                </p>

                    Finally, we went back to the USPS website and found their
