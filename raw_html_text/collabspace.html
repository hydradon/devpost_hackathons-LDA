                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired because we thought that it would be an easy way to standardize the way people collaborate, since often the meaning of collaboration can be unclear with ambiguous academic integrity policies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It matches you with tutors if you need one, allows you to set up collaboration sessions with your friends, allows you to use whiteboard sessions online to keep track of your collaboration with your classmates and allows you to see who's in your classes and arrange to meet.
