                <p>
                    It is very convenient for a patient to search the information of a certain brand of drug about its drug-interactions. Once you input the brand name of a drug you want to search for, you will get all similar products with the same active ingredient. If you press the 'Interaction' button, you will get all the information about the interactions of the drug in a bubble-chart. If you click one of the bubbles shown below, you will get all of the brand names of the drug that interacts with the drug you want to search.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The greatest challenge for us was to learn the grammar of javascript libraries in a short period, and we were also struggling with data importing.

                    We learned how to survive under pressure, and tried our very best to meet all our expectations. And of course, it's hard to make perfect hacking in only 24 hours.
