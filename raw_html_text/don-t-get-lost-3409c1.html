                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to help people with Alzheimer to remember who they are, their families and details about their daily lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an app that allows people to enter information about their lives, families, and others, in order to remember all of those details that seem to be gone sometimes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Flutter to build this app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced problems like the design of the app itself, slow internet connection, the user interphase, and others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're specially proud of using a tool that we've never used before!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to build apps with Flutter, to solve some problems, to do proper research about what we want to achieve, and to get organized so every team member can develop in a determined task.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Don't Get Lost
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd love to improve it, to add some other widgets like buttons and images, and to someday help Alzheimer people.
