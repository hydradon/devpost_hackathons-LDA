                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dream Team 2016 was inspired by applying design space exploration for the true hobbyist RC aircraft enthusiasts who would like to build their own aircraft without going into the nitty gritty of physics and mathematics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tool provides an intuitive, interactive medium to open the design space beyond the commercial model aircraft industry. The Snobby Hobbyist GUI allows the user to select the sizing parameters and airfoil of their flying wing planform. From there, they will receive an excel file which has been pre-formatted for the Catia modeling tool, creating the general shape of their desired wing for manufacturing purposes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a GUI and functional script in parallel to create the parametric equations relating user inputs to physical and aerodynamic characteristics. The goal of connecting Catia was kept in mind when creating output files for the planform shape to ensure user specifications will be carried through each step. We desired to have a proof of concept and worked with the intension of having a 3D printed model and working power system which were created with the easy to use mCookie Microduino systems.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The major hurdles were with software licensing and connecting to a web interface rather than a desktop application. We worked around this by providing both a file intended for Catia desktop and the proof of concept in SolidWorks.

                <p>
                    We learned how to link many different platforms to create one robust system.
