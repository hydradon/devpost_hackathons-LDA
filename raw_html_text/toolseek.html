                    I built an arcade machine over the summer and had to spend a lot of needless money purchasing tools for woodworking.

                <p>
                    Separated modules for backend and frontend. Used vue.js and es6 modules and components to keep with current conventions. Node.js, express, and vue.js

                    We tried using loopback but we gave up after a long time. we switched to just express
