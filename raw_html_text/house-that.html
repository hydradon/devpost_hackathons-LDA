                    Inspiration Not many users are aware of the risks associated with buying a house in a particular area. "House that" helps a user who is trying to purchase a house by displaying the various risks that are bound to the home purchase.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does "House that" displays the various risks related to a home purchase without the user having to explicitly look for it. Since, most of them are not informed about the possible threats, It also advises the user to purchase a home insurance to cover these threats based on his interest.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How I built it We leveraged IBM Bluemix Watson cognitive services to perform intelligent risk analysis and display it to the user. We used AlchemyAPI and twitter insights to suggest all possible risks and tradeoff analytics to help the user decide on purchasing the most suitable insurance policy.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into The internet connectivity was terrible. Bluemix deployment was very slow at times. We also had some ups and downs while building the backend.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of : Finally, we were able to build a working chrome extension and a website to supplement it.
