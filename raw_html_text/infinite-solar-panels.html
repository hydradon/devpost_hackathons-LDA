                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Elon Musk has made shingle solar panels. The small and compact design inspired us to see what other uses these solar panels could be used to benefit society  by substituting the unhealthy alternatives with infinite solar panels
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solar panels are able to be used for different things such as used on a house, car and other electric-based products it is also able to be connected to other models from the actual main box or motherboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had created our model using materials which model the actual real-life materials since most of the materials we require were not in the kits, Most likely next time we would bring some of our own materials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having time to create our 3d printed materials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the slides in time as well as creating a working product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about coding and 3D printing. We also learned about many of Canadas issues and thought of many ideas.
We need to spend more time on actually creating our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Infinite Solar Panels
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prototype of our product using the required materials to be used in the real world.
