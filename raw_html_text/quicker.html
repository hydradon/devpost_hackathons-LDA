                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While searching for Health Care issues we stumbled across patient wait time. It is reported that average emergency department wait times (about 30 minutes) and treatment times (about 90 minutes), which add up to roughly two hours in the ER. After reading that statistic, we brainstormed solutions to help minimize that wait time and maximize their healthcare visit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    QuickER allows for patients to queue themselves into the ER along with relevant information about their circumstances.

                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Angular-CLI to scaffold out the project and create the components we outlined on the white board.  Next, we followed the BootStrap documentation and featured examples to build up our components.  Then we connected the Google FireStore and switched the components over to pull data from the database rather than static test data.  Finally we used the Angular CLI to build the finished website and deployed to a Google Cloud Bucket.

                <h2>
                    Challenges We ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was hardware issues when installing our web frameworks. These were overcome by deleting copious amounts of files from our computers. We were new to Angular and had to learn as we went.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that We're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Angular was tough but really gratifying. We worked hard to make the website responsive and give a great UX.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned much about time management and teamwork in a time sensitive situation. If we had not properly divided the work, it&rsquo;s hard to say if our hack would be what it is now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for QuickER
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;d love to add multi-language support using google-translate as well as speech to text. We also would love to implement a &ldquo;time-added&rdquo; field to the patient cards.
