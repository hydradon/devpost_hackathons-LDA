                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always enjoyed retro games.  Starfox is a simple space-flight game that I believed would be fun and challenging to implement with the P5.js library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Starfox spaceship flies through space and shoot lasers at asteroids, although there is no explosion event yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    P5.js allows for a developer to create basic shape and manipulate them with basic data structures and math.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The math that is involved with using a simple javascript UI library is difficult and time consuming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although I wish I was able to stay for the full extent of the event, I enjoyed the atmosphere of the Hackathon.  Starting with nothing and a few hours later being able to see the results was very satisfying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is very difficult to properly implement basic shapes with simple data structures in a short amount of time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bug Fixes, High Scores, Asteroid collision events.
