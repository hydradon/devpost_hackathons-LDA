                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to know how many times people visited stack overflow at a hackathon. Therefore we wanted to capture packets and track what was going on around us. Soon it changed from just tracking stackoverflow visits to tracking all http packets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app tracks http request that are being thrown in the current network and visualizes how many visits different websites have. Along with that we can also track the history of a specific mac address that we have detected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used GO to develop the backend for sniffing packets and then passed the data to our html pages which displayed the data. The data was visualized using the d3 js library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging to get the right set up and environment working. Especially trying to get promiscuous and monitor mode working to allow us to grab packets.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Got promiscuous mode to work.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Never deal with wireless packets and your wifi card when you have an operating system to do it for you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It will live in a corner of Github for all eternity.
