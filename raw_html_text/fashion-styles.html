                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project came from buzz-feed and a mentor from Jam hacks. We noticed that we enjoyed fashion and we were pretty experienced and many people struggled to find their style and find something they can find comfort within. We thought this was a very smart idea as it added our own personal talent as well as helped others.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website is built so that the user does a quiz and types of styles are shown to them, where they can think of what they want and plan their ideas through this website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML CSS and this was our first time coding and we used the first website we thought would help us to understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges such as trying to understand the program, trying to format it in the way we wanted as well as creating the styles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we did anything and we were able to do as much code as we did and were able to gain something from their program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I gained insight into coding and the different languages and the different ways to code. I found so many ways to solve my problems without needing help and just coming up with a plan and seeing it almost come into action.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fashion Styles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would definitely want to add all the functions and learn sophisticated ways to make the website in order to make this website much better.
