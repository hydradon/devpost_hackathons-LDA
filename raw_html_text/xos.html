                    Inspiration:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    It arises from the lack of time that people experience when they have to move from their house or job to a supermarket, or when someone can&rsquo;t supply their home products easily because of a disability.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What it does?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Its a mobile app that lets you make supermarket purchases from a simple and intuitive interface and also it will be available to have in your home. Many offers will be announced there posted by different shops, where you can choose the most attractive one, so you can decide between saving time, saving money or both.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How I built it:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We will use tools like the IBM BLUMIX and Android's SDK.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Challenges I ran into:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The lack of confidence that exists when people use their credit card to carry out transactions by Internet. People who don&rsquo;t like to share personal information and the gap between those who don&rsquo;t know how to use new technologies.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Help people save time and money that can be invested in other things more important.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What I learned:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We learned the virtues of IBM BLUEMIX, we solidified the knowledge in mobile apps.
                </p>

                    What's next for Market.co:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Improve our offer, moving to something more than home products.
