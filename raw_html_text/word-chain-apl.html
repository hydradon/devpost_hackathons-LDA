                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Word Chain is a fun family game, that has come a long way since it was first published. Today, we are enhancing the game by adding visual elements.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game (without APL) was part of another Alexa challenge, in case you are interested you can find it here:

                </p>
                <p>
                    With the latest changes we take advantage of the APL features we have on supported devices to display relevant information about the game in progress, like what was the last word, the letter that the next word should start, the length of the chain so far and when the game ends, the whole chain with words.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is built with Node.js using the Alexa Skills Kit SDK, based on Amazon Lambda. Developed firstly through the authoring tool, then tested through the simulator and finally on a Echo Show 2nd Gen device

                    Adapting existing ask sdk v1 source to the new v2 directives. However this guide was great -

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The way the visual side of the skill was implemented is like a progressive enhancement. Users can still experience the skill to its maximum using only voice and only speaker.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    APL is slick and designing for multiple devices is easy.
