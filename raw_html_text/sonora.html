                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever wanted to have an Instagram or Snapchat filter that reacts in real-time to the sound around you? Imagine being at a live concert, and capturing a an Instagram Story of your favourite band. Sonora will generate a beautiful and interactive spectrum visualization which will react to the music in real-time. Sonora allows you to take your social media and AR content to the next level by bringing sound to the forefront!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using you device's built-in mic, it analyzes the sound data in real-time and generates an interactive frequency spectrum.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app in Unity with the ARCore and ARKit plugins. The underlying mechanism of the frequency spectrum is a Fast Fourier transform algorithm which analyzes raw sound data and outputs a windowed spectrum.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of us had barely any experience developing in Unity. The biggest challenge was learning the environment and trying to create the UI for the spectrum within an AR app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get the visual spectrum to work in real-time with mic audio, which in itself was a big challenge since we had no familiarity with the Unity platform nor AR. Although we did not manage to finish the UI, we are happy that we at least have a basic working prototype of our concept.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned some new basics of Unity and AR dev!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sonora
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to make a more interactive UI, and integrate the app into social media apps such as Instagram, Snapchat, or Facebook.
