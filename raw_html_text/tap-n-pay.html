                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tilt was an existing system that deals with peer-to-peer payment, and now is gone. Interac is leveraged to fix this issue by how they're connected to banks to make direct deposits and have an API to solve this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The money requester picks from their contacts list which sends the required information needed for Interac's money_request API call, a URL is produced and sent through NFC. The payer then taps on the phone to get that URL and fulfils the payment process through their banking institution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Android Studio for Request and Pay there were two separate Activities created. The API REST calls were  made through Java. Contact's List was stored on the API(white-list).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned from scratch because no one had experience with NFC communication protocols and development on Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How development on Android studio works and the REST API that interac had to offer.
