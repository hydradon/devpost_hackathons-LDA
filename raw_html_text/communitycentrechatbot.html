                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As children growing up in the GTA, out parents strives to give us a active and entertaining childhood. However, as many
immigrants from non-English speaking countries can relate to, navigating through all the programs that a community 
has to offer can be difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we're Solving
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Toronto Community Centres website is difficult to navigate, involving a complex 10 step search. We were inspired to create this chatbot as a potential function for the City of Toronto to include on their website or Facebook page
to allow for easier navigation of activities. This would be beneficial for people who struggle to understand
English, as well as for those who are not tech savvy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we Used
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Azure Bot Service to create the chatbot. The benefits of using the Bot Service include being able to
easily implement the chatbot in Facebook or on a website/app, as well as having potential to implement LUIS. Also, to edit the code, we used Visual Studio Code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we faced when creating the chatbot was setting up the Azure Bot Service environment. The environment required several other downloads, and we encountered some errors when connecting the Bot Service to the downloaded programs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Future Steps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Including more activities, improving the filter and including more languages.
