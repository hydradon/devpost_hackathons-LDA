                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The millions of suffering Americans stuck under Trump.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows customers to insure themselves against the rule of a tyrannical political leader. If a customer insures themselves against the rule of a particular election candidate, then in the event that that candidate wins the upcoming election, TyrannyEscape auto books them a flight out of the country, using the SkyScanner API, within 12 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built by Mack - using python with the Skysanner API.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finding a way to scrape the internet for betting odds on upcoming election candidates.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There aren't that many left wing world leaders right now...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TyrannyEscape
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going global! And finding betting odds for election candidates further afield than Europe, so that TyrannyEscape can insure those with even more at stake in their leadership elections than us here in the West.
