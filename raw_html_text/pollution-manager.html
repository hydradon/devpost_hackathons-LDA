                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a recent conference held in France about the current status of the climate crisis, a concerning statistic came out which stated that we had only 12 years left to drastically reduce our carbon emission and prevent catastrophic climate consequences. As a group, we figured that the best way to move towards positive change was to inform as many people as we could about the severity of this crisis and what they can do on their own to help reduce their carbon emissions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a web app that allows users to answer questions related to how often they use regular household appliances. The app also gives the user information on how much carbon is emitted by each appliance and alternatives to using them to make a change.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One major challenge we faced in the process of creating our web app was adding a drop down menu to collect user input regarding how often they use different household appliances. Our web app required us to use both CSS and HTML and implement them into each other which was difficult because we're unfamiliar with these programming languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully navigated how to use entirely new programming languages that we were unfamiliar with which is an accomplishment in itself. We used various animations to add a dynamic element to our web page and to make it more interactive with the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not only did we learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during this whole proceess but we also learned how to organize ourselves and work together as an efficient team.
                </p>

                    We want to expand the reach of our website by targeting those in power and voters.
