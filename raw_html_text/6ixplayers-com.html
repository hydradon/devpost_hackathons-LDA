                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My partner and I love to play sports. Naturally,
                    <strong>
                        we are upset
                    </strong>
                    when we're ready to play however can't find people to play with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the problem described above, we decided to create an
                    <em>
                        incentive-based game organizing platform
                    </em>
                    .
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea with this is to have users of the platform post a challenge (such as a 1 v 1 basketball match at the local park) for players within the same relative location to view and accept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What makes this more attractive than traditional ways of organizing is that RivalWe offers the option of placing a bet on your win. In other words, you and the other player(s) can put in a pool, for example, $5 each. The
                    <strong>
                        winner receives the pool of funds
                    </strong>
                    deposited (and our application
                    <em>
                        takes a transaction fee for acting as an escrow
                    </em>
                    service). This is different from gambling as it relies on skill rather than chance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case of disputes, we have our standard procedure to resolve them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using StdLib, we powered our backend. Using PLAID and HERE API's we powered our payment processing and maps respectively. For the frontend, we used React and Materialize CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting Firebase with StdLib was a major challenge. On the first day, 2 of our group members left so we had to account for carrying out the tasks that were assigned to the others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning about the Standard Library, making beautiful design using Materialize, pulling through despite the slight setbacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StdLib, HERE API, PLAID API, Materialize CSS, 2-factor authentication using Twilio.
