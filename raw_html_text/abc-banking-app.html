                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I love to travel and I have traveled to some very beautiful place throughout the world but the problem with traveling is use your country's currency when you do not reside in the country that you are visiting, which can make your daily traveling very difficult. Therefore, that is why I decided to create this mobile application that includes a prototype to test the this banking mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This banking mobile application lets users deposit, transfer, and withdraw foreign currency, cash, checks, and bitcoin into their checking, savings, and credit account without having to pay a visit to a bank. That way users are able to create account where users can deposit, transfer, and withdraw foreign currency, bitcoin, cash, and checks to their checking, savings and credit account to purchase and pay without calling your bank when visiting other countries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Utilizing Adobe XD to create low to high fidelity wireframes of the banking mobile application that is user-centered to create the prototype to conduct usability testing to correct errors and to ensure that the banking mobile application is user-centered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges that I ran into is the coding for the mobile application. I am familiar with web development and I am not sure how I will proceed with developing this into a mobile application. Luckily, I don't have to code a mobile application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That I actually designed and created a mobile application that will do good for the world. Plus, this mobile banking application will make international traveling and banking easier for individuals that travel outside of their countries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that this mobile application can achieve a lot for those who do enjoy traveling but don't want to deal with the foreign currency conversion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ABC Banking App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, I enjoy traveling to other countries that are outside the United States of America and that is why I came up with this mobile banking application. When I travel to other countries, I always dread having to deal with calling my bank when I arrive in a foreign country because it is a hassle.
