                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mafia is a fun party game to play, but sometimes complicated to GM in-person. We attempted to make a server to simplify the experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The engine uses python, communicating to clients through javascript in a browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Python's SocketServer, Rice University's wifi limiting our direct connections through IP addresses.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really pushed ourselves learning skills we didn't have before. We didn't finish, but we learned a lot about simple servers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mafia Server
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to finish it in our own time in the near future.
