                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often times at networking events, we end up wanting to create meaningful connections with other professionals in the our industries. However, the process with looking up users, asking whether this is the correct one, and even failing to find the person among a large group of John Doe's is not an effective way to network with others when we're wasting time fumbling through the search results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SQR works by building individual profiles for users who can update them with their corresponding usernames and social media accounts. When you want to connect to another user, you utilize the scan feature to scan his/her unique QR code to access his/her profile. This method streamlines the process and can allow users to quickly connect through multiple social media sites in less time it would have taken to just connect on one.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the challenges I ran into was accessing mobile cameras through the browser. Since this is a web app, I could not easily access the camera from the browser. I was able to figure out how to get the front and rear camera feeds for android devices, but, unfortunately, iPhone's restrict the direct access to their cameras from the browser.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of creating a very clean and functional application that can be used by everyone looking to network.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot through the process of this hackathon.

                    What's next for SQR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What's next is to create native mobile apps so that additional features can be added and most importantly to bring in iPhone users to the mix.
