                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm a Jr. Developer fresh out of school and I wanted to build a fun portfolio project to get my name out there a bit. So I built the 1.0 site and felt very happy about it, a few friends really liked it and I was happy. Then I posted it to reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful and it took off people all over the world started writing articles about it including TIME, Gizmodo, mental_floss and many more. When I saw the Hackathon I thought this would be the perfect submission.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My Burrito Finder does exactly that, it finds burritos in your area just that simple.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Much like any other modern website I built it with HTML, JavaScript and CSS on the front-end and a bit of PHP to make the API call. I used the JetBrains tool kit PHP Storm for all of my development then debugged in every browser I could but mostly on my iPad.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was a way for me to become more familiar with making API calls and working with Google Maps so there was a bit of a learning curve at the beginning. After that my focus was to keep the project as simple as possible so I ran into a few issues keeping the CSS to a minimum while still being friendly on all platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every bit of this project and the success that it has seen, the whole thing has been rather overwhelming.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The obvious things would be the Yelp API, the Google Maps API and working with the Yelp data. But more than that I learned to be prepared for anything, I&rsquo;m just glad the spike in traffic went as smooth as it did.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My Burrito Finder!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I&rsquo;m now developing the mobile app with a few other features for the people who want to help support me and so that I can help cover my costs but I will always make sure that the website stays free.
