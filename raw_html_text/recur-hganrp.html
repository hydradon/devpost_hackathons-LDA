                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From transactions to scheduling, there is so much automation in our lives today. We especially experience this in our finances today as college students, for example, auto-paying subscriptions, tuition, and handling monthly rent payments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We sent out a survey to the hackathon participants, and in this room, over 50% of us don&rsquo;t know exactly how much we are spending on recurring payments, and over 20% of us don&rsquo;t manage them at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In most cases, we don&rsquo;t really manage these payments all in one place. Sometimes we use venmo to manually transfer money for rent or utilities, or have payments for subscriptions scattered across different bank accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, there&rsquo;s not an elegant solution out there right now to manage all recurring payments and help a user edit, delete, or add payments across their financial accounts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What is Recur?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recur is a financial management app that allows a user to view their recurring payments on their financial accounts (such as PayPal, Venmo, or banking apps). What sets Recur apart is that we can set recurring payments to an individual--which is extremely helpful in cases where you might be splitting rent with roommates, or sharing a subscription. Recur takes the hassle out of subscription payment management, but also allows clear communication about where you&rsquo;re spending the most, and on what.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we used and the Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Figma to create high-fidelity prototypes and animations. Since both our developers were using Windows operating systems, it was easier to make an Android app compared to an IOS app. Using Android-Studio, Java, Json, and Firebase, our developers were able to create a working backend that would store data on Firebase regarding recurring payments. One of the largest challenges with this project coding wise, was that mobile app development was completely new to our developers and they had much learning to do on the spot. Although the technical prototype of the app is very simple, the potential it holds to change the lives of people in the future is still just as bright. With the 3 brilliant designers on the team, our app Recur was prototyped with design tools and can fully show what the final product could look like and how it can impact the lives of our users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to handle a broader scope, creating refined deliverables from UX Research (cognitive walkthroughs, empathy mapping, outreach questionnaires), end-to-end-product design (ideation, iteration, aligning with eng, prototyping), identity branding and visual systems, to attempting full-stack development (data structures and also front end), marketing, competitive analysis, product-market fit, scaling, and feasibility, we have put thought into every aspect of the product necessary in order for our startup to roll out as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The future of Recur
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step will be to connect Recur with current mainstream mobile banking or money transfer apps like Bank of America, Chase, Venmo, Paypal, etc. By collaborating with all these platforms, Recur will be able to fully integrate with our users lives to make managing their recurring payments, from anyone to anything, as simple as a button click. Ideally, by using AI we can even further simplify the lives of our users by tracking their banking information and letting them know if they have any additional hidden recurring payments and how to best manage their finances. This way Recur can truly allow users to feel less stress and more control over their spending.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, we hold strongly to our mission to help empower all to understand personal finances with clarity and transparency, while catalyzing positive change in spending habits.
