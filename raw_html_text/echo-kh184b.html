                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our experience with immigrants and tourists facing the language barrier with no real tools to overcome this problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Echo uses a speech recognition API to suggest correct replacement phrases for grammatically incorrect phrases.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using an API to listen to and interpret the text, then using a wide database to suggest correct expression.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The APIs were hard to access, with multiple technical errors occurring.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea's originality and basis would be extremely helpful in today's world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained valuable experience with using and applying APIs and website extensions, and designing a clean UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Echo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We could extend our database to include trends in grammatical errors from other ethnicities so Echo could cater to a wider range of people. We could also include a grammatical interpretation API for more accuracy in suggestions.
