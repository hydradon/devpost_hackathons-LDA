                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a woman in STEM, we wanted to show our experiences growing up, to reveal why so many young girls are turned away from pursuing STEM. Through our virtual reality project, the user will be able to place themselves in little girls shoes, to understand what discouragement they go through. We hope to bring light to these issues, to hopefully create change, and make sure that girls are encouraged to pursue whatever their dreams are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app puts the user in a virtual world, where they are faced with both compliments and insults that girls face as they try and pursue the STEM field. The user tries to capture all of the compliments, which hopefully will encourage them to pursue STEM, and gaze at the insults, to shoot them away and show how they don't affect the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Unity, and coded in C#. We also used leap motion technology, and the Oculus headgear.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the hackathon was only 24 hours, we had to cut down on a lot of features, to make the app feasible to create. Also, most of our group was beginners in virtual reality, and all of us had never worked with the Oculus and leap motion technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our app, because it simulates something that we have all gone through, and we hope that the world will receive our message, and learn to be more conscious of their words, and how it affects the upbringing of young girls.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about virtual reality, especially with the Oculus and leap motion. We also learned a lot about Unity, and the C# language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for vr oculus leap motion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add different stages of life, to show the insults that come along in each passage of life. We would also like to have the insults thrown at the user. We would also like to be able to walk around the virtual reality land, which we were limited too because of the length of the leap motion wires.
