                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spent hours playing games like Boxheads, games that have a simple premise: don't die, and take as many of the bad guys with you as you can, as well as atmospheric horror games such as Five Nights at Freddy's and Alan Wake.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The premise of Daybreak is simple: You're trapped in a house, and Vampires are coming for you. Survive as long as possible, gaining new weapons along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The slack2d library allowed us to use a language we're all familiar with (Java) alongside the raw power of the openGL libraries. We initially planned on using XNA and Visual Basic, but technical difficulties led us towards this cross-platform solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of the art for this game was crafted by our team during the course of the hackathon. This includes player/enemy sprites, floor, door, and wall tiles, as well as menu and Game Over screens.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Daybreak
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The team plans to continue incremental development for Daybreak, adding new sounds, weapons, and game modes. In particular, we want to add ranged weapons (crossbows!) and delve deeper into vampiric lore (can they enter this house uninvited? What if we uncover some running water?...). We'd also like to add a final boss for an additional challenge.
