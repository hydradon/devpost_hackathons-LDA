                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration is that climate change is a big problem that will affect the future generations of this Earth. The Earth is warming up everyday, and we want to provide a way of visualizing previous data and predicting future trends, so that we can see where we are heading together as a species on planet Earth.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently our front-end depicts some sample data found on the nivo.rocks website, and is charted using their api. We also have our own React components surrounding the map that we depicted.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end was built using React.js and the nivo.rocks framework. Nivo.rocks helped us chart some sample data and present it in a map fashion. Our back-end was supposed to take CVS files and we were supposed to have the tensorflow ML library analyze these files to understand historical data trends and pass it onto the front-end.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    However, I know we could have probably accomplished more. This was my first time being overnight at a hackathon, and it turns out my productivity level really tanks when I am tired and out of energy.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud of my final project that I did during my internship over the summer. I developed a system to automatically run change scripts during deployment of code. I had two weeks to complete this project, and after completion, I had an employee come up to me and say that he didn't expect me to finish the project at all. This made me proud of my work ethic and ability to work efficiently. I am also proud of being on the robotics team at Gonzaga University, being the lead of the Embedded Systems team, and proud of an LCD implementation that I made.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to use React.js for the first time, and I also learned how to style better with CSS. I have always been a server-side developer, mainly comfortable with C/C++, C#, and Java. During my internship, I was on the platform engineering team, where we were in charge of back-end services for different products and websites. To contrast with this, I have never really delved into the client-side world of web development, so it was nice to learn how React.js works, and learn from my team member who has done a web development bootcamp. I also learned more about how to make better styling choices using CSS.

                    What's next for climate-impact-visualization
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we would probably continue to debug why tensorflow and our server-side code didn't end up working in the first place, and hopefully have that set up to have a full stack project.
