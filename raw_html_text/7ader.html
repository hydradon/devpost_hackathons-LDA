                    7ader is a Web/Mobile application that simply let's a student scan a QR code that is owned by the professor of a class to confirm their presence in said professor's lecture. This Multi-user application works on two fronts; from a professor's perspective to a student's, this app will revolutionize the way students preform their daily college activities since everything is now saved and ready to be looked at, therefore no more faking one's presence and thus no more corruption in between the new and upcoming generation.
