                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have many books covered with dust on our bookshelfs and have no clue what to do with them. At the same time we haven't got enough money to buy new ones that we are interested in. So we figured out how to earn a little bit money for letting people read our books - and also borrowing by cheap prices books that we wanna read.
We are excited by that idea - it can be used by milions of users around the world! We see great potential in our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lending:
Users can share their books in exchange for small amount of money.
Users can create their own library with books that they want to lend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Borrowing:
Users can search books using many filters (e.g. title, author, genre).
Users can sort results by distance, price and rating of lending user.
Users can see results on the map.
Users can send requests for a book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can rate each other - after transactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an Android app using Android Studio. 
We wanted to make it beautiful, so we were using Material Design principals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What if one person borrow's a book from somebody and give it back with a little damage? The owner of the book says that he doesn't want it back because it's damaged and want money for that. On the other hand we have second person which says that book is in pretty good condition and claims that nothing happend. So what we should do in that kind of situation?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have got some ideas, but they are not perfect and we are still wondering about it.
                </p>

                    We learned how to place ourselves in our users cases - we had to figure out solutions for real problems that could have take place. We also started to use Material Design principals to increase good-look of our app.
