                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired from many difficulties that we encounter as students to communicate with our professors effectively. Due to the busy schedule of most professors and also students, We barely find free time for both of us to discuss certain issues or any important thing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ASM stands for Algerian Student Manager and it manages the daily schedule as well as the weekly schedule of students. It facilitates the communication between the students and their professors, and also between students themselves by providing a friendly and easy to use platform.
Moreover, students can browse all the lectures posted by the lecturers of the modules they take and the exams corrections of that module and many other important notes related to that module.
Furthermore, students can contact directly their professors and ask them important question that they otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t be able to ask in person.
Also, students can see a list of other students from the same group, and they can contact them easily to ask question. And there&rsquo;s also a forum for students from the same group where they can discuss things about classes or some difficulties they ran into in hope that someone else would help finding the answer.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is based on MVC architecture
The MODEL: side is devleoped using the hibernate framework
The front-end (VIEW): was built using HTML5 CSS3 and JAVASCRIPT es5.
The CONTROLLER: we have not finished
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As most Hackathon participants, we ran into some inevitable problems such as, the inability to finish some features of the application like the group forum and the lectures and corrections browsing and the contacting feature. That was due to poor time management.
As for the backend the problems were the Hibernate configuration in the project using NetBeans IDE
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we created an intuitive front-end and a user-friendly interface for students and professors to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that the basis of every successful project is time management and team working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ASM
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are looking forward to develop our application and implement all its features as soon as possible and make it available for students and professors to use.
