                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone in the team is interested in machine learning and getting into grad school. This led us to develop a machine learning algorithm that we could potentially use to predict our own grad school admissions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found it fascinating that we could potentially predict the probability of getting into graduate school based on several factors. The user inputs their data, based on which our algorithm outputs a probability.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded multivariable linear regression from scratch on Python using the numpy library and then used JavaScript to build our website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We faced a very steep learning curve with both machine learning and web development. Normalizing our data was very important to obtain stable results, which we initially did not implement.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fact that our project was successfully completed was very satisfying.
