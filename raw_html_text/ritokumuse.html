                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Self gamification applications. Brainstorming activities on how to motivate kids.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows one user, like a parent, set up quests that correspond to real life activities for other users, that result in virtual rewards and optional physical rewards.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used NativeScript for its easy availability and testability. We attempted to start with Angular libraries, but then determined our group members would be more comfortable using straight JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Attempting to integrate separate integral parts of the application together was giving us a significant amount of difficulty.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thorough process and planning stage that helped us create a reasonable user interface. Some working individual parts of the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NativeScript, some TypeScript and Angular, and more practice with JavaScript and HTML.
                </p>
