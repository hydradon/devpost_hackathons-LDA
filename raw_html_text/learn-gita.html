                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was reading the book and thought it was fun to have it as a voice skill
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gives you quotes, stories from Gita and allows you to test yourself by taking the quiz.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Voiceflow
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first time trying the Alexa skill and the only challenge was learning gaps and not enough documentation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created an in-skill purchase skill, and I didn't have any previous knowledge so I am happy with what I accomplished.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Slots can be confusing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Learn Gita
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will add lot of new content so that people have something new to know about Gita.
                </p>
