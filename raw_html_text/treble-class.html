                    Finland routinely tops world rankings for education systems due to their exemplary music education system. Music is a mandatory subject for students in the first seven years of their schooling. There is no set national curriculum, and music teachers adapt the course to the needs of individual students.

                    According to the European Network for Communication and Knowledge Management in the field of Music Education: &ldquo;Development of the learner&rsquo;s musical expression through playful and integrating activity is central. The instruction... encourages them to express themselves and give real form to their own ideas.&rdquo; Music is an integral part of Finnish education.

                    The effect of music education on a student&rsquo;s educational experience and learning capabilities cannot be overstated. Music increases:
spatial-temporal skills, improves test scores, and enhances the learning process by enhancing early cognitive development.

                    However, music education is largely inaccessible to many communities. Instruments can easily cost a few thousand dollars, and musical lessons can cost hundreds of dollars per week. Many families cannot afford a musical education, putting low-income children at a huge disadvantage.
