                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa struggles to send requests across varies networks and on its own local network without dedicated hardware.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Talk to Alexa, this the communicates with AWS and sends a HTTP request to a node.js server (Also on AWS), This request then updates a server side variable which can then be read by a raspberry pi in order to change it GPIO from any internet connected network.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started with learning to program a basic Alexa skill.
I then attempted to allow Alexa to communicate directly with Raspberry Pi on local network (Alexa doesn&rsquo;t like doing this).
I then created a node.js server on AWS which could route requests from Alexa to the Raspberry Pi.
I enabled Alexa to send HTTP requests to the node.js server.
The raspberry Pi was then programmed to use a GET request to get data from the server.
I then built a basic circuit to demonstrate the functionality
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa doesn&rsquo;t like to communicate locally, instead Alexa likes to run all commands as if external (running from AWS). Accessing a raspberry Pi from the internet on the university network isn&rsquo;t possible so I created a node.js server hosted at AWS to allow me to get information from Alexa.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa isn&rsquo;t very good for debugging.

                    Size down and increase functionality.
