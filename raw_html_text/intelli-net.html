                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not every company can afford a dedicated security engineer.  We can use Watson to help fill in the gap!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Automates and demystifies network security auditing and patching.  Watson prompts the user to enter the IP address of the system, or IP range of the network to be tested.  We use a shell script to run nmap scans, and then Watson queries CVE databases to make recommendations for patches or remediation.  In only the most severe cases, Watson will recommend that the user consult with a security professional.  This brings value to small and medium business customers who can't afford a dedicated SOC, and acts as a valuable introduction to network scanning and CVE research for the uninitiated.  Over time, as Watson's available dataset grows, we should be able to execute predictive modeling for likely compromises, and eradicate those vectors before they become a serious issue.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Python, BASH, nmap, and a combination of IBM Cloud Services
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall architecture, connecting all the components, working as a team of 2 vs 4
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall architecture, creating the components, working as a team of 2 vs 4.  Most significantly, this is a useful tool worthy of further exploration and iteration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A great deal about architecture, scoping, and logical evaluation of same.  Navigating unmet-dependency-hell in the eleventh hour.  That two women are capable of initializing a powerful idea in &lt; 36 hours!

                    What's next for intelli-net
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Code clean-up, connecting the components, more features using Watson's vast array of capabilities (particularly Discovery).  This can also be adapted for a product that would scan a user's home network and evaluate various connected devices for vulnerabilities.
