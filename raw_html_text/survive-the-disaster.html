                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Honestly a mix of point-click adventure games, Roblox, and educating players what to do before, during, and after a natural disaster.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a 2D game where players will have to accomplish the goals before an Earthquake occurs. We couldn't implement a flood and wildfire scenario.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Splitting off into sub teams of two
Angel and Guillermo worked on UI elements and sprites While they were working on that Nicole and I focused on animations and game mechanics using C# scripts
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating Smooth UI Elements
We had to change character movement from Mobile to Standard Key-presses
Creating all original art
Making a inventory system
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making over 60 sprites
Adding most of the mechanics we wanted however, some don't work quite right.
It was all of our first time creating a game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How a lot of the built-in methods in Unity work
A lot of tricks and shortcuts to manipulating gameObjects
How to code in teams and using Github to share scripts
Game design has so many elements to account for taught us some time management
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Survive the Disaster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely going to be continuously worked on until the ideas are complete. It was a lot of fun and we would love to see it grow. Probably will be released on the android play-store just to make it more accessible to other friends who may be interested in being a beta tester.
