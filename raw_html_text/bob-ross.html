                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the works of Bob Ross and wanted to make something in his style, but adapted to be able to be viewed as a panorama
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a scrolling landscape with trees, rivers, clouds, and mountains placed thoughout the enviroment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Flask Framework to generate the locations of each of the objects in the enviroment, with the html and css making the objects show how I wanted them to appear
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Really it was an issue figuring out how to place all of the objects on the page, and making sure that everything could only be generated in a location that made sense
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm really happy with how the entire landscape looks as a whole, and how everything came together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with Flask, creating a page that horizontally scrolls instead of vertically
                </p>
