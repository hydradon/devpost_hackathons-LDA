                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build an app that that entices people to explore their cities and help them discover new areas and hidden gems that they may not have visited otherwise
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app encourages people to get out and explore their cities by providing landmarks for them to explore. Once a user hits a landmark, they are rewarded with a snapchat sticker, which they can use to share their adventures with their friends. Users can get higher tier stickers called badges and trophies by hitting different milestones along their adventures. The collection of these stickers and badges encourage users to visit get out more in the name of friendly competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Google Maps and Google Location Services to track and display our user's location as well as the location of the landmarks. We're using SnapKit to export our stickers to snapchat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of our issues were the run-of-the-mill android issues, such as permissions, build issues, etc. SnapKit was extremely intuitive and the least of our worries for most of the night.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we were able to come together and make something in the span
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to develop using SnapKit, as well as a familiarizing ourselves with android studio and caffeine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StickerBook
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If StickerBook expands, we hope to provide more tangible prizes than stickers, more intricate ways of discovering areas than geolocation, and possibly work with those who are interested in sponsoring locations or events to appear on StickerBook.
