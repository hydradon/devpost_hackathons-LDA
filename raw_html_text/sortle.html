                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind Sortle was the education/awareness category which lead us to come up with a website that educates people on why, how, and where they should recycle things; even less conventional things like electronics. We also wanted to make it accessible for robots and regular people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sortle scans objects held to the webcam by the user in order to direct them to a recycling or e waste center near them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thanks to the existence of JavaScript and Abir's experience with it, we were able to develop a scanner that tells you what things are recyclable or can be composted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into were actually coming up with the idea. At first we came up with a game idea with a similar concept but that did not work out properly. Being able to come up with such a helpful application for robots and humans alike.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of how well the machine vision is able to detect objects and classify if they can be composted or recycled. That function had to be manually inputted which took a lot of time and effort. We are also proud of our logo which really puts a lot of perspective to our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that every great idea is team work. We learned to work on ideas to make this website a lot more inclusive and useful to better impact the world. A project such as this can make a really big footprint.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Sortle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Soon enough, we hope to integrate a high-quality text to speech which allows those who are visually impaired to be a part of this progressive era. With enough time, we hope to extend this website into an application for easier use.
