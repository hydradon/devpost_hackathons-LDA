                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to a widening gap regarding information between small entrepreneurs, either for-profit or non-profit, we've developed a platform that pairs them with investors based on matching criteria (e.g. mentorship, funds, stage of business). In particular, we've targeted entrepreneurs in lower-income counties of texas in order to help them, and their county, achieve financial self-sufficiency.
