                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We knew that a lot of people don't like to just study in their room, but it can also be a huge pain to try and find a place that isn't busy sometimes. We decided to help people with that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It creates a heatmap at different locations to indicate how busy they are at the current time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android studio and Google's Map API in our program to let people scroll and search the area around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of homework from school, and we had to manage our time between that and the project we were working on carefully. Moreover, two of our members were sick, and had to constantly take breaks in order to be able to work.
Furthermore, 4 hours of our time was lost trying to configure a faulty DragonBoard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A relatively successful completion of the project as a rookie team, even though we faced several difficulties.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work as a team, and also to set our priorities better in future times. We also acquired a lot of knowledge in Google Map SDK, Android Studio, and AWS Framework implementation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Study in Peace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we will develop a fully functional back end which would interact with an IoT network, and would not just be limited to a single College Campus.
