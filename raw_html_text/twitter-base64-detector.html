                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since it was our first hackathon we decided to see if we could take on the first project idea from the presentation made by Alifya from Chevron.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tool is able to detect base64 encoded strings in a tweet given a username.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build the tool we used Python which we ran on a virtual machine so that we could both work on the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One big problem was trying to use Java to program with the Twitter API. We had to abandon doing that idea and ended up learning Python instead. Understanding how the Twitter API worked was also tricky and took us a while to figure this out since we had no prior experience programming with an API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Python and the Twitter API from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Python and the Twitter API, and more about using Github. We also learned what base64 strings were and why they are important.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Twitter Base64 Detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add another command line argument to account for date, which will help for users with a lot of tweets. The tool would find all tweets for only a specified date instead of every single tweet they have ever made. 
Add the ability to detect base64 strings within pictures.
