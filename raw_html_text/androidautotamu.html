                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to use commonly available devices to help individiuals hurt in automotive accidents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It detects rapid deceleration of more than 2 G forces (Roughly a 45 mph car accident) and promps the user to ensure they are okay.  If the user fails to respond the app will (hopefully) call for help.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We coded the app in Android Studio and used their android emulator to simulate the sensor data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was quite difficuilt for us to get an accurate measurment of acceleration over time as opposted to instantanious acceleration.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of our ability to use sensor data in a program!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned loads about Android API and how to manipulate sensor data!
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully to complete the interface and to implement the functions that will contact help if the user fails to respond!
