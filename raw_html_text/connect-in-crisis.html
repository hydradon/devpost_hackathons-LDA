                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was inspired by addressing the need for people to not only address checkpoint in order to mark their safety; but to also connect others to their community.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the model, the web application
                    <em>
                        Connect in Crisis
                    </em>
                    allows people, upon input of their zipcode, allows them to then identify checkpoints at local schools, churches or community centers, in which community members are aggregating. By pulling from Google Map's API, end users are able to identify community centers, and first responders/moderators are able to alter community center/safety checkpoint location.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using HTML, CSS, Javascript, R, SQL lite, and Amazon Web Services to build out the back-end and front-end processes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Identifying the right technologies to first start the project. Also being able to scale the project to something accomplishable within the next 24 hours was essential. Next, being able to assign responsibilities for each team member for both back and front-end responsibilities was quite difficult. There were a lot of "dead-ends" and constant redirecting of solutions.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to reach such progress with little to no experience in Javascript and others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A LOT! From the new skills using to build and also a big learning curve.
                </p>

                    What's next for Connect in Crisis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to complete the database for the server and connecting the front and back end.
