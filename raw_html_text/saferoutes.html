                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have noticed that there is a large presence of crime in Baltimore, MD and were wondering how people got home safely. We wanted to leverage the power of big data to help others get to their desired destination safely.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user defines their desired destination and the app will then reveal alternative directions. All directions will be labeled either green or red to indicate whether that path is safe or not.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We implemented a modified version of Dijkstra's Algorithm, by giving weights to the different paths we were able to generate. The weights were determined by the amount crime that has occurred throughout that path. The path with the lowest weights will be labeled green while the paths with the higher weights will be labeled red.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our team members left the group without any notification. Although we were understaffed, we were still able to produce a working product.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Determining optimal routes for the desired destination and applying weights to different paths.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to solidify our understanding of Dijkstra's Algorithm and its implementation
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SafeRoutes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to further optimize our algorithm to determine the shortest yet safest paths and make the UI more user-friendly and lighter for faster performance. We plan to ship the app to the app store.
