                </h2>
                <p>
                    Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a disease with an increasing prevalence and the main cause of blindness among working-age population. The risk of severe vision loss can be significantly reduced by timely diagnosis and treatment.
The current process of testing for diabetic retinopathy is laborious and often inefficient and the scope of detecting the diseases in the early stages are completely unexploited. There exists a need for a powerful Automated retinal image analysis for early stage Diabetic retinopathy detection
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The tool analyzes the retinal image of a patient to detect whether the patient is affected with Diabetic Retinopathy and if yes, how severe (on a medical scale of 1 to 4; 4 being highest). It is the ultimate tool to aid in precisely detecting the early stages of diabetic retinopathy. .

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The entire application was developed using the Predix infrastructure . The application was build in different layers UI using JavaScript  angular js, html  , Postgre sql database, Data science  algorithm  in python.  We leveraged powerful deep learning algorithms inspired from the way the humans learn.  Convolutional Neural Networks were leveraged to learn from retinal images of several hundred of different severity levels .

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Training  process for the deep learning algorithms were extremely resource intensive, our codes kept running for over 15 hours with no intermediate outputs from predix analytics runtime  . With limited visibility into the analytics processing and time we  ran in to challenges of optimizing  the resource intense algorithms. Our attempt to improve computational efficiency by increasing instances and RAM was also not  successful .
