                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used to work in government accounting. I have always wanted to find some way to make my obscure knowledge of public accounts useful.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Where does my money go?" produces a tree map of the consolidated financial statement of the Government of Ontario. It shows exactly how much money is spent on every program and vendor in the 2014 tax year.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Government of Ontario publishes their public accounts at the end of each fiscal year. In the most recent year, they published these in CSV format. By scanning through the CSV file and procedurally building a JSON file which can interface with 3rd party jQuery libraries, it is possible to graphically show all tax spending.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I finally got to put to use two summers worth of public sector accounting knowledge!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really need to learn how to jQuery!
                </p>
