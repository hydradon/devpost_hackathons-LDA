                <p>
                    Technology helped change the way we live our daily lives. From finding out information lightning fast to learning a new skill from the commodity of your home. Technology has made our lives easier and it's potential is yet to be unlocked. In times where everything is possible, we can help people with disabilities overcome their deficiencies.

                    Sign Language intends to help deaf people communicate with people with no auditive deficiencies. Moreover, our application aims to give a smoother transition, from natural language to sign language, to people that recently lost their hearing or speaking abilities. The core functionalities of the application are Speech to Text transformation and Sign Language recognition. With the help of his smartphone, the person can photograph/film the gestures of the sign language user and receive its textual translation.

                <p>
                    One of the core mechanisms of this application is the sign language recognition. The recognition is achieved through a image classifier written in
                    <strong>
                        Python
                    </strong>
                    . The dataset used for the training is provided by

                        link
                    </a>
                    . The mobile application was developed with the
                    <strong>
                        Android Studio IDE
                    </strong>
                    . The two applications exchange data through a
                    <strong>
                        firebase
                    </strong>
                    database.
