                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Like any University, Rutgers is a university known to have some down time every now and then. This is a way of Keeping track of that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If Sakai goes down, or the campus emergency operating status goes down you can receive a catastrophic tweet from

                        @RUCatastrophic
                    </a>
                    But that's not all. Students can set RUCatastrophic.com as their home page. Whether it's rainy, sunny, windy, or warm. You'll be the first to know. If a campus service goes down, we'll keep you in the loop.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core of this project is python. Every minute Python runs a small script which polls for information from rutgers and weather sources. It then generates a new index.html file reflecting the conditions. It Operates on a Ubuntu Linode image and was designed to be as minimal is possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge I overcame was animating various components of the website and creating a modern look.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since the HTML is as basic as can be it happens to be aesthetically pleasing not just for the pc, but on mobile too.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the help of my friends I learned new ways to apply old concepts through time-sensitive programming.

                    The service could expand by also keeping track of traffic delays around town and informing users when it's congested.
