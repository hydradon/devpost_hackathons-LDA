                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came up with this idea when I realized that online ratings don't always accurately represent the true consumer belief of the restaurant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Originally, We wanted to use Yelp API data to track ratings over time and identify trends in those ratings. We realized a few hours into the project how bad Yelp's API is. We ended up scratching all that we had done and start with Google's Place API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of submission, Ye-p uses Google's Place API and Walmart's Open API to search relevant businesses or products, graph the 5 most recent reviews over time and display other relevant data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using HTML/CSS, Javascript, Ajax, Jquery, Bootstrap and a few other Javascript libraries. GitHub also helped us along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    API's!! They are so much harder to work with than we initially anticipated. We were hoping to get a ton of data from multiple API's, but we ended up with just 3 different sources. A 4th API from BestBuy is in the works but will not be ready by submission time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also went through a number of different languages before deciding on Javascript. We started out with PHP, then switched to Python and Django, then finally to Javascript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team also spent some time on figuring out hosting. We tried AWS and Heroku when we used Django. After we switched to javascript, developing locally over and syncing over GitHub made much more sense.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am impressed with how little sleep I have gotten.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot. I had never worked with such complex API's before. I am by no means an expert now, but I understand how to work with them now. Ajax was also an unfamiliar system, and we are now well-versed in callbacks
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ye-p
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand API's and add more meaningful analytics. We also plan to build a database of review data that will aggregate data over time so that more than 5 reviews could be shown in the future.
