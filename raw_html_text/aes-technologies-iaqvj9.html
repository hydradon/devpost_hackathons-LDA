                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It encrypts a message that the user inputs into a text file which is encrypted using matrix multiplication and the entire text file is encrypted using AES
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built the base code with my team, and found code which helped us implement AES
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AES did not work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got AES to work
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AES is very good
                </p>

                    What's next for AES Technologies
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cloud storage to upload an encrypted file 
To decrypt, user needs otp (one time password) to download and decrypt file
Account system to store files in cloud
