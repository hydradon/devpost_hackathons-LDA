                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many students in the Bronx don't get that much money to spend after school.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How it works is that we use a mobile app for students to find areas around their schools where they can get something to eat with whatever money they have.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenges we ran into with this project include finding an idea that would fit this app and how we would integrate the foursquare api while building this app and how students will be using it.

                <p>
                    An Accomplishment that we are proud of is coming up with the project idea and how the mechanics of this app would work.

                    What we've learned

                <p>
                    We learned that we need a determined team that will not give up.
