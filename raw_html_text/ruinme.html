                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Picture this. What if, instead of having useful Android apps, you had the exact opposite. This app will help no one, but it's a great lesson in data security.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asks for plenty of android permissions, and does its best to ruin your life given whatever you allow it to have. This app shows how much negative impact can be caused by things normal users take for granted.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app is entirely programmed in Java for Android
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Certain Android systems like MMS and Camera access get quite complicated for simple applications.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you let this app do everything it wants to, you will never use your phone again.
                </p>
                <h2>

                    A lot of really interesting niches in the Android SDK
