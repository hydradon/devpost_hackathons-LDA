                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From my personal experience, as an international student, I did not know much about the U.S healthcare system. I had to worry about a hospital bill. Since I don't know any source of this insurance policy, I wasted time and money searching for this information and my problem stills unsolved.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an A.I chatbot to get user input such as their insurance policy, the treatment they received. From this information, it calculates an estimated of the percentage that your insurance will cover for you
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used wit.ai as the NLP source to train the bot of user input. We used Facebook Messenger as our platform and deploy it on ngrok.
