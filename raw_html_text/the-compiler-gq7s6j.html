                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simply enter a search term, the number of videos you want to be compiled, and how long the clip from each video should be, and The Compiler will automatically take clips from the top YouTube videos and merge them into one compilation. Perfect for hearing from many different news outlets, seeing quick clips of cute animal videos, or making Vine compilations without the effort!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the back end with Python, using the YouTube API and moviepy to grab the videos and stitch them together. We then used Flask to build the web page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had many issues trying to make it run faster, and we had reoccurring bugs in the way the video displayed. We had an issue where the audio was lagging, as well. The YouTube API does not filter out livestreams, so we had to work around that, too, without calling the YouTube API more than once per compilation (to save on our api call quota and make it faster).
