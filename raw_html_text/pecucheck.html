                    [HELLO-WORLD-HACK] A budget application optimized for college students.
Going to college is of paramount importance, especially in current times. But, like most other necessities, education comes at a price, and a hefty one at that! Hence, it is imperative that students are cognizant of their expenses. Not only will this help them with financial management in the future, but it will also enable them to minimize superfluous spending while completing their education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And thus was concieved the idea of PecuCheck, a budgeting application optimized for the web and for college students! It is true that similar applications such as
                    <a href="https://www.mint.com/" rel="nofollow">
                        Mint
                    </a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://goodbudget.com/" rel="nofollow">
                        GoodBudget
                    </a>
                    exist and provide an aesthetically pleasing and at the same time, seamless applications for personal financial management. But, upon further research, I discovered that they lacked in one area, i.e., personalization towards college students. This segues us to the principle objective of PecuCheck:
                </p>
                <p>
                    ** To provide undergraduate and graduate students with a personalized way of keeping track of their financial records **

                <p>
                    While this application is far from complete, I do believe that I have done a commendable job in making the app what it is now in a matter of 21 hours. The major improvements that I am looking to provide in the next release will be:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Providing graphical representations of the recommended monetary split.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Associating the existing MongoDB with each of the users by creating a Financial Schema to store all the financial components of the user and thus create a more personalized experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adding authentication by various other O-Auth providers such as Google, Github, Facebook, and Twitter.
                    </li>

                    WHAT I LEARNED
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I was already proficient in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, and jQuery. I had to learn Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and PassportJS. It was a difficult task, and it took me just under 4 hours to understand the structure of an express application and the best file management practices behind it. I would've preferred working with a team, as that allows delegation and leads to less stress.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    CHALLENGES
                </h1>
                <p>
                    File management and package installation were two of the biggest challenges I faced. An express application requires a lot of modules to be installed, and the file directories need to have specific names and must have a specific format. But, once I got the hang of it, my dev. process moved almost twice as fast as now it was just a matter of structuring, styling, and DOM manipulation with HTML, CSS, and jQuery respectively.
