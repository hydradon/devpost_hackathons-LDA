                    We were inspired by the pose estimation model in AAI's API, and saw a lot of potential in tracking movements.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Our app allows users to attempt yoga poses and compares their forms with those of professionals. It then tracks their progression to help them improve.
                </h2>
                <h1>
                    We built it using the always AI pose estimation API to compare a live video to a person in a picture.
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    It was difficult to work with and access our data as the majority of it was done on a Raspberry Pi
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We are proud that we were able to get a working Python server and design an algorithm to compare the skeleton of a human in a live video frame to someone in a picture.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We learned a lot about networks, working with APIs, and using the terminal to run multiple scripts as one cohesive program.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    We hope to patch our bugfixes and move onto better hardware that processes frames at a faster rate. In addition, we want to extend the yoga to more of a guided tutorial rather than just showing the user poses to follow.
