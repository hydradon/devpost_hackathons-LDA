                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We both wanted to try our hand at mobile development and a game seemed like a challenging and interesting way to get started.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game where you have control over your character with the accelerometer for speed and direction and tapping in order to jump.  You must jump through holes in the wall while missiles fly onto the screen to get in your way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with Android-Studio and libgdx as a library for the game related funtions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had absolutely zero prior experience developing for android or mobile at all for that matter, so practically everything.  We mainly had trouble with managing all of the complex components on the screen and their interactions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that within 24 hours we were able to come out with a workable and enjoyable game.  Learning a skill under this much stress and this little sleep makes it an impressive accomplishment to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next time I will likely start with something slightly less ambitious when trying to learn a new technology or language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Missile Jump
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of features that could be added in the future.  One of which being the ability to reduce or increase the jump height depending on how long the user presses their finger on the screen.  Another would be a slightly more smooth interaction for collisions with walls in the game.
