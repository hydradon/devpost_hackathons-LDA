                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Apple's new IOS will make augmented reality ubiquitous in our daily lives. The world is getting tired of Facebook, bored of SnapChat and is done with Instagram. It's time for a new social media experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improve the social experience with mobile technology that creates a hyper localised photosharing environment. It allows friends to share photos and interact in a way never before possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team, we brainstormed use cases for Apple's new ARKit and realized the need for a new social media platform. None of us were very experienced with Swift or Augmented Reality, so we decided this would be a good learning experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First off, one of our members left due to illness. Fortunately he made some great contributions before he left. We had a few Git issues, but ultimately were able to get everything straightened out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a demo using a new technology, learned Git and worked well as a team. Most importantly we had a great time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that merging recklessly is not a smart idea. We also learned that new technologies are exciting but jumping in is quite challenging.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Memospace
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard to say. We have a long backlog of exciting new features such as sharing a memospace with friends, adding reactions and gifs to a memospace. We are also looking to upgrade to a more scalable codebase.
