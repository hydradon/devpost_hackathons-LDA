                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for the project is to be able to find a local restaurant with varieties of choices and quick access.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    This application finds 3 of the closest restaurants of a certain category of food of your choosing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We  used the website called Marvelapp.com to make a prototype
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges we ran into would be finding an idea and making it work, and very unfortunately the website we were using went down for maintenance in the middle of our project. This really set us back but once it came back up we went hard to work and completed what we needed to finish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some accomplishments we are proud of are that we actually made a prototype. We are also proud that we were succesful in finishing the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to implement new things that contributed to our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Find Me Food
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One thing we could add to find me food would be reviews people made personally on find me food. Also maybe a menu for each restaurant.
