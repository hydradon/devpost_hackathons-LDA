                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to Statistics Canada, seniors are expected to comprise around 23% of the population by 2036. Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, where dementia symptoms gradually worsen over a number of years. It is important for seniors to prevent getting dementia or the worsening of dementia symptoms in order to improve their quality of life.
From my personal experience, my 85-year-old grandfather shows dementia symptoms, so I want to build an app that can keep his brain active and also keep him up to date about what I am doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MemorWe is an app created for elderly to battle Alzheimer&rsquo;s. It provides Cognitive activities to the people with a sign of dementia and for those diagnosed with Alzheimer's to exercise their brains in order to prevent or slow down the worsening of dementia symptoms. At the same time, it provides opportunities for the users to recall memories by looking at the photos.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Sketch to design the app which is a UX/UI design.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us has experience with Sketch so we went to a workshop and mentors for help. This is also our first experience with Hackathon and out of three members, one of us has no coding experience while the rest are just beginners.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing our first hackathon and figuring out how to use Sketch and Python during workshops.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use Sketch and diving into the minds of a user to create the best user experience possible.

                    What's next for MemorWe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking the app to the Facebook accounts of the family members so that the family members can share the photo to the app users instantly. The app will ensemble all the photos and create a storybook for the users sharing about family members&rsquo; recent experience.
Implementing AI to analyze the users&rsquo; facial expressions and collect information to predict the worsening of dementia symptoms. Providing feedback to the users&rsquo; families and taking actions to better reduce the worsening of dementia.
