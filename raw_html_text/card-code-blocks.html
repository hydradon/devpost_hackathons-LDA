                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I set out to create a STEM education tool and had the idea of arranging code blocks in AR to control a simple program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ARblox uses a camera to track playing cards and display virtual code blocks on top of them. These code blocks can be arranged to control a simple program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this demo there is a code block displayed on a card which controls moving a character. On the code block there is a virtual button that can be pressed which changes the parameters, allowing the user to move the character for a set amount of time. The character is a Tiger in this example and is also displayed on a card, which has a virtual button to "run" the program. When pressed the Tiger will walk for the specified amount of seconds.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built ARblox using Unity and Vuforia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Communication between the different code blocks and the character was difficult to implement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ARblox
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, I'd like to create additional code blocks which could be chained together to create a more complex program. This could easily be accomplished by "snapping" the blocks together and sending these instructions to the character.
                </p>
