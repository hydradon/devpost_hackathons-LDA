                    Inspiration:
Casey has an interest in embedded systems and decided to come to BitCamp with the idea to build something that represented a turret (as used in the military). Because of his interest in learning more about the C programming language, he has decided to explore the applications of what C can do with hardware. Noah also has a wide range of interest in software development and continues to explore new avenues of coding on an everyday basis.

                <p>
                    How is it built?:

                    B is for Bananas:
The name of the game is to try to take the banana from furious George. Unfortunately, George is constantly watching out for pesky humans who might want to steal his banana. As George's head moves around, try to avoid being seen by him and go for that banana. If George catches you in the act, he will shoot his laser at you and let out a horrid scream for all who dare to to take away his one true love. If you can manage to take the banana from George without him spotting you, you will win all of the glory and all of the banana! Just don't eat the banana, he might not forgive you for that...
