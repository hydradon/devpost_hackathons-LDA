                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WIth 8 Million plastic and paper cups being trashed each day in Switzerland (almost one per person!) we need to be drastic and cut the plastic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While maintaining the convenience of one-way cups, we help you to live green and clean. Buy the coffee in a reusable cup. While enjoying the beverage scan the QR code on the cup for getting the refund as soon as you drop the cup in the queue-free quick-drop bins. No need for new apps: use TWINT or Swisspass or enter your paypal account. The cup gets recognized via RFID, as soon as it is dropped in the bin, which is linked to the QR code. Alternatively return the cup at a coffee store in order to get cash.
