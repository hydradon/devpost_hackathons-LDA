                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost, if not all of, the world's population will eventually find themselves in a situation where they need to quickly access a toilet. This is why Bursting exists: to quickly locate nearby restrooms when nature calls, and to ensure that everyone gets a satisfying, hygienic environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bursting is an app that crowdsources data about the locations of nearby restrooms, and allows users to vote on the quality of their experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The server was built with the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node) stack and is hosted on Google Cloud, and the android application was built with standard Android SDK (Java and XML).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android was by no means cooperative, making our lives extraordinarily painful for 36 hours. Many issues were faced, from allowing smartphones to communicate with servers to dealing with tricky Android nested and inherited interfaces.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making our first working android app from scratch and working through all the bugs as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to access a service through an android application. And that Google is a good thing. A very good thing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Bursting
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can add additional details so that people can be more informed about the accommodations that the restroom provides. Some features such as giving a link to the Google Maps app should be added. We may also provide locations to other utilities, such as water fountains, wifi, etc.
