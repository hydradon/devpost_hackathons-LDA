                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the overwhelming line for food at the Hackathon.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It depicts the greatest challenge we, and possibly everyone else, faced: the battle for food.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to use IGE with a node.js backend, but realized it could be simplied (afterall, it is a fairly simple app) by using phonegap and firebase third party APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working on multiplayer setting was the hardest part- which is one selling point in which we used Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The fun and awesome experience we had working as a team. Creating this app gave us a couple of laughs even while building it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about server processed games. Since we tried to implement a Myo into this game, we discovered the difficulties of using server sided connections with Myo.
