                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    After reading the news and learning that 63 million people are faced with poverty every year in India due to healthcare expenditure alone, I was shocked. I had worked with image recognition and machine learning before so I set out to solve this problem in my own way.

                <p>
                    PocketDoc is an image recognition app to identify physical wounds on the human body and return cures. All you have to do is take a picture of your wound/symptom and then let PocketDoc recognise your wound and return the most common cure or medicine!

                    How I built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    My time on this project was split 50-50. The first half of my time was learning react-native and developing the cross platform interface. Next, I had to learn a bit of machine learning using Clarifai's Image recognition API. I then spent time training my own custom model using predictive analysis to recognise common physical wounds .
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I could not find a working cross-platform camera solution in react native surprisingly so I had to find my way around different tutorials and stack-overflow threads to find an amazing package called react-native-image-picker. This saved me loads of time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am very proud of the fact that I accomplished this task solely on my own. It helped me develop more independence and also develop lots of confidence in my coding ability.

                <p>
                    Right now this app is at a very early stage in development. The minimum viable product has been implemented and everything works. However, in the future I am aiming to reach out to medical research universities and societies and see if I can obtain access to databases of wounds. Then I will feed all images through the image recognition model and this app will be more powerful and more helpful to people in developing countries!
