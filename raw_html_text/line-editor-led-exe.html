                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before I wanted to code the big stuff, I felt I needed to 
create utilities to help me accomplish that. I felt a 
text editor was big enough for me to be a challenge, but
not too daunting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It edits text files line-by-line.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of analyzing files. Lots of calculations based
on these findings. I used most of the standard library
and 2 non-standard libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using all the functions into a single, logical and functional
main() function.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every single one of those functions that I have created
work perfectly under most conditions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating something like this is easy and hard at the same
time.

                    Actually finishing it.
