                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were tired of constantly having to throw out food that we never got to finish, so we decided to make something to help us combat that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fridget keeps track of the elements in your fridge and reminds users which foods are going bad and which are ready to eat.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to create our mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starting off, we were very lost as to how to incorporate our ideas into our app. Our features seemed very overwhelming and we were even close to giving up, but we persevered through and pulled together the main features of our app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We definitely gained valuable problem solving skills. We learned how to create multiple pages and activities within the app for the different functionalities and features that we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fridget
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the future we plan on incorporating additional features that we were not given a chance to add during this hackathon, such as obtaining recipes that use the ingredients found in the fridge, or calculating a weekly grocery budget for students looking to buy groceries.
                </p>
