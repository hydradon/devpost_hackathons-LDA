                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I recently learned computer coding or HTML for the first time from an online website called freeCodeCamp. It led me to realize how many wonderful resources there were online and how learning should not be primarily from a traditional classroom setting. If one wanted to learn something, they could practically do it outside of the classroom through websites, books, or videos. I wanted to create an online platform to guide people to resources no matter what they want to learn. As I was thinking more about the website, I figured that learning is a collaborative effort because when I learned HTML, I often asked my mentor questions about HTML. As a result, I figured that instead of just a plain website, why not make it a social media platform where people can upload and share resources or help each other when they have a question by commenting or encouraging each other or celebrating when one has successfully learned something or liking resources to show how effective they are. I think seeing others learning something and seeing how it is possible to learn something in one's own time can encourage people to start or to keep going through a community effort, uplifting each other. There are many different learning styles, so this will definitely celebrate this factor by allowing for different methods of learning the same thing. Learning is a beautiful thing and I hope spOnge will make things more accessible for people to learn something and to allow for more structure when they are learning rather than shooting in the dark and combing the internet for ways to learn something.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a social media platform for learning where users will be linked to resources that can teach a topic they want to learn about. Users can also share resources or encourage others or answer others' questions. Whether you like learning by yourself or learning with others, there is something for everyone.

                    I used weebly to format a website.

                    I originally was coding in HTML but I realized I was running out of time, so I decided to switch to weebly.
