                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to solve the traffic jam, our main goal is to divide the traffic flow of Snow Mountain Tunnel (SM Tunnel) to other paths in order to ease flow. According to our research, actually have four paths to go to Ilan (including SM Tunnel), and we combine the path options and charity to be the best solution to solve the traffic issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our solution are inspired by the charity mechanism, because charity has a huge influence to make people changing their decision not base on profit. Helping people is a good motivation to choose another paths but to the same destination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product provide a useful information about all the high way and roads between north of Taiwan to east of Taiwan, such as the total time spend to the destination, traffic situation, and     charity contribution points. Base on these information, even other path may also spend 1.5 hr to the Ilan as SM Tunnel but they can enjoy the beautiful view and smooth traffic, the most important thing is we will help traveller donate  small donors to the local organisation which lack of resource or funding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The donation are comes from our advertising revenue, Our advertising partner may comes from local stores, Government Tourism Unit or tourism industry, and other potential organisations.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We face some challenges in technology parts, such as how to make sure user are on the path they choose, how to know which path have more contribution points, and how to analyse the timing, traffic situation, and vehicle speed of each path.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We create a positive ecosystem to help traveller have better traffic experience and they can help people in the same time. We believe in stead of punishing those traveller to go to SM Tunnel, the impact of goodwill will give them better motivation to solve the serious traffic issues together.

                <p>
                    We run agile management in this project, set up the sprint goal every week. Every weekly meeting we review what we done in the last week. Because the use of agile management, we are able to achieve our goal in within the dateline.

                <p>
                    In the beginning of ideas brainstorming, we give many creative ideas to each other, with many attractive functions and funny features, but in the end of discussion, we decide follow the "Simple is the best&rdquo; principle that only give the main useful feature to the user and directly focus on solve the traffic jam issue, it save us a lot of time!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project has the potential to solve the traffic jam in a long run, We could  cooperate with local stores to provide a discount or bonus points mechanism to the user who choose another path to avoid traffic jam in Snow Mountain tunnel in the future. By doing so, driver will have stronger motivation to drive another path in order to get the benefits, doing charity, and avoiding jam in the same time.
