                    Our inspiration is our kids, their interest in geology. They have a large collection of rocks and minerals. We constantly debate over the origins of their samples. They wanted to have a simple way to classify a rock and find its name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we created a Rock ID - Alexa skill, which helps to identify a rock interactively, by asking questions and listening to the answers. At the end, it tells you the name of the rock and its type, if it is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built it on Amazon Alexa platform with Node.js, JavaScript and AWS lambda.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part was the voice interface design. It makes you think differently about the interaction with the machine. We wanted to make it very natural like a conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We've learned a lot about Alexa and AWS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our next steps is to extend Rock ID to Echo Show and Echo Spot devices.
