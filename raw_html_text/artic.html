                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We looked into the psychology of what
                    <strong>
                        really
                    </strong>
                    motivates people to make a change. We decided that bringing a model of how our everyday actions effect the environment and our own lives would help people really do things different.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arctic takes in telemetry data and generates and arctic environment to represent user driving habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python for data preprocessing of Toyota Connected telemetry car data and Unity3d to generate the augmented reality environment based on the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Everything
                    </strong>
                    . It all seriousness, our biggest issue we had to overcome was learning all new technologies in such a short time span.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to generate data to display nicely on the slider and make beautiful mock simulations of arctic animals using augmented reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Arctic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From here we will continue developing our design skills to improve the environment. We also want to work on the Python data processing to automatically generate graphs and update them in Unity.
