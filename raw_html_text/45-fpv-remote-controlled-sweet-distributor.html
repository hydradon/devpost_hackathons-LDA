                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Want to brighten someone's day but too lazy to leave the comforts of your room? Now you can drop sweets for any stranger from the comforts of your house!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using an intuitive accelerometer based control system coupled with a FPV setup, the user can easily drive the car around, and drop sweets by halting the car. Ultrasonic sensors on board prevent the car from ramming into the wall.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hacked a toy car and wired its motors to an Arduino, which sends signals to control the movement of the car, and prevents it from ramming into a wall by reversing the truck based on input from an ultrasonic sensor. The remote control system was constructed around a radio transmitter and receiver, with the first Arduino connected to the truck fitted with a receiver. A second Arduino, which reads the input from the accelerometer which then interprets and transmits the signals to the truck.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to setup the remote control system, as well as ensure reliability and accuracy of the truck driving system. An autonomous system was explored, but it was difficult due to problems interfacing with the ultrasonic sensor and driving system.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are able to control the car using an intuitive  controlling system, and couple it with an FPV setup.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt to use radio transmitters and ultrasonic sensors with an arduino, as well as how to not be too ambitious.
