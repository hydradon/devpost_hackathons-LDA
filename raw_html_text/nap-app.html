                    College is a challenging and exhausting time for students. Many students do not have time to get enough sleep at night. A short 20-30 minute nap can help to improve one&rsquo;s mood, alertness, and performance. Students need a good place on campus to take a short nap so they can perform to the best of their abilities for the remainder of their day. Nap app provides users with the ability to upload and view the best nap spots in a given area. Each nap spot has a profile with a description of the spot, a picture, and reviews from a long lineage of fellow nappers.
