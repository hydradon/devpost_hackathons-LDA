                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever tried reading a ebook and never got past the first few pages or chapters?
Ever wanted to finish that critically acclaimed novel that everyone seems to be talking about, but would get distracted and drift away after reading in a few minutes?
If yes, then check out FastReader!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FastReader is an eBook reader that uses a reading process based on a research that is proven to increase your focus and attention span while reading a text. And it helps in increasing your reading spead gradually as you read.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using Java in Android studio ( yeah Java, because my Kotlin game isn't strong yet).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging thing was to refresh the textView at the specific frequency based on the user's current reading speed in words per minute. Also it was challenging to think of a way to save reading progress of the user in a particular book, so the user can continue from where he left reading and start from right there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am proud that I was able to implement the basic features like read speed control and was able to implement the minimalist intuitive UI that I imagined, with dark and light reading mode. I also learned parsing epub files and got to know how its contents are stored.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to store state of the app that included storing Java objects instead of just basic data types, to implement the resume reading functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ReadFaster
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a better parser for epub. And figuring a better and more efficient way to navigate and jump between chapters of the ebook.
