                        Many people
                    </strong>
                    around the world do not have money or access to a calculator, especially for testing.

                <p>
                    Our app allows for students to use a mobile calculator and it notifies the teacher that the home/power button has been pressed. This will also

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used
                    <strong>
                        Android Studio and online resources
                    </strong>
                    to help build and solve problems that we faced.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost all the time, our app kept crashing because of NullPointerExceptions, so we had to debug it many times in order to solve it. Because of the many NullPointers, we were being held back, but we got to where we wanted to.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to build the whole calculator and get to learn about how to incorporate UI in android-studio.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how android-studio works and how to connect different java files through one app using the Intent class. Also, we learned that android-studio is picky and that we need to do many things in our code for performing certain tasks.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we will incorporate the part where we notify the teacher about when a student presses any of the buttons and exits the app. Also, we are thinking about making the app such that teachers can make the test through the app and students can take tests with just one device,

                <p>
                    In the GitHub, there are 4 android-studio projects, and our project is called SeCalc. The other ones are irrelevant to this and the final project is in SeCalc
