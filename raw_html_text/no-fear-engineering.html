                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is made entirely of engineers, so it's especially important to us to see other young girls get involved in engineering.  As a minority in our fields, we would love to see more representation for women in STEM, and getting girls involved from a young age is exceedingly important to make sure they stay interested in STEM careers, despite societal pressure to choose something different.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website provides information about each discipline of engineering, as well as providing information about a famous female engineer in that field.  The site is also designed to incorporate a flash game, where users move around a home, exploring how different types of engineering are used in different places in the home.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the website using html and css code, and designed a 3-Dimensional model of a home for the flash game using Google SketchUp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the members of our group knew how to use Flash/Adobe Animate, so our original goal of making animated game based on different types of engineering wasn't attainable for this period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our first hackathon for all of us, so the fact that we were able to complete a project was really exciting for us.  In addition, none of us had any experience with html or css, so what we were able to learn about web design in such a short amount of time was also a great sense of pride for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a few hiccups along the way with losing group members and realizing we didn't have the skill set and time for our original concept, so we had to learn to adapt because of the short time frame of the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for No Fear Engineering
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our next goal is to integrate the flash games for each type of engineering to make this site more usable and interactive for users.  We would love for this project to be able to have an impact on young girls to help more of them join STEM fields and create a more diverse workplace in the future.
