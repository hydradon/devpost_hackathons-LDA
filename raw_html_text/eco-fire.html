                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team sees a lot of people littering at school, which they reply that the custodians will clean it up, but the trash continues to pile up and ends up vandalizing our school. We want to spread the message that littering is not okay.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a game where you try to pick up regular waste while avoiding radioactive waste.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Codehs and used user input to guide a man, then used timers to create levels and then we used some simple get element commands to check for collisions while using custom properties to make the game interesting
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many syntax and logical errors which were not apparent to the eye and took a lot of effort to find and fix
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to work together exceptionally well without placing blame on one another and end up working together to find and fix errors in our code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to overcome coding challenges in a short period of time and finding another way using quick problem-solving skills which we developed within this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eco-Fire
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to continue developing it to soon spread the message about littering and how we should pick up after ourselves or us as humans should end up facing dire consequences.
