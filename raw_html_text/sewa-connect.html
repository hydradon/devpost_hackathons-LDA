                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by SEWA's mission
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is an app for people to request help, become a SEWA volunteer, and SEWA admins to manage requests.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Firebase as the backend, and support both Android and iOS as native apps
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our main goal was to create a platform where SEWA's volunteers can easily connect. We chose firebase as the backend integration because we understand that NPO's such as sewa do not have the funds to hire a developer to create/manage the platform. By choosing firebase even people with extremely limited coding experience can use it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing two production ready applications on BOTH Android and iOS. We are extremely happy of what we built and learned over this weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group uses mostly amazon webservices so we learned the firebase sdk and integrated it into our apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SEWA Connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If the SEWA organization likes our platform we would most definitely teach them how we integrated firebase and teach them how to manage the application.
