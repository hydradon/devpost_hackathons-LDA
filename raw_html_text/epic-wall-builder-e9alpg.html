                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My inspiration to make this game came from my interest in programming. I wanted to apply my programming skills in a project, to learn while having fun.

                <p>
                    The game "Epic Wall Builder" is just a clicker game. It is incredibly simple and addictive.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the game engine Unity along with c# to make the game.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were many challenges I faced as this was my first app. I had trouble with designing the graphics of the application because working with art is not my strength, it was the programming that I was interested in. Nonetheless, along my journey, I got the chance to sharpen my skills with designing graphics and user interfaces. Another challenge I faced was figuring out how to use c# along with Unity since I was only familiar with Java, but thanks to the Unity community I was able to succeed in finishing my game.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my very first programming project and was therefore the beginning of my path to learning programming. I consider this whole project an accomplishment since it sparked my interest in programming and building applications.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about object oriented programming and making efficient well-structured programs. It was very helpful to work on this project, since I was having fun, while learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Epic Wall Builder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for the game is to make it more visually appealing. This includes having an animated background for the app to make it look a little bit less plain. I also plan on getting the app on IOS devices as well as Android devices as soon as the app starts gaining popularity.
