                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    YTP videos on youtube - new words are created by mashing up word parts of other words
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Translates what you type into spoken word - Spanish and English!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this using game maker, despite the engine's many limitations. I started by making a system that talks one word at a time, then later changed it to speech parts. After i got one word working by saying it one syllable at a time, I did the whole alphabet
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are way too many rules and exceptions for words in the English language. It took hours and hours of minor edits to the way it processes words to get a majority of the words to sound correct. It got to the point where i made a Spanish mode because that language adheres to its own rules better
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the whole thing to work in general
Having enough time to add tool-tips and sound effects
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The english language sucks
Coding in gamemaker is very different than anything else ive ever worked with before
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for YTP Speech Synthesizer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Record mode - have the user record their own voice clips for each sound, and let them make the synthesizer say things with their own voice
                </p>
