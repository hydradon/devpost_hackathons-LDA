                <p>
                    Fundamentally, just as it is necessary to know the alphabet for reading, or multiplication tables for arithmetic, it is also necessary to learn
                    <strong>
                        geography
                    </strong>
                    to know where places are, and also some facts about those places so you can tell why they are different. Geography, History, and Civics are seldom taught in classrooms today, which is a major concern considering the increasing focus on globalization and the world economy.
                    <br>
                    Future leaders who are oblivious of geographical knowledge will have a hard time analyzing world events and making rational decisions, let alone understanding basic physical systems of everyday life, like implications of the solar system on climate, water cycles, ocean currents, etc.
                    <br>
                    There are not many games or internet content that provide fun as well as learning for kids. It would be nice if we have a friend or companion that can talk, play as well as teach our kids.
                    <br>
                    When I heard about Alexa couple of years back, I started watching closely and at sometime I thought this would be game changer, especially for kids, and here you go.... I was right!

                    If kids learn geography, then when they hear a story on the news from across the globe, they will actually have an idea of where Kenya, or at least Africa, is. They will also know that Africa is not a country! And if Ebola breaks out in one African country, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that all of Africa is affected.

                <p>
                    I have developed many alexa skills and published to alexa store. However, developing a skill targeting kids are definitely challenging. It requires lots of focus, analysis, content validation and sometime we need become kids ourselves to understand from their point of view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A huge amount was required to carefully collect stories, pictures that are applicable and relevant to kids.
Many thanks to Amazon and Devpost for providing crash course and guidance for developing skill for kids. This made my life a lot easier; definitely not a rocket launch.
