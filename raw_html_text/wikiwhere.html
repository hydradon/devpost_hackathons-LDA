                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We thought this would be a cool way to visualize all the wikipedia holes that people go down, going from link to link, and were also inspired by the Wikipedia game where you try to get from one article to another in the shortest number of links possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a tool that both can visualize the links that a wikipedia article links to, and the sublinks of those articles, by simply clicking on them. It also uses BFS to find the shortest path between any article and another article.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the frontend completely using D3.js and html, whereas the backend is written mostly in C++. Our backend handles querying a sqlite database for wikipedia articles and their links, whereas the frontend handles processing and visualizing the data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the frontend, it was really tough getting D3's graph libraries to work with our project and learning how to use it properly. On the backend, it was challenging handling the massive amounts of data that we had to obtain from Wikipedia.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think that the functionality of our end product, especially from the visualization standpoint, works really well. For example, when the children of a particular article are loaded, any links that the children have to any node that's preexisting on the screen are also displayed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of firsts for this project. One of us basically learned C++ in an afternoon, and two of us worked with d3 for pretty much our first time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for WikiWhere
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to add link functionality for our product - i.e. double clicking brings you to the actual article on wikipedia. We'd also like to implement a slightly better looking front-page, and allow for more general interactivity and control over the visualization.
