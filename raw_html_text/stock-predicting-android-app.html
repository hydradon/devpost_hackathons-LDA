                    Our idea is to &ldquo;predict stock prices using machine learning techniques&rdquo;. There are so many factors involved in the prediction &ndash; physical factors, rational and irrational behaviour, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.

                    But machine learning stands out as a major game changer in this domain. Machine learning techniques have the potential to unearth patterns and insights we didn&rsquo;t see before, and these can be used to make unerringly accurate predictions.

                    We have used the concept of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) to train  our model to output a binary result (whether the stock will rise or fall) and based on this the user can manipulate the stocks he holds to gain a profit.

                <p>
                    We are going to develop a mobile application that can predict the stock &ldquo;rise and fall&rdquo;  probability for some of the major business giants out there in the market. Along with that we will incorporate the nifty ,sensex and gold price prediction in our application. We will integrate the machine learning capabilities with that of the Android Development to bring out feasibility and ultimate user experience. Inputs will be given to user via real time graphical representations about the future prospects. Here the user can analyse himself or can access the support system provided from the application.
