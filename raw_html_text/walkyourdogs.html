                </h2>
                <p>
                    Match with an awesome person who can walk your dog when you don't have time! Or find a dog to light up your day without taking on too many responsibilities!

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Dogs are adorable and amazing! A puppy could be the best gift in our life. However, dog ownership means commitment and long-term responsibility. What's more, sometimes it can be hard to find time every day to walk your dog. Why not find a motivated helper rather than keep your dog stuck indoors?
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, many dog lovers are waiting for the right time to own a dog. This is a perfect chance to spend time around a loving pup! By helping dog owners walk their dogs, dog lovers can not only have a fun time but also get a taste of what kind of dogs fit them best.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To solve this problem, we developed an Android mobile application. Registered dog owners and dog lovers can choose a time slot and then swipe the users based on their preference.  When a dog owner and a dog lover mutually like each other, they can start a conversation and negotiate details about time and location for dog walking.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Language: JAVA
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tools: Android-Studio, IntelliJ IDEA
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frameworks: Retrofit2, OKhttp, RxJava, Spring-Boot, Mybatis
                </p>
                <p>
                    Database: MySQL
                </p>
                <p>
                    Running environment: Google Cloud Platform
                </p>
                <p>
                    Version Control: Github
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, we defined the product needs, including requirement analysis and UI design. The requirements specified what to implement and the functionality of each component. For UI design, we chose yellow for our color palette to help convey energy and action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our software architecture, we created a front and rear end to organize code and provide modularity. The back-end runs with spring-boot and provides a series of RESTful APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We made use of
                    <a href="https://github.com/quintuslabs/DatingApp" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/quintuslabs/DatingApp
                    </a>
                    as the UI template. Thanks to @quintuslabs, we could build such a lovely application!

We should have communicated with each other and exchanged ideas in a written format more frequently during the hackathon.

                            We can successfully run our code and operate our Andriod app on Emulator! We built the login/register layout, timeslot selection function and user communication layout. Finally, we implemented the swipe to like or dislike function.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The architecture conformed to popular practices in the industry: we separated the front end and the back end, and implemented RESTful API to conduct connections between front ends and the back end; we also succeeded in deploying it on Google Cloud Platform.
                        </p>

                            Awesome teamwork! Everyone's good at something: Betty came up with an awesome proposal -- the lovely idea of building such an application -- and made the app logos and collected resources of pictures, and helped with the documentation; Yuxin built the backend and deployed the Jar on GCP, Muhan built the front end application and Dan implemented the Restful API. We worked very efficiently!
