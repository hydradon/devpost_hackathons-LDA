                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Owning dogs or cats keep us active and give us a way to take care and connect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research has shown that owning a dog can help combat loneliness with senior citizens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking the dog for walks, feeding it, not only keeps one active but gives a sense of purpose and comeradery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, elderly living by themselves often are in doubt whether they are still able to take care of a dog.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our dog collar has a speaker built-in that gives tips and reminders about taking care of the dog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The collar senses whether the dog moves, if it eats, and barks, and where it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the dog's behavior the collar gives suggestions like taking walks, meals, games to play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It connects wirelessly to our cloud platform which stores the dog data and creates suggestions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a mockup out of 3D printed shells, a bluetooth speaker, microphone, connect to a smartphone using bluetooth. In this way we simulate how it feels to get voice suggestions from the collar.

                    Challenges I ran into

                    <li>
                        elderly people we interviewed did not agree with our original idea, to have a panic button and a video camera on the dog. They found that elderly dog owners are able enough to carry a smartphone in case there is a panic.
