                </h2>
                <p>
                    We come from a school that is mainly focused on medicine, so competing in this hackathon we have the chance to expand the coding curriculum in our school.

                    Help Hubs is an organization created to help the homeless community become a part of the whole community. Our goal is to get the homeless off the streets and in a more productive environment. We thrive to try and stop the homeless epidemic that has been created in our city. In order to do this we need your help, get out and start pinning.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using MIT app inventor and created our website through wix.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally were trying to create our own map and location pinning service, but we ran into problems with hosting the location data. We also had problems using MIT app inventor, we couldn't properly transmit the location data from the phone to the computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out alternatives for the map pinning, and being able to actually produce an app that works with the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about the process of actually creating an app and website that work well together. We also learned how hard it is to correctly do it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Successfully implementing our original pinning map idea and being able to communicate it to the website.
