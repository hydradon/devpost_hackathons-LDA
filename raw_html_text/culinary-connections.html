                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our mutual love for food and the many occasions where we have connected with peers and professionals through food. After attending networking events, we realized the few times that we were able to interact with our friends due to competitive aspects of these events. This would be a perfect solution - it would open up the opportunity to meet new friends or reconnect with your old ones - all over a pizza or anything of your choice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To begin the process of scrambling and assigning random groups, the scanner class is utilized to store the text file information into objects. The program uses array lists, in this case, to store the users information into variables assigned as &ldquo;numbers&rdquo; or elements in the list. This user input is then put through a for loop that iterates or repeats based on the number of users scanned and processed by the scanner class. The information passes through a series of for loops that checks user for the amount of group members they desire and whether they have already been assigned into a group. After checking these two parameters, the program pairs the user with another user/users that meets those parameters, fulfilling their inputted request. For those that check the other box, everyone remaining passes through and is grouped together based on the number of users they request. After the program completes its iteration, it ceases, and prints out the groups that were grouped together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built with HTML-5 (version), CSS-3 (version), java (running on eclipse), and a google maps API that analyzes proximity to restaurants, we were able to create a solution to all your company food problems. We constructed this used an Dell Latitude E5470, MacBook Air, and an iPad Pro, typing and programming this website into existence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing the interactive portions of the website was difficult. It was a tricky bit of html, trying to create the contact info form as well as importing the pictures. The main problem we ran into was the question: what was proprietary about our program? Why couldn&rsquo;t google forms or sheets basically do what we&rsquo;re doing? The answer came to us after a cold cup of bubble tea - an algorithm that would randomly assign users into different groups. It was distinct from the google apps and allowed for easier coordination from the companies perspective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we&rsquo;re proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our pseudocode algorithm is simple but effective in pairing together free individuals and assembling groups. Our Java experience was limited, but it gave us a valuable opportunity to apply those skills in a practical setting. It should form the heart of the program that we can continue to expand and improve going in to the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was the first hackathon for some of our group members, so we were able to gain important experience for future events. We learned that we can be better brainstormers, and leave more time to debug difficult issues. Leaving a rough timeline in blocks of 1-2 hours for certain modules of the project is an effective way to keep development moving instead of stuck in the same rut. We are all computer science students, so we hope to tackle more difficult projects for next time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What&rsquo;s next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our company's algorithm will be its main point of monetization. If we can use an adaptive or learning algorithm, it will be infinitely more valuable, especially in larger organizations where the number of matches will become overwhelming to sift through. Depending on the success of our original model, we may branch out into hobbies and activities in the local area. This may include bowling, karaoke, arcades, etc.
