                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever we travel, we're always looking at new adventures to have. Traveling is about experiencing the places- seeing the full beauty that they encompass. Instapedia allows you to see what amazing things each place has to offer and choose your vacation for the adventure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Explore the world from the perspective of other travelers, not travel agencies.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pulls top Instagram posts and location for given tags. Click on an image to find out where it is, the best way to get there and hotels to stay in (from Expedia), a wikipedia description to find out what it's really like, and the best things to do once you're there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    NodeJS, Bootstrap, JQuery, Instagram API, Expedia API, and Wikipedia API
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not all instagram photos are geotagged and of those that are, not all of them have good locations. We have to correctly parse the locations to get the right wikipedia article and the closest, most accessible airport for you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can search for any tag and any instagram photo in the world- you can literally find the most beautiful and amazing places in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instagram's API is actually kind of difficult to use! We had to be very careful with what we were pulling for the API.
                </p>

                    What's next for Instapedia
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make the app public so we can search through all of instagram and show people the coolest places around the world.
