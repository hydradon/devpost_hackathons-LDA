                    The App combines interactive game with clever guide and useful informations.
Imagine, you are walking the streets of Munich and passing an interesting building, statue etc.. With "Pretzel Hunt" installed on your mobile phone, it only takes a few moments to get the important facts and some bonus points - the pretzel points! Pretzel points are given, each time you pass a sight and scan its QR code. You also can take a walk and follow a given route including more stops. For taking the public transport, riding a bike or just walking, you can earn even more pretzel points. In the future you can redeem your pretzel points for cool rewards from the partners of City of Munich.
