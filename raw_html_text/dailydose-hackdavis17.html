                    Welcome to Daily Dose -- the web app where all your goals come together to improve your well-being!
                </p>
                <p>
                    By adding a few enjoyable, interesting, and even strange tasks to each day, you can find yourself discovering more and more about the world around you while also finding new ways to exercise and eat healthily!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users are provided with a personal home page displaying all personal goals. They have the option of adding new goals using the New Goal feature, which records goals in localStorage. These goals are displayed along with checkboxes on the home page for the user to check off when complete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users also have the option of writing motivational quotes and blurbs using the Motivational Quote feature. These quotes are stored via localStorage and, when the user checks a goal off their home page, a random motivational quote from the past appears as inspiration moving forward!

                    MOVING FORWARD
I would like to implement a feature in which selected days of the week are displayed alongside the goals on the home page.
