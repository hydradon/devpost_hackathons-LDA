                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create an app, or website that applied to a principal I believe in.
People sometimes only need to here select choice words from one person to have their entire world brightened.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website has a very simple purpose. It simply relays a quote to a user. The purpose of it is to develop into an environment where healthy stress habits can be addressed, as well as promoting wellness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this website by creating a scroller that operates within it's own container. The Website supports an implementation of smooth scrolling, and locks it's supporting features within it's individual section tags.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When programming, and dealing with the overflow of the scroll function, I initially ran into difficulty with the scroll bar near the top, and with other elements such as the nav bar color detection as the original window that relayed scroll  position was removed. To solve this I applied a new version that operated on the set boundaries I created in order to create a parallax effect with a set background. This brought its own issues as well as the backgrounds operating in conjunction with the other code saw bugs arise in indexing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoyed being able to turn various scraps picked up with web development to begin a project of the sort, and the success in building in a manner  that will let me expand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned information regarding boundaries, and managing layers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for A Peaceful Message
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My next focus will focus on API implementation to integrate a larger supply of quotes. As well as implementing whisper functions.
