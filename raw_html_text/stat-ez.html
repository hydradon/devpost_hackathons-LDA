                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students with F-1 visa who apply to the Optional Practical Training (OPT)  . The opt program allow students to get work authorization from US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for internships / jobs.
Problem - Even after one has braved the inane paperworks and countless trips to advisors / international student offices, one would still have to wait up to 90 days for the authorization approval. What makes this wait worse is the lack of updates during the wait. There&rsquo;s also a possibility of rejection. USCIS does a really bad job of keeping one updated on the progress of a case and in general how far along they are going with the entire year&rsquo;s batch of students.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized a web scraper written in python to scrape the USCIS case status page for data on all applicants for OPT. We used a python library called pandas to

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Coding the web scraper proved to be difficult as we ran into a ton of errors that took a tedious amount of time to debug.
