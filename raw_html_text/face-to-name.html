                    I wanted to learn iOS development and AWS (Amazon Web Services) skills so I decided to make an iPhone app that incorporates Swift programming and AWS's APIs. It gets its awesome facial recognition from the AWS Rekognition API.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning iOS Development. It was daunting at first and I was constantly making mistakes that I didn&rsquo;t know how to fix, but I kept with it and kept going back and forth between working on the project and studying Swift&rsquo;s online documentation. Gradually I pieced together the elegant and powerful architecture that makes up Swift for iOS. Then my speed increased drastically from there. However, the learning curve still took a large portion of my time. I&rsquo;d say that if I divided up all the hours I worked on this in half, the first half of the time would only make up for about 20% of the final project because of all the time I spent learning and making mistakes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was about to produce a fully functional, end-to-end iOS app. The app is designed from 100% scratch and took about 2 full weeks of hard work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that, by really putting my mind to it, I can go from no experience to extremely comfortable in a new area of development like iOS dev in a matter of weeks. It&rsquo;s amazing looking back at the beginning of the project and having little idea of why the problems I ran into were happening (I had a lot of mistakes at first!), but now I understand what&rsquo;s going on and what to do. Now I know how to utilize powerful tools such as closures and extensions.
