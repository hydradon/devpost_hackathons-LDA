                    Ranking System &ndash; Customer Problem Statement
I&rsquo;m a staff person at an immigrant worker center and I want to effectively dispatch work to workers in the collective according to their internal system of justice. I&rsquo;m trying to reflect real-time updates and considerations made for ranking workers according to their participation in member activities. But this process is complicated and labor intensive because there are multiple considerations and updates happening all the time, everywhere which makes me feel stressed and overwhelmed.
