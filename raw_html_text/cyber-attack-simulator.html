                    Inspiration: The reason why cyber bullying happens is because predators don't really recognize the suffering of their victims. Most cyber bullies harm others for fun or to pass the time. Some cyber bullies don't even realize that they are bullying someone else on the net. Sometimes, a person needs to  be in a similar situation or feel a taste of the victim's life to really understand. My inspiration was to create an immersive, controlled experience with cyber bullying training so as to better help educate the youth about cyber bullying as well as get experience on how to react to it and identify it. The best way for a person to really understand anything is to experience it first hand.

                    What it does: My project is a unity application which helps educate the youth about the damaging effects of cyber attacks. It starts off with you trying to help a boy get back on his feet after a cyber attack. This initial part helps students understand the affects of cyber bullying on others.

                <h2>
                    How I built it: I made the whole application from C# through the unity game engine.

                    Challenges I ran into: I had lost half of my hackathon time before I actually started to work on it. My initial plan was to make it an immersive experience by including the oculus rift VR headset however, I ran into technical difficulties as my hardware was incompatible with the device. I ended up working on the application throughout the whole night to try and make up for my loss of time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of: I was able to attend a hackathon and submit an actual application this time and I was also able to learn quite a bit about the amazon alexa api.

                <h2>
                    What I learned: Hackathons are never meant to be done by yourself and also broaden my mind to more ideas

                <h2>
                    What's next for Cyber attack simulator: I plan to fix up the bugs with my application and also add more content where the player will be able to get a small experience of what it is like to be cyber bullied and add more questions so that users will be able to really grasp the difficulties of cyber bullying
