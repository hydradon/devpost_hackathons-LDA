                <h2>
                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever since the beginning of Brexit, there has been flows of countless news and information online. With all the articles from press conferences and news, we were the last person who gets the information through the articles. We also had the issue of handling with the fake news and information. 
Under these circumstances, we thought that it'd be wonderful if we could get the information and hear the news directly from the source, the party interested. We created Face Finder in order to get the direct access to the information that we are interested in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It can take a live stream and broadcasted videos, recognise faces of key people such as politicians and then will notify users who are following them about their appearance. The users can watch the videos from the links with the specified time that the people they're following appeared on screen. They can set whom to follow, of course. They are provided with detailed information of the people, including the history of appearance and the basic background information of who they are. The videos are listed chronologically so they can get access to the latest information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our backend services based on python and flask.
Web interface and frontend were worked on vuetify, vue, nuxt, and node.js.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to get gstreamer to work so we can't show the user a live preview of the live stream.
Plus, frontend... :(
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For many of us, it was the first time coding with the tools we used for this project. For me, I've never known that vuetify  and nuxt existed before I started working on the project. We were learning as we were coding. We searched a lot to find better solutions, watched tutorials, and tried out many different algorithms. Though it was very difficult and challenging, we learned a lot from this hackathon experience. We are very proud of ourselves that we accomplished our goals with completely new tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that we can create things out of new and unfamiliar tools. As long as we have the vision, we could find the way to achieve it. We also learned how to cooperate as a team in the process of accomplishing our goal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Face Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For future implementation, we could have notification so that users can get notifications whenever the person the user is following appears on screen. This way, users won't be missing any speeches of the person s/he is following.
