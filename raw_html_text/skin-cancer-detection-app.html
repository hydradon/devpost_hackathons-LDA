                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was interested in getting into machine learning, though it sounded intimidating.  When I learned IBM Satson had visual identification tools, I thought skin cancer detection would be a useful application.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A user opens their phone to a camera, takes a photo of skin they are concerned about and receive a 0 to 1 score if their skin condition is malignant or benign.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using IBM Visual Identification tools on IBM cloud, which helped me deploy it to a Swift app for easy application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to integrate IBM Assistant to create a chatbot that could receive the photos and give back the score.  However, this was purely to make my project more complex.  It was difficult and I spent a lot of time trying to integrate multiple IBM tools.  It was a challenge letting go of that idea, as I realized that it was simpler for UX to leave it as it is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I never worked with iOS Swift, Machine Learning, or IBM Watson.  I really went out of my comfort zone to learn new technologies!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Skin Cancer Detection App
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to upload more and more photos to make the app as accurate as possible.  Perhaps, if I could get the chatbox integration to work simply and quickly, I would consider adding that feature again.
