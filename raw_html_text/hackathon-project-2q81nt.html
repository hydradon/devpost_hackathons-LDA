                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a team we discussed some of the problems facing immigrants and refugees and then set about trying to solve some of those problems. We decided that rather than trying to solve all problems facing them, we would use our limited time to find ways to helps solve some of the problems so we would be able to provide a higher caliber final project.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ImmInfo helps provide immigrants and refugees with quick, easy access to answers to some of their questions regarding how things may be different in the US. We seek to help them overcome the language barrier, both in professional and friendly settings, as well as learn more about certain systems and processes within the United States, and give them information of where people of similar descent or from similar backgrounds are living so they may find a community of people who they can easily relate too when first starting out.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to personalize a template we found online. We then used 000webhost.com in order to host the site so we could manipulate it further and see changes in real time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge we ran into was trying to host the site. None of us had ever successfully hosted a website before, and we were seeking to do it with the smallest financial commitment possible. After several hours, we finally had a breakthrough at about 4am Saturday morning.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall we are very proud of how the site turned out, as well as being proud that we were able to find a way to host a website.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more intricacies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as how to host a hand coded website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for ImmInfo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going forward, we are currently unsure of what will be happening to ImmInfo as we are all freshmen and sophomores in college and have limited free time to continue developing and supporting a website such as this. Hopefully we will either be able to find time to continue ourselves, or we will be able to find an organization and volunteer our website and managing for them to use.
