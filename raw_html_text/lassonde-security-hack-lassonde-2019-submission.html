                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Took on the Transcore challenge.

                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Stores users Mac Address, checks for VPN's and enables two-factor authentication (using text) for utmost security for the Transcore's software licence.

                    <li>
                        We used Python and custom modules to be able to check the Mac Address.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We utilized a VPN checker API.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also utilized the Twillo API given by the Lassonde team to enable two factor authentication.

                    <li>
                        We were having difficulty using Flask to put the back-end development on a web-page. We overcame this by creating a prototype website and the back-end separately.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also had errors with some API's and not working fully.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We had to do intensive research to learn new methods to making the program better.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Created a JSON Database for storing account information.

                    <li>
                        Put an idea into place that solves the issue efficiently.

                    <li>
                        We learned Javascript in the seminar.

                    <li>
                        We were able to self-learn Flask for web development.

                    <li>
                        We learned how to use some newer API's and custom modules.
