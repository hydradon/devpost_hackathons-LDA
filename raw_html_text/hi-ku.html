                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students ourselves, we noticed that students were struggling to develop linguistic structures such as poems and we wanted to help out in the process.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web app bot takes in a haiku and determines if the haiku is valid. Our application provides personalized feedback on improving the haiku to fit in the requirements. It works using the Google Speech Recognition API, allowing the user to speak and respond to the bot like any other human being. It also has the option of messaging the bot the haiku. Our bot also has additional features such as translation and definition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Slack API as a platform to create the bot. We used python code to parse through the input, determine the inputs validity, and return suggestions. We also used the Google Speech Recognition API and other natural language processing libraries in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had the problem of initializing the bot and determining suggestions we could provide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to implement the bot and speech recognition features within the limited time of this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to access API's and integrate them with bots.
                </p>

                    What's next for Hi-ku!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on expanding Hi-ku! for other linguistic submissions such as sonnets and allow the determination of rhymes.
