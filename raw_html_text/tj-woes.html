                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As kids going to a science and tech school interested in finance, focusing on the Capital One challenge was the perfect opportunity to explore the border between two things we love: finance and computer science.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on using customer data to see where they spend most of their money. Based on this we recommend which companies Capitol One should partner with to reap the most benefits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used random customer data as a demo and through frequency analysis we can determine which company Capitol One would benefit the most from.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before using randomly generated data we were using HTTP pull and post requests, but after running into an issue that the Capital One team could not figure out, we created randomly generated financial information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating something because coming into this event we were so lost.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a great deal working to make Capital Connections a reality. One of the most important things we learned was communicating what each team member is working on at all times.
                </p>

                    What's next for Capital Connections

                <p>
                    Making the user interface more friendly.
