                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing the challenge of social reform and hitting the large audience
Rebuilding the broken bridge of humanity among humans
Providing the large platform to help both, those who all are in need and all who want to contribute 
Easy and effective way of helping others
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes people want to donate stuff but they cant find the right person to donate so they end up throwing stuff
So from our application donors can see the NGOs that are in need of the materials by which donors donate their materials to NGOs
So its good to give materials to the needy ones rather than throwing it away because things that are waste for one could be necessity of others
Our application works with the policy that one man&rsquo;s trash is the next man&rsquo;s treasure
