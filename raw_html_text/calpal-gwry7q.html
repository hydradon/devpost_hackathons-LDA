                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bringing convenience to everyday people who are self conscious by allowing users to track calories by taking a picture of your meal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User takes a picture of their food/meal, takes it through the Visual Recognition from IBM's Watson API to analyze what is seen in the picture, and then using the Nutritionix API we can see how much calories is in the food/meal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android development, machine learning, IBM's Watson API, and Nutritionix API to combine everything to create this mobile app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into lots of challenges such as getting POST requests for the IBM's API as well as getting used to Android since it is relatively new to both of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the APIs to work and incorporate it together was a huge achievement to us, introduction into machine learning, and all while learning and developing in Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about time management, teamwork, and communications for soft skills. As for technical skills, we developed a strong foundation in Android and working with various APIs.
