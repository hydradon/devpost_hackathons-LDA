                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like laughing and making others laugh. When presented with the challenge to build a life hack skill, I wanted to tap into this part of my creativity. I realized that many life hacks can be broken into two parts - the setup/problem and the solution. This is when the wheels got turning and I realized it wouldn't be hard to randomly generate bad or joke life hacks by using parts from real life hacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill will randomly generate a life hack that is almost guaranteed not to be useful, but many times will get a good laugh. I have a list of about 40 life hacks that are actually useful and the skill will randomly select two of them and use the beginning of one and the ending of the other to produce a bad life hack.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a pretty simple project. The most challenging part of it was gathering a list of life hacks. The reason this was challenging is because all of the life hacks had to work grammatically no matter which combination was selected. The formula I followed was referring to a specific object in the first half of the life hack, and in the second half referring back to that same object as "it". This allowed for some hilarious combinations that always made sense grammatically.
