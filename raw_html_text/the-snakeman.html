                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a virtual character that could be used as a sort of puppet. The snakeman started out as a simple lizard skin mask effect but evolved into something more complex as I learned more about SparkAR.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Snakeman's facial movements are controlled by your face. He always looks at the camera and writhes about in snakey fashion.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I created a custom blend shape target to make the facemesh look more like a snake man. I built and rigged the neck in Maya and added the eyes and fangs. To create the texture I built a custom effect stack in Photoshop and drew scales to fit the face using the facemesh UV map as reference. I used the facetracker as the root of the skeleton to keep the face centered as the main focus of the effect. I used the patch editor to combine two types of motion for the neck, one to rotate the joints opposite to the facetracker which keeps the neck on-screen, and a second sine wave motion to give the neck some wiggly character. Finally I carefully lit the scene and added a colored rim light to accent the effect.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It took me a while to figure out why tiling the neck texture wasn't working properly. It turned out that it had to be a power of 2 texture. It also took a fair bit of experimentation to find a setup where the neck would stay on screen when the user's head was rotating. I tried a lot of variations on textures and I wasn't able to get satisfactory results with normal maps. In the end I just used some specularity to give a more subtle effect. I was originally using eye tracking but then I realized it wasn't supported on Instagram so I cheated by making the eyes rotate opposite to the facetracker to get them to look at the camera.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm quite happy with the way it turned out. For one of my first SparkAR projects it has been very well received. It really feels good when I see videos recorded with it where people are getting into character.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about the pipeline from Maya into SparkAR. There is a very specific format you need to use to transfer blendshapes correctly. The patch editor is powerful but there are still many things it can't quite do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for The Snakeman
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to try a similar effect where I create an entirely custom model and drive blendshapes using the facetracker output.
