                    #inspiration    We were always struggling with the long waiting times in the Mensa of THI and we saw the pain that the workers are facing and the time wasted during this process so we thought of improving the situation by helping both students and workers having better time, our companion takes an order from the User (student) and give him all the information needed about the menu and then submit it to the Mensa so you can find your meal prepared in the right time without loosing any minute. For now it is just a Prototype so we tried to make it as easy and smooth as possible using Dialogflow . Some of the challenges we ran into The assistant isn't prepared for some advanced commands,
and some of the things that we're proud of we made something really good in a short amount of time using little ressources but not only that, we also learned especially how to work in teams and programming skills also, our plan for the Mensa Companion to implement in first stage in all universities of Germany and the world and in a final stage in all the restaurants.
