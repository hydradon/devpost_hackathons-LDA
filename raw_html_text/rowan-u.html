                <p>
                    Originally I had trouble creating the GUI for the Echo Show and Alexa apps. However, once I found the ASK SDK it made the process much easier. I was able to just pass the title and image to the sdk and it generates the layout for me.

                <p>
                    I'm proud that I developed an application that provides easy to access information about Rowan. The school has a number of apps all of which provide information about the school. Between ordering food, checking my grades, and finding events, I have at least 5 "rowan apps" on my phone. This Alexa skill allows me to access of the information in one place.

                    I plan on expanding my Alexa skill to other universities. This could be useful to all college students, no matter which school you go to. Many schools also use CampusLabs for planning events, so it would be easy to support other universities.
