                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After attending many hack-a-thons we found that it was hard to keep in touch with the people we met.. further.. we couldn't even meet many due to being so busy all the time (think 36 hours no sleep)... So..  HackTag was born...

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a multi-platform application (existing in webapp, android app, and pebble watchapp forms) for instantly networking with other hackers in your immediate area!  After signing up and performing a few configurations you can instantly network with those around via the power of BLUETOOTH (note: some assembly required... i.e. still in development).

                    <li>
                        Orlando Bloom - Node.js Master
                    </li>

                <p>
                    Each of us focused on an individual task as indicated above and spent 24+ (rounding up) hours (half) developing a (mostly) complete series of applications!  It has a few... missing components but is well on its way to becoming a masterpiece!  (And is perfectly demo-able. ;) )
