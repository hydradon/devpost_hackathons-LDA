                    Whenever you drive to a new city you're tasked with having to find a parking spot. Short of tracking every single parking spots to share which are available, you can share the areas where you could find spots that fit your needs. Without this information, one would may up and down each street only to find that you aren't allowed to park on any of them. With our new tool, you can see where spots are located. The intention of this product is to drastically cut down the amount of time spent looking for a spot as well as the number of cars on the road looking for parking. Doing so would not only give the benefit of time conservation, it would also decrease traffic, often caused by having a large number of cars on the road, wandering around aimlessly for the ideal spot. With this application, the problems would be reduced.
