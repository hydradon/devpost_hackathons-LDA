                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As someone who speaks english as second language, we want to provide people with the ease of communication with their physician.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a service that helps patient to find someone who speaks their native language who can help translate important information from their physician.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the front-end using react react-bootstrap css and developed the back-end using node.js express.js mongoDB and javascript

                <p>
                    Setting up the environment for both back-end server and client side, and figuring out how to collaborate on github as a team
