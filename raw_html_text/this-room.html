                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was initially inspired while I was on a hike. It struck me that there were only a few accessibility skills for the Echo, and I thought an audio skill would be wonderful for someone who is visually impaired. There is also a YouTube channel called "The Blind Experience", and I was watching that at the time, so it inspired me to want to make something to help people who are visually impaired. I also thought it would be neat to have something that could display information about different rooms for such applications as real estates or rental units.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This Room allows Alexa to present attributes about any room. This Room allows multiple rooms to be added, and each unique room is identified using a different Echo device including Echo Dots. This Room could be used for many applications including helping the visually impaired, giving instructions to house guests, room presentations, classrooms, offices, directions, and much more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The room attributes are set-up on the website ActualCalorie.com, and each device will have a device number that is easily found in a drop drown menu, so you can differentiate between devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have added a locator option, and I also added a location attribute option on the room set-up form.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of this is built using Php. I'm running it through a Lamba then to my endpoint. I simply grab the device Ids, that way I know when there is a unique room. The website is simply using a database to interact with the Echo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was actually a simple project, but I did run into some problems at first with getting the device Id. I believe initially that option wasn't available, so I had to wait until they implemented the ability to grab the Id before I could proceed with my idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud this skill might actually help someone someday. This skill was initially aimed at helping the visually impaired, so I hope one day that will become a reality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Always take your time when writing code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for This Room
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to further the options for the visually impaired, but I need feedback on what to actually create in that regards. I also want to add games that can interact between rooms.
