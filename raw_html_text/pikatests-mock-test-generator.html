                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every year we hear our classmates hassling our professors to find out what is going to be on the next test. Even after receiving study guides, they still ask older friends and T.A.'s for previous versions of the exam to better prepare themselves. In order to facilitate sharing this knowledge we wanted to make a site where this information could be easily shared and students would no longer be frustrated by studying irrelevant information for their exams.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users submit previous exam questions that are filed under university specific course numbers.

                    Making an efficient yet functional back end.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to launch a functional version of our web-app in 48 hours.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Things will take longer than expected and have more than 1 iteration.

                    What's next for Pikatests: Mock test generator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand to create more personalized tests and course lists based on user profiles. Also we would like to add the functionality of allowing users to submit answers and be able to regulate submitted content with up and down votes. Eventually, based on community demand, we think Pikatests could quickly scale to other universities.
