                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Financial wellness is extremely important, and in a world where automation is king, why not automate financial wellness? In my financial life, I have found two problems. One problem is my inability to save money on a regular and systematic basis. Not being able to save adequately, places a strain on my finances which makes it harder for me to donate to one of my favorite charities. That is why I came up with the idea of Save Socially.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Save Socially rounds up transactions from your checking account and transfers the round up to your savings account. You can then set a percentage of that round up, between 1% and 100%, to be donated to the charity of your choosing from ProPublica's list of 1.9M non-profits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We exclusively used FFDC API's to build out this applications. We use the Accounts API to grab Checking and Savings account. We use the Transactions API to grab checking account transactions. We use the Internal Transfers API to transfer money from the Checking to Savings account
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially ran into issues with accessing FFDC, but we got the proper support to get the API's working correctly! Time was also a challenge as we were unable to full complete our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to get a lot of the functionality working for an MVP. The only piece that is left is creating a Bill Pay to cut a check the charity of the users choice
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use FFDC which is really neat. As a Native Android developer, I was able to learn a lot of React!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Save Socially
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for Save Socially is to integrate FFDC's Bill Pay API, so that we can send checks to the charity of the users choice. We will also need to code a proper watcher to more accurately calculate round ups.
