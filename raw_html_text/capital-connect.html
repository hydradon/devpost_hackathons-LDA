                    Capital Connect is a unique way to allow Capital One customers to invest their accumulated rewards points in a promising startup in hopes of their success. By doing so, the investor becomes a shareholder in their startup company of choice, backed by Capital One's own business experts and analysts. The platform makes it easy to authenticate through Capital One's API, and authorize the transaction. The platform also provides a reputation meter whose value is determined by the expert analysis of Capital One's own professionals.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to create the app. We used Dreamweaver to create the website.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On multiple occasions, we ran into technical problems that seemed to arise out of nowhere. For example, Android Studio would through errors that were exceptionally difficult to find, and the files for our website were corrupted twice.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work effectively as a team to overcome our own challenges.

                    What's next for Capital Connect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to fully integrate Capital One's payment and authentication API into the app to give the user a complete feeling of security.
