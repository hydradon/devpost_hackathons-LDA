                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    About 30-40% of our food supply is wasted, and 1 in 5 people go to sleep on an empty stomach. We seek to bridge this gap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows restaurants to notify food banks when they have a surplus of food that they would like to donate, instead of throwing away.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built an online database that would gather this information, and be updated through the Android app. The app sends notifications to registered local food banks to facilitate pick up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Prototyping the idea, and integrating API's like Postmates to automate delivery/pickup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to develop a viable product.
                </p>

                    What's next for Foodings
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Launching this into the real world, and coming up with a webapp for non-Android users.
