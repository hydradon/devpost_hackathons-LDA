                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The pollution on our planet is increasing yearly across the world. Although policies for CO2 emission reductions are being discussed and implemented, our planet is still facing consequences due to short-sighted mass human environmental destruction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once you click on a link attached to a specific country, you are given the option to input a year value. This year value is then processed by an algorithm that was generated with a dataset provided by the World Bank Open Data. The output variable is the number of CO2 emissions per capita in that country.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was built with JavaScript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we are completely new with coding, we ran into very many problems. We were unaware of how to commence our project, therefore, with the use of mentors, we were about to learn how to code with JavaScript. A few of our problems include: generalizing and formatting code, learning to use a program never used before, implementing an algorithm within the code for each country, inputting buttons for each country and placing them in the correct position on the map, usage of different colours, fonts, and text size, etc.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are new to coding and only have had minimal experience with it. Celeste is currently in an Introduction to Computer Programming course, whereas Chloe has never coded before in her life.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a new form of coding with JavaScript.

                    What's next for Interactive Map and CO2 Emissions
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to input more algorithms associated with every country in the world. We will also input a current population status within the popup of each country.
