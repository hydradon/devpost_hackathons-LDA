                    It provides the inexperienced investor with the sentiment data of experts in the field, which can help them make better investment choices. It also provides the experienced investor a look into the mind of the average investor. While both of these events are occurring, we are collecting large amounts of data, which we can sell when we get a large enough data set down the line.

                <p>
                    "The devil is in the details". We had a theoretical application written out on the whiteboard, but the hardships come when you try to implement them with code.
