                    Problem
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When orders of protection are granted by the court the sheriff's office only goes out to serve them once between 9-5 when the recipient (i.e. abuser) is in their geographic jurisdiction. This results in orders of protection not being served and therefore not being enforceable. That results in the domestic violence and/or stalking victim having to take more time off work and get childcare in order to continue going to court to continue the order - causing more harm to someone who is already a victim.
                </p>

                    Solution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Get orders of protection serve by people more dedicated to the process than the sheriff's office is.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    In IL the sheriff's office, a licensed detective agency, or anyone over 18 who is appointed by the court can serve process. This allows the usage of volunteers but does require that the lawyer bringing the order of protection request before the court to know the name of the volunteer before they go into court.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Implementation Concept
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allow lawyers to request a volunteer process server before going into court. Allow volunteers to accept or reject the request for a volunteer process server and get their name to the lawyer if they accept. The lawyer informs whether the order was granted or not and if granted gets the volunteers address to mail them the original order so they can serve it. The volunteer serves the order, signs the affidavit of delivery and updates the ticket and informs the lawyer. The domestic abuse survivor is protected by law and does not have to continue going to court related to the order of protection for a longer period of time.

                    Technical Details
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After exploring many options including a Red Cross's volunteer dispatching system and Zapier, we moved to integrating the Freshdesk API and PagerDuty API and a volunteer sign-up form within a Python Flask app.
