                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all fear something; whether it&rsquo;s spiders, public speaking, heights, or anything else. This fear creates anxiety that can take over many people&rsquo;s lives, but we wanted to prevent this which is exactly why we created Mentech,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The VR simulation puts you in a situation that you fear while the web app asks you questions about what you&rsquo;re experiencing through which we can determine your anxiety level. After each of these simulations, you will also be able to view your progress in overcoming your fear through the easy-to-use web app and gain access to resources that will help you seek further help to treat this anxiety.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity to create the Virtual Reality Simulation which operates using the Oculus Rift. For the web app we utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase (for log-in and log-out), Linode (for web hosting), and we also used the Google Cloud Platform (for speech to text API and sentiment analysis).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately we found out at 2 am on Friday night that the two people who were going to be part of our team, who were the VR and Oculus Rift experts, were unable to participate in Hack the North. Thus, we had to change our entire idea as well as learn so many new concepts as it was only the two of us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to learn so many new things in just a span of 36 hours!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most important lesson we learned was that you have to always have to confront challenges head-on. After we found out that we were short two people, we didn't panic and instead we were able to pivot our idea and learn new coding skills which enabled us to have such a wonderful experience at Hack the North.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Mentech
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're planning to hopefully continue Mentech in the future as we believe that there are so many opportunities for Mentech to succeed.
