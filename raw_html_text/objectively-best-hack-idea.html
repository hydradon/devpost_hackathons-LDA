                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are creatively bankrupt and want the machines to do everything, including winning hackathons. We therefore decided to make machine learning work for us at this hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By scraping the winning hacks from previous hackathons and feeding their taglines into Microsoft Azure's Text Analysis API, we retrieved a series of subjects to turn into a buzzword filed description.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Microsoft Azure, Python, node.js and tears.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everything. Literally everything went wrong. Devpost went down, Keras stumped the entirety of the university's computer science department and the tube on the way here was cancelled.

                    Managing to salvage anything from this project.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Computer science is a capricious and fickle goddess.

                <p>
                    Who knows? Maybe actually using Keras, maybe tidying up the code.
