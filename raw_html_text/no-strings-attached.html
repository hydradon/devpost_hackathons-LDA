                    We were sitting on the couch at 2 in the morning playing guitar hero and thought about how awesome it would be to have VR Guitar hero with a powerglove controller.

                <p>
                    We took input from 4 flex sensors into an arduino and sent those values to unity to be used as controller inputs. The games was built in Unity and builds into VR
