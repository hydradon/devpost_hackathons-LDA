                    </em>
                    .
It uses Amazon lex's NLP to be able to understand a victims query to locate the nearest Victim Service Provider on the bases of just a couple of questions which ask the user of his/her age, location, service, gender.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Publishing the application to the AWS Serverless Repository was particularly tricky and I had to consult Keeton(AWS Serverless, Slack) multiple times.
Another challenge was using Facebook test users with Messenger bot as there is no clear way to add the bot to a page created by test user.
