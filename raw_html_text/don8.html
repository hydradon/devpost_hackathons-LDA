                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Donations, contributing to the community. We wanted to give back to the community, but more so make it easy for the general public to give without having to spend much effort doing it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An easy way to donate on a daily basis, small amounts with a big change, without impacting the customer's bank balance to a noticeable degree.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is built using the latest API's available on Fusion Fabric Dot Cloud. We utilize a vast range of technologies such as API's, Machine Learning, Java, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, JQuery, AJAX and more.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were some issues getting one of the FFDC API's to work due to authentication issues, however, with the help of our expert team here in Finastra, we were able to solve the problem quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the short time we had, we were able to produce a fully working, functional and impressive looking application, that was only possible due to good management in the form of Agile working, Scrum and short Sprint deadlines, that utilized good teamwork and dedication.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Don8 team learned a great deal from this experience, for example, the various API's that FFDC has to offer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Don8
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is so much more that can be done to take Don8 to the next level, this is not an application that just ends here, we have so many more ideas that can help the donation/charity industry.

                <h2>
                    About ML
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To attract the user and show them the preferred organization that they may want to make donations to we will use an ML module:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ML module inputs data such as the age of the user and the location, (all static data we take from the user when s/he signs up for our app). The ML algorithm will learn also from new users data and can fit his suggestion to the new users accordingly. The ML module is using a MultiOutputClassifier build on a RandomForestClassifier(all implemented on python with sklearn).
                </p>
