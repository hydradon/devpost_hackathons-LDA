                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is no silver bullet to solve the immigrant problem.  We have organizations that want to help but couldn't reach the immigrants due to lack of technology. On the other side, immigrants who need help but couldn't find right the resources to enable them transitioning into a newly adopted home.  The mPortal act as a centralized place that provides the connections between organizations and immigrants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is a centralized place where non-profit organizations can connect with immigrants based on their needs in real-time, and track the progress of how many immigrants are in the pipeline.
                </p>

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a webapp with node.js, react, MongoDB, and with a lot of love.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    There are technical challenges and business challenges.  We can solve the technical challenges with time and resources but the business challenges are harder to solve.
