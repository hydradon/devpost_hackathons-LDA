                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having co-workers, clients and friends with dementia, the team has witnessed first hand the difficulties of living with a neurodegenerative disorder. We wanted our hack to help improve the daily life of these friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When activated, the system uses the acceleration of the door to detect an adult with dementia leaving the house unattended, and alert their family to the situation. This solution helps manage the situation while letting users maintain their autonomy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the embedded system detects the motion of the house door opening using an IMU and Arduino UNO. It sends the acceleration data of the IMU to the Serial Monitor
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the Python script accesses the acceleration data through and Arduino-python bridge and compares it to training data to classify it as a significant door opening (this is done using our developed pattern recognition algorithm)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the Python script sends caregivers a text message alerting them to the situation using Standard Library. It also sends the older adult a text message linking them to a website that can guide them in case they need assistance
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the website (built using HTML, CSS and JS) shows the user their current location using Google Maps API from Google Cloud Services to gently guide them home, while offering the option to contact EMS and family members through a simple button press
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The details in integrating and designing take time! Testing system for edge cases is crucial to successful deployment.
