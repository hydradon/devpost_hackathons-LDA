                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Image detection is something that is there, but is not really used much. Coincidentally, the disabled don't get much love also. So, I thought it would be time to bring these two neglected aspects of technology and life into perspective.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A blind person launches the app (a web app in this case). While they walk, they can take a snapshot of the world in front of them. The app takes the snapshot and uses Microsoft's Cognitive Services to help decipher the image. Then using speech synthesis, the app reads out what's in front of them. The app can tell if a wall, a person, a chair, steps, and other objects is in their path. It can give them information or alert them of danger.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's built using pure JavaScript. It uses REST API's to call forth the Microsoft machine learning services and uses a built in speech synthesis API for dictation. Google Cloud is used to host the service.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the Cognitive Services API's were a pain as they require a lot of reading and debugging. At some occasions, some services had to be ditched because they simply weren't well documented.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am amazed that I learned REST API's and more about JavaScript. But, I am truly proud to help out the disabled with technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that that something can take a turn for the worst. Despite the challenges, always look into the goal as it is what helps drive you for something worth more than a few headaches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for the app
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With prospect, the app might see an Android/iOS release. If it really takes off, then mobile platforms might integrate them to begin with.
