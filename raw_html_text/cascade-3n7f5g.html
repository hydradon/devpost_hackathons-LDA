                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two years ago, I stumbled upon a Wired article about digital well-being. It linked what was a promising, but barely existing movement at that time: something called Time Well Spent (Now the Center for Humane Technology). It would soon grow to such an extent that it's founder, Tristan Harris, was invited to do a TED talk on it. In this, he raised the fact that push notifications and the psychology of us believing we were missing out on things, being left out of social circles, was directly driving our mobile phone addiction, and spiraling something that could be used for positive things, into an obsession. Companies like Google pivoted to digital well-being last year, but the fact remains that manufacturers of Android lag behind in their own versions of Android.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It classifies and blocks push notifications based off a Bayesian Classifier.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used flutter, dart, and java.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flutter's still relatively new so there's still alot of ground untread in terms of accessing system level apis from flutter, and having two-way communication from both sides.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Literally did not and do not know Android, somehow picked myself out of the system-level api mess.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I know more than I wanna know about accessing and creating streams for system-level APIs.
                </p>

                    What's next for cascade
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scheduling "bad apps"/ "timewasters", and ultimately creating an IFTTT recipe. The goal is to not let apps be unconsciously pushy, and to actually develop it into a full on productivity app on the App Store.
