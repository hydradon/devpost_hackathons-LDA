                    Inspiration: We wanted to spread awareness about the carbon footprint, and wanted to people know how it is affected by simple life choices while allowing them to compare their carbon footprint with people around the world.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: It lets a user fill out a questionnaire, the answers of which are then used to estimate annual carbon dioxide emissions of that person. Then that data is plotted on the world map by taking the user's location as it joins hundreds of entries on our database which can be viewed on the map by anyone.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We built a progressive web app using ReactJS and made a questionnaire in it, and we used MongoDB to host our Database. We also used the GoogleMaps GeoLocation API to plot our users on the map
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into were plentiful, but they was mostly related to MongoDB and setting up our database on it
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Using the GoogleMaps GeoLocation API to plot our users' locations is something we are very proud of, and we were also able to make our progressive web app very responsive
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: we learned a lot about using React, setting up databases, using the GoogleMaps API
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GlobalCarbon: we want to improve it further, perhaps improving UI and adding more features than can better engage the user
