                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One weekend I was sitting and reading Rants from my developer friends, the it struck me why not create an Alexa skill that will read out the same!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can ask it for Rants and it will fetch you one, currently it is based on random (algorithm) and Popularity
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it

                <p>
                    Just a lot of Overflowing and drinking Coffee

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was my first encounter with AWS Lambda functions and I found that challenging at first, but then found out that it is pretty interesting to work on. And it's based on Node, which makes it even better.... And bonus, Amazon provides decent template codes to start with....
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, that was my first time developing something, and I was excited to do the same but at end of the day, I somehow managed to pull that off successfully, I am proud of the project as a whole. And being a student I am able to get time to do stuff like this, i am proud of myself also a little bit... ^_^
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learner AWS Lambda functionality and how to work with Intents and Slots, and thanks to this, I will niw be able to work on Google's dialogflow and other NLP tools to develop voice assistant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for devRant Unofficial
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I plan to add more features like creating Rants and liking and commenting on other Rants... That is another level of challenge for me, but I expect to accomplish that task!
