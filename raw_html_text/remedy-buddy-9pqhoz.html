                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If a college student was sick, and was not in the best condition, wouldn't it be great if there could be a savior or a buddy who could help relieve them from their pains? And even if you were able to get to the nearest pharmaceutical store, you may encounter an overwhelming range of medicine with no idea which one to choose from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those moving away from home for the first time, being sick with no one to receive care from can be extremely taxing. What if there was an application that could address these issues?  It is with this realization that we as a team sought to achieve. Then came the birth of Remedy Buddy.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Remedy Buddy website focuses on allowing users to find the right medication for them based on their symptoms and personal preferences. We hope for this directory to better suit the users need in finding positive and effective medications based off of other user's reviews and ratings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Remedy Buddy app focuses on bringing about rapid medication to those who need it. We've envisioned the users of the app to aid one another in delivering the requested medication to facilitate a healthy environment for students on campus.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We drew out sketches and wireframes. Made prototypes on sketch, and coded it through html, css, and javascript.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many technical challenges that forced us to simplify our ideas. In addition, we constantly thought of integrating more features into our app/website to better facilitate and empower our users, but with the limited amount of times, many of these considerations became unrealistic given aforementioned time constraints and our own technical ability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy to see that a major component of our project is its functionality and its potential to benefit people from its use. Though what we've created contains limited features, it still proved that even without the strongest technical ability or knowledge in programming, we were still determined in implementing something impacting even as a team of designers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate with developers, as we frequently sought help from other groups in the hackathon. We were surprised to see how friendly the community was in the willingness to help each other out despite the time pressure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Remedy Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to collaborate with developers to further bring the site and app live, and also implement other features (gps--live tracking of deliveries, etc) that we wished to incorporate during the hackathon.
