                    Ceres, CA unfortunately does not make as much tax revenue as its neighbors, Modesto and Turlock. This is due to the fact that Modesto and Turlock have more independent businesses and recreation, where as Ceres only has chain businesses and little recreational locations. Many Ceres residents even admit that when they go out, they never spend their time in Ceres.

                    While Ceres has been improving in terms of adding more independent businesses, adding more recreational locations, and reconstructing the town: many of these businesses and sites go unnoticed, unheard of, and receive very little business. This is partly due to 3 reasons: 1) These businesses and sites get no advertising. 2) Many Ceres residents cannot find these sites because they are in remote, small locations. 3) These businesses do not reach out the community.

                    That's where Live and Love Ceres comes in. The purpose of the website is to advertise and attract Ceres residents as well as outer residents to these businesses and locations by highlighting what they are, what they provide, where they can be located, and how they compare to competition. The web site is built to be simple and fast for anyone to use, with no hassle of finding names or addresses. Implementation of this site will hopefully increase tax revenue for Ceres by attracting more people to its businesses and locations.
