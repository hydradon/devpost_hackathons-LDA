                    This project allows baseball fanatics to mingle by having their first date at a baseball game.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used codepad to have our team contribute snippets of code to build our website. We then transferred our code to the WebStorm IDE to publish our website and link the pages together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All members of our team had never experienced a hackathon before and since we had time constraints, it was fairly difficult to stick with an idea and produce a decent project
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make a somewhat functional website!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all gained a bit more insight into making websites using HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
                </p>

                    What's next for HomeRun
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We shall finish our website and turn it into an app
