                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We found that the original idea of making a "pokemon" game would take too long to implement. We found ourselves at the point of being able to do object detection, and decided to make a maze out of it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It automatically generates a random maze and requires to user to solve it. However, solving it is not as easy, since the orientation of the maze constantly changes
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Recursive Division algorithm to generate the maze and matrices to keep tracking of where the play can go, as well as the start and end
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had problem sorting the data of scores

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a maze algorithm and make others "think" when they are solving the maze

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the Recursive Division algorithm 
We learned about object collision through Matrices
