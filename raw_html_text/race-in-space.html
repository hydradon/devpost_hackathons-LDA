                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our group's mutual interest in learning Unity. We also found a great tutorial which helped us a lot. We treated this as more of a learning experience due to our lack of experience and our inability to complete our previous ideas.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a flying game in which you move the ship around the screen to avoid hitting into the mountains.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We followed a tutorial and used our basic knowledge of Unity to create our game. Also we used assets that were provided online.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We only decided on doing this project once we had already tried to get our previous ideas to work which left us with very little time left and very little options when it came to what we can do.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are happy that we actually did learn some new features in unity like terrains. This was one of our groups goals at this hackathon. Unfortunately that about covers our accomplishments because we were unable to do a lot of what we had originally thought of doing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have learnt the difficulties of using VR or AR or any hardware in Unity. It was impossible to figure them out and get them to work in a short time period of 24 hours. We learnt the importance of using what you know and that if we want to use any special hardware like VR or AR then we will need some experience outside of the hackathon to be able to at least get it working. We also learnt how to use terrain in Unity which seems useful and something we plan on learning more about.
