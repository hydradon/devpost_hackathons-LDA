                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    i wanted to make an watch app that not only would activate the normal ring mode of and android phone but also would enable it to broadcast a sound that would help the user be able to find it if the case is that has been lost in vibrate mode or don't remember where it was placed the last time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does it do
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now it just shows the interface between the android phone and the pebble where it tells the user when the pebble phone locator is offline or when tit is online and on the pebble watch we created a pebble app to try to enable the phone from vibrate mode to normal ringing mode
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Me and my teammates built the app on Java for the android to do the interface between the android and the pebble watch  and JavaScript to build the watch app
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really didn't have any knowledge of programming in java or JavaScript either so we had a a pretty tough time
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we were at least able to create the interface between the pebble watch and android phone with out any knowledge of any on the languages
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that teamwork is a great help in these hack-a-thons and we learned a lot in a few hours and we are very grateful
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Pebble Phone Locator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we would like to be able to make our project do what we really wanted from the beginning  and continue improving it with different features
