                    Executive Summary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Farmworkers suffer from dehydration and heat exhaustion. Our project will allow danger detection in real time. &ldquo;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, farmworkers die from heat - related illness at a rate 20 times greater than that of the entire U.S. civilian workforce.&rdquo; (Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs (AFOP)) With our project, we will create a website that collects body temperatures, heart rate, and water intake of the farmworker from a wearable data monitor (tag). OSHA has regulations in place for the farm owner to comply with: the farmworkers water intake, amount of breaks, and shaded area. The website will allow for the farm owners to more easily comply with the OSHA regulations, as well as keep track of  farmworkers&rsquo; health. Furthermore,  the crew leaders will benefit by providing reliable and easy to understand data about the workers. Our project benefits farm workers by ensuring proper care is taken in regards to preventing heat exhaustion and dehydration, while still maintaining anonymity.

                    Design
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ** Main Design **
The website keeps track of tag information such as body temperature, heart rate, water intake and breaks taken by the farmworker. The data provided from the tags will be turned into statistics which will be reported to OSHA to ensure compliance from farm owners  with the  regulations provided. This system will depend on a tag to deliver body temperature as well as water intake and heart rate. Our implementation of the sensor needs to be worn on the body to facilitate the monitoring. In addition, the tag is used to detect when workers taking breaks. The website will make use of the data to inform the farm owners, as well as OSHA and the crew leaders, of current worker conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the Home page, the farm owner or crew leader, is asked for their log-in information. This login will take them to their personal farm statistics and crew leader&rsquo;s page. The statistics page breaks down the information from the tags in a clear and effective way for the farm owner or a member of OSHA to glimpse at and derive proper information on the safety of the farmworkers. The crew leader&rsquo;s page is designed to present information on each tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An important part of our project is the fact that it does not collect GPS information of workers and there is no language or literacy barriers in using the tags. The tags will be user-specific, but rather the data collected will be generalized for the farm. Our system will also have the ability to receive information of how many breaks the workers are taking and sending alerts to the crew leader if someone has not taken a break.  This information will also aid in an early detection system for heat exhaustion, when it detects that a worker&rsquo;s heart rate and body temperature begin to rise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ** Project challenges **
One of the biggest challenges is not being able to test our tag design and collect actual data. There is a lot of factors that could affect our project; These factors could be that the farm owner does not want to implement or follow up with data. Another is the farm owners denial of an  electronic check in to water areas or absolute denial of using this form. A ternary problem is that there is also a responsibility for the farmer and crew leader to ensure that the tag is being worn at all times during the work shift.

                <p>
                    Example 1: A farm worker picks up a tag from the crew lead; as the day goes on the tag reminds the farmworker that he/she needs to drink water. Farmworker proceeds to the water station where the system will detect that they are taking a break. While the farmworker are out in the field,  the tag will monitor its body temperature. If the software detects that the body temperature is reaching abnormal levels, it will send a notification to the tag that will allow the farmworker to know they need take a break and drink water. The software will also notify crew leaders of potential health issues issues with their workers.
