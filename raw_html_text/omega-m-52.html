                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deeply touched by the story of our teammate, Carlos, whose mother love extends to all those dogs that have ran away from home and got lost, and to all those helpless stray dogs who can't find a warm and comfortable place to call home, we decided to create a mobile app solution to solve the problematic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our mobile app unites dog owners and lovers into a community of helpers. It lets owners who have lost their furry partner to make a report so that other members of the community can help to locate them. It also allows people to report dogs that are in need of a home, so that they can find a human friend and create a family.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android SDK and programmed in Java the Android App using the Android Studio Development Software. We connected the app to Firestore's

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the Hack, we were poorly knowledgeable in Java and in Android Development. We, however, managed to learn by experience through tutorials and with the help of the mentors, o that we managed a finished product by the end of the 24 hours. One of our main challenges was the use of asynchronous functions to link our app to the non-relational database but we managed to work around the problem.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We assumed different roles throughout the Hack and we learned how to work as a team.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learn to code in a new language, in a new framework with new technologies.
