                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personal struggles with vocabulary. Also would be useful for international students here at Waterloo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows you to build your own dictionary by saving words that you want to remember/learn. Can also quiz you on your words.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Web design was mostly new to us, so we had to learn all of the basics while we were building this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully built the website, and we were able to implement all of the core features that we wanted.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use different full stack technologies, and we learned to deal with unexpected challenges such as bugs that made our code unresponsive.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for My Dictionary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to incorporate this with other technologies such as Google Home or Alexa. We hope that this project will grow larger so that it can help people improve their language skills and have a positive impact on communities.
