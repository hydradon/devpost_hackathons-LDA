                    How it came about
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking about the contexts in which we could see ourselves using, and could remember having used the skyscanner service. The one that stood out the most was for the impromptu organisation of group adventures.

                <p>
                    Usually by the time people think it's a good enough idea to look for tickets they're:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        too drunk to come to a decision
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        too sober to commit to their flights the next morning
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The adventure button obliges its users to commit with a binding pact and forces the decision of a location whilst leaving it in the hands of the users.

                    You'll get a better idea of this by watching out our

                    It's been padded by about 9 minutes by the video editor, but the guy with final cut is sleeping so enjoy.
