                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't know how to choose a movie very well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We parse a Facebook individual/group conversation and analyze keywords. We then run those keywords through CSG's and OMDB's APIs to obtain possible movies and information about said movies.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front-end is a Chrome Extension that can be run when a Facebook messenger conversation is in the active tab. It extracts the conversation from the tab, and sends said conversation to our back-end. The back-end was built using Flask, hosted on marktai.com. The back-end takes in the conversation text that the front-end sent it, and analyzes it for keywords. It then searches CSG's API based on description and categories, and returns appropriate movies, which the front-end copies to the clipboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble extracting the conversation without also extracting the names of people. To solve this problem, we identified names before we extracted the conversation, and then we added pieces of the conversation. Since names and messages had the same class name, if the element we extracted was equivalent to a name, we did not add that name to the string that we returned to the back-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created an efficient solution to choose a movie without much indecision.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use CSG's API and what makes the API unique, and, when combined with out front-end and OMDB's API, produce optimal results.
