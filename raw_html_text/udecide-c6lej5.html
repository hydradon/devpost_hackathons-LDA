                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    High school students face a lot of difficulty finding their true calling and making the right choice when choosing the right university and program for themselves. Providing them with a platform where they can explore and shortlist the best places for themselves makes this life-changing transition much easier. As students that have been through the same process, an app like this that helps UDecide is exactly what we needed!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    UDecide helps you decide what parameters are most important to you and generates an outcome that is personalized for your preferences and gives you a real real perspective of the things that interest you and where they can lead you in life. Not only does this save students from a lot of wasted research time, but it also helps them gain a perspective on career prospects and utilization of skills.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first attempted to build the front end using react bootstrap but finally ended up making it with HTML. The back end was made using firebase and the two were linked.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While making the front end, we were using react bootstrap. But the version we downloaded didn't have an o'clock function and we ended up making almost a complete layout that basically didn't function around halfway through the Hackathon. We had to switch over to raw HTML and redo the entire thing. But it was really fun learning how react works and we look forward to working with it in the future.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are all beginners at coding with previous coding experience in varying levels in various languages. The Hackathons challenged our ability to learn new languages as well as to perform under pressure. It was nice seeing how dividing the work amongst the team helped boost efficiency and the experience taught us that we won't learn unless we try and that you have to put yourself out there irrespective of the outcome because unless you do, you won't know what it will ever be.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned how to use react and nom libraries, refreshed our app-development skills and figured out how to use firebase to connect back-end to front-end of our web-app.
                </p>

                    What's next for UDecide
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UDecide can be applied to a broader regimes by tailoring the algorithm and database to incorporate more levels(kindergarten to high school) of education, health, social services, sports aspirations or literally any other facility. Empowering users with tools to take their futures into their own hands is what gives them a clear perspective and that's what our aim is.
