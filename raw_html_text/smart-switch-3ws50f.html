                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do you want to make your old home smart? Control your switches from anywhere in your home? Are you stuck with old switches and appliances? We all have moments of small frustration when we forget to turn off the light switch or have to get up to turn on a fan. A device connected to a phone app that toggles switches will allow one to gain remote access to everything in a home with a switch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, new homes and buildings are getting smarter and smarter but old homes are falling behind due to old infrastructure. So, we took it upon ourselves to develop a solution for old homes to get smarter without making any modifications to the existing switch. If you look at the big picture, there is a huge opportunity for ioT devices that make old homes and buildings smart. Our solution focuses on retrofitting old switches, transforming them into smart devices without any electrical or functional modifications to it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have developed a solution to make your existing old switches smart. Our solution is an intelligently designed retrofit device that can be mounted on top of your existing switches and controlled using a phone app via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Once the device is mounted, you can control your switch remotely using your phone. We were so thoughtful that we designed our solution in such a way that you can still manually control the switch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Arduino 101&rsquo;s BLE capabilities to connect it to an android app. So by clicking a button on the app, a signal is sent to the Arduino 101 that powers a servo motor. The motor rotates the connected blade which toggles the switch on/off. The servo motor is intelligently turned at angles that turn the switch on/off without compromising the manual switch functionality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to come up with a design to mount the servo motor on top of the original switch in an orientation to turn the switch on/off. Also, coming up with a universal design to mount the device on all switches proved to be very difficult as each machinery is physically unique. We also wanted our design to not obstruct the manual functionality and it took us some time to come up with a non-obstructive design. The 3D printed design was few centimeters longer than the switch we used in the video as we developed it using measurements from another switch. So, in future we will add adjustable design functionality. Importantly, we had a hard time making our solution visually appealing at the same time without sacrificing its functionalities. So, our team decided that making the switch visually appealing and reducing the physical form factor, will be done as a separate project as a next step.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of developing an effective retrofit design to be mounted on top of the light switch and connect the Android app to the switch to successfully toggle the light switch. We realized that most of the solutions that are in the market require electrical modifications to the switch or changing the switch entirely. Therefore, we are proud that our solution is very unique and addresses a niche market need. We are also proud that we kept the manual switch functionality intact and thus provide dual functionality (auto and manual). Importantly, we are so proud and honour to be part of the Intel Hackathon and how far we have come along as a team.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Providing electricity usage feedback:  We can do this by tracking the amount of time the switch is ON and calculating the joules of energy used based on the regional average. Then we can calculate the cost of electricity used and give feedback on amount of dollars spent on electricity.
