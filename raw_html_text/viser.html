                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration for the project came chiefly from our interest in providing common people a way to assist in their community and the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Provides map services that connect users with volunteer opportunities across the global community (carpooling and trash cleanup for now) through which they can earn points by entering a confirmation code verifying their volunteer work (an incentive) and climb a leaderboard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio, the app development IDE that most of us are familiar with. In addition, for many of the graphics/visual effects in the app, we used Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. We also used Google Firebase to support networking on our app (the server holds information such as the users' account data and event data).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trouble updating information on the Firebase/retrieving that information in a reliable and safe manner (we had update listeners that were inadvertently modifying the contents of the Firebase).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the maps functionality to work, where people can actively view the opportunities/other people/events available seamlessly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Formatting of UI components is something that we are not very familiar with; when we first starting developing the app, a lot of the elements on the screen appeared askew and irregular - this issue was progressively minimized as we learned how to anchor elements properly, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Viser
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Definitely adding more categories of volunteer service that use the maps - right now we only have Carpooling and Community Cleanup - in the future, we can expand to far more options than just these two, increasing the breadth and accessibility of Viser.
                </p>
