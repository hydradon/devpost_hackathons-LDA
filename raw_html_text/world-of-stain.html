                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What if instead of a free for all kill fest, you had to hunt a target before someone hunted you.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Side scrolling 3D point-shoot video game with an added twist. Gun drops with assigned colors that determined who you can and can not kill. Collect a certain drop color to bring down the leader and drop their score with your own kills, or collect your own color to save yourself but have no way to attack. Or ignore the rules completely and just push your friends off the edge!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Three D modeling in Blender ported over to Unity. All assets coded from scratch in C# for maximum control over game metrics.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Neither of us had ever worked with Unity or Blender and we both had very limited experience with C# before Saturday.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of this! It was no easy task making this function and the fact that it functions well with only 24 hours of work is nothing short of amazing! With about 4 hours of sleep between us we managed to create a game with every single base goal and several of our stretch goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity, C#, Blender, and plenty of game design and theory.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for World of Stain
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rework for cleaner code and reaching the last of our stretch goals. Online play would allow for the addition of a 4th player. Models need to be cleaned up as well preferably with something other than Blender. We also have some ideas for longer range support and goals that will keep us busy for a long time.
