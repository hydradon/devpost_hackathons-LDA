                    Idea was to create an application for patients so there is an effective system in place for patients to securely access their prescriptions, immunization records, questionnaires
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This allows for an electronic copy of anything they might need:
Everything is easier to read - overcomes the doctor&rsquo;s  &ldquo;handwriting&rdquo; barrier
Less chances for fraud practices taking place
Everything is organized in one place 
There are some jobs which require immunization records so this gives them easy access anytime an employer asks for it
The interface can be made in such a way that it is accessible for all users
Unique idea for an application that has not been implemented before
