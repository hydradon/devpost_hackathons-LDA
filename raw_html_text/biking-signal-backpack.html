                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want biking experience to be better and safer, at the same time maintain the cool looking that people would like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backpack has building in Arudino with sewn LED that is able to flash when there are things within certain distance behind. At the same time, bicylists can give tuning signal shown on the back for nighttime visibility or just to act cool. 
Sensoring the distance behind you and give signals when it's close to you. Give turning left/right signal when you want to turn so the people/car/bike is aware of what you want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino with breadbaord and LEDs swen on backpack.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning it was very hard to turn ideas into design. We also needed to consider the accessbility and what we have in hand. Overall the hardware part is hard but we also had good time exploring stuff we never touched before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really had fun together and enjoyed working with each other, encouraging each other, and solving problems together for stuff we are both passinate about. At the same time, we learnd a lot as outside classroom experience and exploring new stuff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To work together and encouraging each other when facing problems.
