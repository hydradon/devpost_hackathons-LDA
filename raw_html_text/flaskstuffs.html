                    Inspiration: We Want to Make Composing Music More Accessible
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted creators to instantly capture moments of inspirations by allowing humming to be transformed into audio files or piano music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It takes a live audio file that then converts it to piano music if the user wishes to convert it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and JS to build the website or frontend. We wrote our backend with python and extracted the files from the website using flask.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We quickly ran into challenges involving the python algorithm that interprets the sound. The main problem was dealing with background noise which would be converted to very low notes, contributing to strange chords which we had to clean up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make an attractive website with a working algorithm that could effectively convert humming to piano music.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flask takes a lot of time to incorporate and we should have been more keen on that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hummer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to better implement flask with other drag and drop libraries and ultimately expand it to other instruments and sheet music.
