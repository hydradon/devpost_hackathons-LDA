                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In today's century, kids would rather play games and watch movies than study. A survey shows that most teachers use digital games in the classroom.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It randomly asks questions based on the category selected with three wrong options and a right answer. The player then selects the answer before shaking the device for the next question.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our project using Android Studio. (Using Java and XML)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Linking our XML files using a button was a major challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As first year students, this is our first game that we have produced and worked on. We are proud we made it work successfully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt new skills in Android studio, for example, we learn't how to like the button with another XML file.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for How much do you Know???
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to expand the game, covering different areas of study for children, rather than just colours.
