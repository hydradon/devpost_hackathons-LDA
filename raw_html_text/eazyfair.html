                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Found myself at a career fair with over 100 of companies and a list of the ones I wanted to see. But I had to keep going back and forth through the maps; therefore, decided on making something that would show me where everything I want to know is!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EazyFair is a Web App that allows you to upload the picture of the layout of a convention center. For example:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img alt="example" data-canonical-url="https://i.gyazo.com/ad9c97b218014713b141407327bba278.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--3NpxDbS6--/c_limit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto:eco,w_900/https://i.gyazo.com/ad9c97b218014713b141407327bba278.png">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then the areas 115, could be selected and this area would be then known as 115 or whatever it was told to be known as.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img alt="example selction" data-canonical-url="https://i.gyazo.com/932349b01f1cf6564ae3f707eaa1b8de.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--ZJpvLonO--/c_limit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto:eco,w_900/https://i.gyazo.com/932349b01f1cf6564ae3f707eaa1b8de.png">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then 115, can be associated with something else for example: We could say it can be google
and 116 can  be Wells Fargo. 
Then when you are a convention center or career fair and choose google would light up.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Re-enforced some previous experience I had with MongoDb and JavaScript.

                    What's next for EazyFair
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After this part is completed. I will try to utilize iBeacons (Bluetooth 4.0 ) to build indoor positioning systems that will guide you to the booth or area you wanted to go to. This can be used at career fairs, convention centers, comicons, theme parks and more!
