                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Aarnav and I went to the same school and lived 3 blocks away, yet we didn't know each other. My grandparents and Aarnav's parents met at the park, and we started carpooling. We wanted to make a website where people could easily connect with each other for carpooling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website connecting people in the same area so they can carpool with each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML, CSS, and PHP to complete the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had zero ounces of knowledge about PHP, and with help from a mentor, we were able to finish much of the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of learning about PHP and expanding our knowledge in other languages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about PHP, and with a lot of googling, we also discovered new things about HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PoolWithMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand the site to many zip codes in the country and we would like to add more schools along with making the PHP better. We would also like to use addresses to make it more specific.
