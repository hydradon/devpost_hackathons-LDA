                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On our first date, Curtis and I bonded over our common love of apps, hackathons, and storytelling. We talked at length about how we enjoyed Choose Your Own Adventure books, and how we listened to audiobooks more than read books! A year and a half later, our dream comes to fruition - Choose Your Own Adventure Audiobooks!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also am a writer, with many writer and voice actor friends. I wanted to make something that would help them use their talent to bring joy to many many people.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lore aims to be a platform for storytellers and voice actors to create interactive audiobooks. It starts off with a story, which can take crazy twists and turns depending on what choices you make, as a listener. Currently, we take yes/no voice inputs. We plan to expand to use fitness tracker data and GPS data as well!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio to write the app in Java.

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Finding a quiet environment to record our demo in, getting mp3s to play offline. 
Integrating speech recognition as a background process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Making a dream come true! 
Creating something that would be useful to several friends, both on the creative side, as well as consumers. 
Designing and coding in a more organized way than we have at hackathons past.
