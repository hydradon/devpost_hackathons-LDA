                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As university students, we have busy schedules and tend to forget things quite often unless organized. We've learned that time management is key and we are trying to help people have a more organized life which will lead to a more productive, happy way of living.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This device is meant to be placed somewhere easily visible for reminders and its other features. The device is more for people with busy days, especially mornings, and need to stay on top of things. The device displays important information such as time, outside temperature, tasks that the user sets, alarm to wake the user up in the morning or for other purposes if they wish and a physical calendar that lets you write information and gives you positive messages everyday to start your day with a positive mood!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the device using the Arduino (UNO) starter kit, an extra Arduino (101) and the Arduino IDE program using C++ to code the device. We also used physical objects (Cardboard, Notebook) to make a visual representation of the device as a prototype. In addition, we used Adobe Photoshop to make a digital sketch of what we imagine the final product to look like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge was using two different Arduino platforms and combining the two in a circuit. This challenged us both within the hardware and especially in the software as we had to improvise. Many times it glitched and had trouble uploading, so we spent a lot of time troubleshooting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishment
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a device that connects both Arduino Platforms (UNO and 101) in a circuit despite having different code. We accomplished building the device physically and having it performs all the functions that we intended.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Engineering and building a product requires a lot of patience due to the many small errors/glitches/defects in hardware that are present. In addition, we learned that troubleshooting plays a very important role.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smart Calendar
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the future of Smart Calendar, we want to improve this device by connecting it to the users phone using bluetooth/wifi and getting the user to input information through their phones instead of manually. In addition, we would like to add a thermister (as we did not have access to it) to measure temperature. To add, we would want to make a variety of versions depending on the consumer and his/hers needs or wants. The top level one would let the consumer talk to the calendar to input information and ask basic question (e.g. calculations) along with making it a projection that you can interact with.
