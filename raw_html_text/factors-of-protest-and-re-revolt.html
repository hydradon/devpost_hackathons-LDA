                <p>
                    By looking at the database provided, we suppose that there may be a correlation between the chance of uprisings and other factors, such as protester group's demand, government's response, whether the protest was violent and the free status of the country, collected from freedom of the house.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an analysis (demo,50% finished) setting the dependent variable as the frequency of protests and independent variables as the factors mentioned above.

                <p>
                    We have been cleaning up the data in excel by removing some unusable data in excel, which are the data that would influence the outcome of the analysis, such as some protest cases that provide no data on any of the factors we mentioned.(Did not finish)
Then we wrote a python program to read data in the csv file so we can tally up the frequency of uprisings for cases in the same year, same country with the same grievances demanded by the same group of protestors. The python program also helped us to generate a new csv file that can be converted into excel file. The file contains the values of the variables.
With the excel file we obtained, we conducted a data analysis on the set of data, which would generate equations showing

                        some errors are encountered while drawing usable data from excel by python.

                        computers are not good enough to handle such amount of data (crashes a lot of time).

                    We did not really accomplish anything but a hard time we worked is our best accomplishment.

## What's next for Factors of protest and re-revolt.
We believe government response can be a critical factor of protest and re-revolt.
