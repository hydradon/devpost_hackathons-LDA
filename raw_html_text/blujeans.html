                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had always taken an interest in bioinformatics, and we wanted to create a project based on people's genetic profiles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows one to sign up utilizing Twilio and Docusign APIs, which makes the process very smooth and efficient. Then it connects people together based on several different personality and physical traits with data from GenomeLink. One can filter certain traits as well as hit a random button to meet another person with a completely random genetic profile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it with love and pride.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to US Federal Law, we do not have access to the complete human genome. That means we currently work with demo data restricted to the European population and can only view 10 traits at a time.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to work on a team of accomplished and skilled programmers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deploying a web server, extrapolating data from APIs, linking SMS with HTML, authorizing users with OAuth, and being able to live off of Soylent and Pizza for 2 days.

                    What's next for blujeans
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As we continue developing blujeans and get approvals from various American law agencies, we would continue to evolve blujeans to great heights.
