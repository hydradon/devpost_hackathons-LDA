                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing what to eat often has more to do with emotion than logic than most people think. Understanding this can help us make smart plans for healthy living.

                <p>
                    Based on the user's response to a daily prompt, our program determines a meal package to deliver to the user. For example, a discontented user would be given some healthy comfort food, like frozen yogurt or pesto pasta.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Flask to connect the SendGrid API and Watson API to my webpage. This allowed me to send email receipts and determine which foods to offer to users. I used an open-source HTML5UP html base that I modified with JQuery. The front end used CSS and HTML5UP with SASS and Font Awesome for graphics.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had a tough time being able to incorporate html-styling into the SendGrid system and having Flask serve up my style sheets. I worked with the SendGrid representative for several hours to diagnose (and eventually fix) the problems.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud I was able to incorporate new technologies I had not used before and did not give up even when a technical problem took hours to

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to change environment variables, debug in new ways and how Flask can serve up different projects.

                <h2>
                    What's next for MoodFood
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MoodFood could be a viable business that dieters turn to because of its ability to make healthy eating a more natural part of life.
