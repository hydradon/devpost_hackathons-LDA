                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Eating meat creates a huge environmental impact, even if we are unaware. This app attempts to help users visualize the negative effects of their everyday food choices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To visualize the environmental impact of food choices, the app generates a visual farm that displays various common livestock. This serves as the user's "farm" that illustrates their meat consumption history. At the end of each day, users enter the amount of meat they consumed. Once this is recorded, the app calculates whether or not their consumption is greater or less than the average meat consumed in a typical day. If it is greater, the corresponding animal in their farm is "killed"; if it is less than average, an animal gets added to their farm. Users will be able to track how their weekly consumption compares to average weekly consumption in the Analytics tab of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app was built using Java and Android Studio. Photoshop was used to make the splash screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to make the graphs in the Analytics tab, we used a third party library. We had difficulty at first understanding and properly implementing it for our needs. With research and experimentation, we were able to successfully incorporate this into our application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, our group consists of members with little to no experience in Android app development. It was a struggle to get everyone up and running; through collaboration and effort, we were able to put together an application we are all proud of.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to think of an idea and successfully execute it through a functional app made from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all learned more about Android development, such as layouts, XML, making graphics and passing data between fragments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Farm Citi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to implement a better visual for the farm in the next iteration. By consolidating all the current cells into one farm, we will be able to create a more visually appealing app that attracts users. Additionally, we would like to visually represent the impacts of eating too much meat on water and the air through a pond and smog in the farm. Finally, it is important for consumers to know that
                    <em>
                        all
                    </em>
                    their food choices have an impact on the environment; though we targeted meat choices in this iteration, we would like to branch out into other food types in the future.
