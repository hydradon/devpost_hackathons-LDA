                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students we want to make a start-up product that would benefit our mental health and stress levels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Monitors your brain waves and notifies you of your stress levels, quality of focus and sleep, and with development, could be used to predict neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Used circuitry to connect the arduino with the bluetooth and attempted to pair the bluetooth with the Mindwave headset.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our bluetooth (HC05) was unable to compile or recognize our Mindwave device. We spent a total of around six hours attempting to fix this issue. Unfortunately, due to our lack of bluetooth device knowledge and experience and materials we were able to use, we could not fix this issue in time. We do however, plan on working on this project to further develop it and hopefully market it to the healthcare system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We refused to quit and give up even though we faced a serious issue and made lots of progress in terms of what we learned as first year undergraduates. We did the best we could with what we had available to communicate with the arduino, bluetooth, and Mindwave.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to work with an arduino uno and bluetooth module and how to program such devices.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Detecting Brain Waves
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully being able to detect neurodegenerative diseases in their early states so that they can be cured!
