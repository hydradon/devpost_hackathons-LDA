                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All the members of our team had experienced the problem of adjusting the headphones' volume using the control buttons in different environments. We thought about developing the audio based equivalent of the adaptive brightness system in mobile phones. This seemed to be a fun learning experience and we dedicated our efforts to it.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program uses real time microphone monitoring to analyze the current levels of noise in the immediate surroundings. Based on the audio levels, it calculates the optimal volume for output and gradually adjusts the current level to the optimal level automatically.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To perform real time microphone monitoring, we utilized the Soundmeter API to obtain the root mean square values (RMS) of the surrounding noises over a fixed interval of time. We developed our own scale of optimal volumes corresponding to the RMS volumes using a series of experiments and controls in different noise levels. We integrated the Mac terminal commands into the python file and with the help of an iterator, gradually adjusted the current level to the calculated optimal level, thereby providing a soothing user experience.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We encountered our first challenge within the few starting hours of the Hackathon when we had to decide upon a project amongst the multitude of ideas that were laid on the table by the teammates. After considering achievability and the time constraint, we narrowed down our frame of thoughts to this project. Determining the optimal noise levels corresponding to the RMS values was another puzzle at first sight since it included multiple factors including subjectivity. Finding appropriate APIs that matched our needs was a time consuming yet enriching process.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was our first Hackathon , we achieved something that we had never anticipated. We were elated when we self taught ourselves through the process and managed to pull off a working project within the time constraint. We experienced the practicalities associated with developing a real world software.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We gained more knowledge about the audio management system in a Mac and the corresponding scaling. We learned about the utility of several modules in python and acquired the skills that would be used in future Hackathons and independent projects.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Adaptive Audio System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project has the scope of being expanded into an Android/iOS application which can be compatible with other devices such as external speakers, bluetooth earpieces.
A smart Home system could integrate the application and use it to adjust the speakers' volume according to different situations such as a house function and so on.
The stereo systems of vehicles could utilize the applications in the opposite sense to increase the driver's safety. For example, in case of loud honking or changes in surroundings such as an ambulance passing by, the volume would decrease and allow the driver to perform the appropriate tasks.
