                    A successful business knows what its customers need and feel about their products. Therefore we developed a tool for generating Emotion Analysis about a business.
                </p>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) we are training a model to classify emotional state of a person writing that review.
Using those classifications we are providing analysis report about emotion distribution of that business

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used tensorflow library to train LSTM to classify emotional state.
We used SemEval 2007 Task 14 for training data.
Using Flask we created web application's architecture
User review about a business were collected by scraping Yelp website.
Reviews were classified using trained LSTM model and report was generated using Matplotlib.
