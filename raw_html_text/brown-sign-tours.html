                    Inspiration

                <p>
                    People travel for work or leisure frequently. If one has time to kill, It might be fun to explore.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used Node as a basic server of a single web page. I used angular, with primarily angular google maps directives, to display the map and routes. I used google-maps-utility-library to calculate route boxes, then fed these route boxes into Expedia's points of interest bounded box search. I then use google search for general information on the locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm new to web development and the above api in particular, I struggled for too long trying to figure out basic things like importing script files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I designed a usable application to assist in location discovery! It's really fun to use and look around, I'm very pleased.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can do a lot on the client side. I barely used any of Node. Was surprised.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Brown Sign Tours
                </h2>
                <p>
                    route based tripping planning is one generalization, more tools to collect where people travel, and where people stop. Basic usability features to make it a little nicer to use. There are lots of directions one can go.
