                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to Statistics Canada, 54 per cent of Canadians eat out once a week or more, and 40 per cent of folks say they eat out for convenience, have no time to cook, or do not like/know how to cook. Additionally, 40% of Canadian post-secondary students experience food insecurity, meaning almost half of all Canadian University students do not have reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food. Hasty seeks to tackle the problem of food insecurity in Canadian univeristy campuses by providing an easy and cheap alternative to eating out.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hasty is designed to help students prepare easy, healthy, and tasty meals. Hasty is an interactive recipe website that takes the planning out of cooking. Based on the amount of time and ingredients available to you, Hasty provide a range of recipes in a step-by-step format. We have timers embedded into the steps to allow students to work on other projects while their food is cooking in the oven.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hasty is a simple Javascript website that stores recipes in a series of arrays in the local cache. It then displays each item in these arrays - such as ingredients and recipe steps - in an easy-to-follow sequential order. It also uses arrays of types of steps in a recipe to load relevant images and features such as a countdown timer along with each step.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our original team consisted of three developers, one of whom knows Javascript. Unfortunately he was not able to make it, leaving our team with no one who knows Javascript. To overcome this challenge, our primary developer learned Javascript while working on Hasty.

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    As a team with little previous software development experience, we learned much about managing a project of this type.
