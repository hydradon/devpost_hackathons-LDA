                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    to familiarize my self how hackers create a backdoor and how they can be used to try to gain access to a target so that I am able to prevent such fraudulent activity in the future
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it opens the desired port specified by the hacker,  where the hacker can gain access to the system and do whatever he/she wants to the target machine, but also once the backdoor is executed it would look for systems users and send them to the hacker
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    it was built using python
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to implement a keylogger with the backdoor and the system user credential stealer but the keylogger was complicated to implement because I was running into a lot of errors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the backdoor being able to work successfully and being able to add more stuff on it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    how to create the backdoor and use different data hiding techniques to make the backdoor unseen or seem innocent (example by hiding it behind a pdf file or image)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Backdoor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    the next thing is to add a keylogger and upload or download capabilities
                </p>
