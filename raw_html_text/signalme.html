                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Augmented reality is a new stepping stone for us, but we wanted to apply it in such a way that let's us visualize real time information as it relates to our environment!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SignalMe is an AR based information diagnostic tool, with the primary function of placing bubbles within your space to represent the signal strength at your exact position. These bubbles are kept in place and serve as a mapping of signal strength within an entire area!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wrote custom plugins in C# and Java for Unity and borrowed some others from the Unity asset store to deliver a functional experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding how to work with the Android framework can be intimidating at first. There are many logistical elements to keep track of but once everything is taken care of, it's great to have a functioning smartphone app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went from ideation to proof of concept in less than 6 hours! Seeing the first set of objects continuously generating on the screen was an exciting first moment for our taste-test of Android development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a HUGE leap forward into AR and App development using Unity, Vuforia, ARCore, and Android Studio. From nothing to a well-established basic understanding of AR app development on Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SignalMe
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to improve the app to deliver more information in a friendlier and easy-to-use way!
