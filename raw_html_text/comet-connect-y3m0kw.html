                    Inspiration: Our team was immidiately interested in the challenges involving UT Dallas since we know so much about the university. We initially attempted to work with Amazon Alexa Skills, but unfortunately it didn't work out. We switched gears to creating a website with our mission being the website should serve as a mentor or a guide to students.

                <h2>
                    What it does: Comet Connect offers helpful information that only past students or long term students would know, such as good study spots or personal anecdotes.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: Since we are all pre-med majors and don't have a programming background, we decided to make a website through wix.com. This seemed the most approachable and realistic method to compete a project while still challenging ourselves.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: Originally, when we tried completing the Amazon Alexa challenge, we struggled with test simulating our sample questions and answers. Once we changed directions towards an app or website, we struggled finding a suitable app maker where minimal programming was required. At that point, since I had prior experience with wix.com, we decided that was a good route to take.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We're proud of the content we came up with for the website. We reached out to several peers to gather anecdotes, advice/tips, good study spots, little known campus resources, etc. After compiling all of this information, we created a website to properly display this helpful information for other students benefit from.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned that though this challenge was a lot more than we expected, we can still manage to produce something creative for the world to benefit from and to use, even without a programming background.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Comet Connect: Our next step would be to speak to a wider array of students and gather more tips that may be helpful. We want the website to be as informational as possible, while still retaining its personal touch, and its "from a friend, to a friend" vibe.
