                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Almost every student in today's era has a Facebook account. Because of this, Facebook Messenger chat bots are low hassle, easily accessible utilities that are soon to be the future for our generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taking inspiration from already existing Messenger bots, such as "Hi Poncho", the weather bot was a big inspiration to kickstart our own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, the college struggle to keep track of class assignments has increased as business ensues, hence creating the idea for this project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This bot reads course syllabus' and schedules, then stores important dates to a database where it can remind the user in advance before any of the assignments are due. It also allows users input to add and edit their own classes and is flexible to accommodate for classes that require more than just a syllabus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used AWS EC2, to host an Apache web server, under a Domain.com domain, and a Namecheap certificate, to connect the Facebook API with a server-side PHP application that utilizes a MySQL database, and a Java file parser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Facebook required a verified certificate with our bot's connection. Which began a 12-hour endeavor to get our own certified domain without spending any money (because we're broke). We got that SSL certificate. Still not sure how.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got our own SSL certificate!
Our bot is warm, friendly, and made from scratch, with love, and a future.
There's like 5 different languages we utilized as a team to make this work! And everyone learned something new.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS doesn't let students create web certificates for free, nevermind host our own domains.
You can get an SSL certificate for free in a non-sketchy manner. But what does that mean about our internet today?
$_REQUEST does not contain Facebook API data, you need to run some more PHP code before it's in.
Dreamweaver is very nice for web development.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LookOwt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will extend on the hospitality that our bot is capable of.
We also need to make our parser work better on more than 1 single class syllabus.
