                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team members have a casual interest in cooking. We brainstormed a way we could improve the experience of cooking for people like us who don't cook often. Current voice assistants are inadequate for novice cooks so we thought it would be useful to create a hands free experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Breaks down online recipes into easy to follow steps. Ensures users are well prepared for their cooking (ingredients/utensils).

                <p>
                    First time using Android Studio for all of our members. Had trouble compiling everything for the first time, as well as navigating through the different tools available.

                    What's next for Cooking Buddy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Functionality to scrape recipes online into a format. Live text-speech conversion. Timer integration for specific instructions. (e.g boil for 10 min). Cleaner UX design with more visuals to assist with cooking technique (e.g whisking GIF).
