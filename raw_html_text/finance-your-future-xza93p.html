                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the various sponsors that were at SheHacks. Many institutions wanted to work on improving financial literacy in youth which we thought was an important issue to address. As youth ourselves, we felt that it was important to work on improving the financial literacy of the youth around us. Financial literacy is an important skill that even many adults lack. Knowing financial skills can help in leading a successful life.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app works on providing simulations of savings accounts and stock market investing that works with artificial currency to help improve understanding of the mentioned financial concepts. The neat twist is that the artificial currency is actually an incentive to improve one's financial skills. The more

                        coins
                    </em>
                    one gains, the more discounts or rewards points they can gain towards using in real life. An example of a store one can use their coins at would be Microsoft, in our app preview.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app preview on Figma using CSS. Our graphics were taken from the open source website

                    </a>
                    . We worked on developing a user friendly app that would be intuitive, informative, and enjoyable.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our entire team is a group of first-time hackers with little to no previous experience in coding. Our challenges laid in not knowing where to start or even knowing coding language.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the idea we developed into an app preview in under 24 hours. As first-time hackers, we find it impressive that we managed to create an app preview that is clean, intuitive, engaging, and useful.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Figma, learned more about CSS, and we learned what goes on behind-the-scenes in developing a user friendly app.

                <p>
                    We hope that this idea can be used to fully develop an app for youth that can be used to educate on and improve financial skills.
