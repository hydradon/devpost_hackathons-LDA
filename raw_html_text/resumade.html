                    In the modern job market, the treatment of r&eacute;sum&eacute;s in the hiring process is changing, in a shift toward online and digital. It is difficult for inexperienced applicants to make the most of word processor r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, when they are burdened by proprietary file formats and don't display succinctly in web browsers. HTML, of course, is the definition of succinct on a web browser. Unfortunately, though, not everyone has the knowledge to craft up a r&eacute;sum&eacute; in markup language. To make this potential accessible, we created R&eacute;sumade.

                    Users sign into our site and manage a portfolio of r&eacute;sum&eacute;s for different kinds of positions. All r&eacute;sum&eacute;s are hosted under their name at ready, to be sent by link to HR personnel when applying. In addition, R&eacute;sumade features conversion of .docx and .pdf files into HTML, and provides a selection of CSS templates to make them look nice.
