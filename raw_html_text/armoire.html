                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well first we drank a lot of Starbucks.....I mean a lot of it and then we cracked open our good friend google to figure out how to spell Armoire then you know we used a little CSS, some python, got a little of that bottle action going...and topped it off with a pretty awesome weather API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spelling Armoire my god that part wasn't fun lol we didn't run into too many challenges working with the weather API was a little difficult but we pulled it off.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We spelled Armoire correctly. That we we're able to use our own individual skills collectively to solve any issues the group faced and that everything works very smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That people from different  disciples can come together and create something that benefits both sides equally....that and spelling....spelling was HUGE!
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    We want to improve the over all experience by letting you compare your outfit to something Armoire has suggested for one of your friends using Armoire. Also there exist may retail applications that Armoire can be used for like suggesting clothes based on retailers that you frequent or even making suggestions in store for you to try on based off of your own individual style.
