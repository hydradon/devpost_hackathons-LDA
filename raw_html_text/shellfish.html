                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After seeing countless videos of how litter negatively affects wildlife, the team was determined to create a project that would create the same emotional response as we had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope that this project brings awareness to the dangers of littering in our environment and shows how confusing it can be for wildlife.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity3D and C# to make our project into a small video game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the repository was a problem for our team. Git gave us a few problems and different branches created merge issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The art, as we never thought we personally could make anything as pretty as this. Also the emotional impact the ending has.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How much litter actually affects sea turtles in particular, which is why we choose the animal. One of our members had their first experience with Unity as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shellfish
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the game more detailed and complete. We would like to include more stages with different affected animals, as well as have a more concrete leveling up process.
                </p>
