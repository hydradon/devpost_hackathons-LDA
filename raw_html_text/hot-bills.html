                    Hot Bills allows users to create an account and register with local and state governments to receive notifications of legislative actions.

                    . Users can choose to subscribe to only certain topics that they wish to hear more about. Hot Bills also allows users to submit approval / neutral / disapproval feedback on legislative actions that can be loaded by politicians in real time. In this way,

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    The UiPath learning curve is very steep, and we weren't able to achieve as much automation as we would've liked.

                <p>
                    Linking the Flask server to the MongoDB database through Heroku was challenging, and required a lot of trial and error and long build times.

                <p>
                    We would love to be able to set up a server running a UiPath webscraping workflow so that the database would be updated continuously for participating locations. Moreover, being able to send push notifications to users as legislative actions happened would help the app fully achieve its original goal.
