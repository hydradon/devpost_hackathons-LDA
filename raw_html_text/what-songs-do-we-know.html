                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Olivia: "I got the idea a few years ago while visiting a friend in Seattle who also sings folk songs from the Republic of Georgia and leads a choir over there. She had this big feast/party with singing, and I knew her friends and I must have so much repertoire in common but didn't know where to begin!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Connor: "I came in just looking for an idea that sounded interesting. I had never done much web programming, and this seemed like a unique way to start."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WSDWK uses the Facebook Graph API/PHP SDK to get information about events and cross-references the attendee list with its own user database. For each event, users can see a list of the songs that people attending the event know, sorted by popularity. They can also view and edit the list of songs they know.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly in PHP, running on a local XAMPP web server/MySQL instance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    AWS free tier not supporting the latest version of PHP, which meant that after a long configuration process, we had to start fresh with a different setup.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting something that runs, honestly--we're both new to this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to pull a project together and find the information we need to make it work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for What Songs Do We Know?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we can get the app into shape to pass Facebook's review process, we'll pull in all events the user can see, not just public ones. And although our first use case was folk songs, this model could be extended to a lot of things: games, programming skills, and so on.
