                    We have built an Android 3D game using Unity. We used 3D builder to render our models for things such as trees, houses, tunnels, etc. within our game. We then used Artificial Intelligence in our main character, Shrek. We will discuss more about this topic in our presentation. We used Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator to create in app logos and icons.
