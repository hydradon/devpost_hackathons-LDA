                    Utilizing zero-knowledge proofs on Ethereum is an obvious progression for polling platforms that handle sensitive data. This layer of security, backed by cryptographic proofs, is perfect for applications in politics and finance. Referendum is a voting platform that utilizes Aztec&rsquo;s privacy protocol to enable confidential sentiment aggregation. Data consumers may also use Referendum&rsquo;s marketplace features to bid out specific and hard to get information. Because the security of our users&rsquo; personal data and preferences is protected by mathematical proofs rather than any single point of failure, polls will enjoy the benefits of anonymous signaling. This will undoubtedly encourage more honest participation and ensure the most accurate results for the data consumer.
