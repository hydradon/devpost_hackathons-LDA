                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on a previous project I worked on. I wanted to create an app that would allow people to hire others to shovel snow using geolocation. I used this project and this hackathon to access my ability.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It serves two purposes: it allows home owners to hire freelance shovelers to shovel their driveway and street. Inversely, it allows people who are interested in making a few extra bucks, be able to grab their shovels and use the apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built it using the Ionic Framework, which allows you to deploy Android and IOS apps using html, css and javascript
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time was probably the biggest challenge. I didn't have enough time to flush out all of the features, like verification. There are also a lot of bugs and holes to patch up.
