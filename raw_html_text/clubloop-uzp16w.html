                    The Birth of Clubloop:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Clubloop was created with the thought that club news should be easy to send and receive.
                    </strong>
                    Clubloop was an idea that I came up with for MIT Launch. Our team did not decide to pursue my idea, leaving it behind. But I realized there was potential behind my idea, so I decided to pursue this idea at a hackaton.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What Clubloop Does:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clubloop is currently a prototype for a plug-in that would work for any school grading website(ie. School Loop, Aeries, ThinkWave, etc.). The objective of Clubloop is to allow school club leaders to efficiently contact club members with important information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I Built It:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To build the prototype of Clubloop, I went into inspect element on the School Loop website and copied the website in HTML into Notepad++. Afterwards, I coded the desired area for Clubloop to be in and added a couple of examples for what the news would look like.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I Had:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most challenges that I ran into were related to HTML, since this is my first time ever using it to code. After get help from mentors and watching some tutorials, I was able to figure out the issues in the code and fix them. Another major area of challenge was GitHub and Git. I have never used either before, so it took time for me to get used to the functions of both.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned to clone, add, commit, and push code into Github by using Git and the command prompt, which really made me interested in HTML, a language that I have never used before. I believe that this experience will really change my coding life, since I am more static coder, using only Java and Android, but now I feel like I can become a more dynamic coder, using more variation of code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next for Clubloop:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Currently, Clubloop is just a plug-in prototype on School Loop, but in the near future I want to code a website with HTML and JavaScript, so that Clubloop can become a stand- alone site that people could use to keep track of club news. But my real goal is to propose this idea to School Loop, or any other school grading website, so they could implement it onto their website, which would help many students in the future to deliver and receive club news all on one site.
