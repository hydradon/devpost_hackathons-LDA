                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have been interested in speedcubing for almost a year by the time I created this website. There were a lot of cubing websites out there, but for the most of them, I never really felt like the content is understandable to a cuber who is just starting out. This is why I created this website: to make it easier for cubers to improve their solving speeds and not lose motivation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My website includes numerous tutorials for both beginner and advanced speedcubers who want to learn new skills to  become faster at speedsolving.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this website using JavaScript and CSS for the text and background, and I also did some minor, but necessary image editing on Apple Preview.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There were a lot of times where I change one variable, and the whole webpage stops working. That wasn't a major problem, though, and my project ran through quite smoothly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My website had a great start, and a strong baseline that I could build upon later on. I also thought about adding some of my solves from earlier on in the month so that more advanced cubers could clearly see the process of solving any puzzle, and to help them understand that becoming faster at solving the Rubik's Cube is not hard at all. It just requires passion and perseverance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about how to add effects (e.g. Fade in/out, drop-down menus) to my webpage to make it more interesting and feel more professional.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will eventually add new tutorials, new content (competition videos etc.) to make my tutorials more thorough.
