                    Chromosomal Image Recognition A.I.

                    Developed by Surya Vadivazhagu and Daniel McDonough

                <p>
                    C.I.R.A. was developed in response to having a dataset of cells in the human body; especially cells that were fluorescent in varying degrees in response to the potential for tumorous activity in the cell- calculated from whether the cell underwent a malignant misalignment with its proteins or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We wrote an A.I. using Python and various libraries in conglomeration for the purpose of scanning and detecting each cell in a given .TIF image of cells, and using colorspaces to determine whether the cell was tumorous or not. We were able to use the Value attribute after applying a (Hue, Saturation, Value) filter over the image to quantify how bright each cell was.
