                    A procedurally generated maze game on Arduino with a twist of a  heating/cooling gaming wristband. It is played on a limited 2x16 display to encourage users to rely on temperature sensing from the heating/cooling gaming wristband.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I saw thermoelectric cells being used as generators powered by campfire  and after researching them I learned they can be used in reverse to create temperature changes using electricity. I wanted to used them to create an immersive VR experience but due to limitations of a solo hack I decided to prototype a heating/cooling wristband and worry about VR later. I created an Android maze game that used the heating/cooling wristband.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How the gaming wristband works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A thermoelectric cell is set up with an H bridge so  current can be run bidirectionally. One direction for heat generation and the other for heat absorption (aka cooling).

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing a maze generation algorithm that ran Arduino's memory limitations. I had to scrap a implementation of Randomized Kruskal's algorithm implementation for a lighter Randomized  Prim's algorithm implementation.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1kybte of heap and 2kybte of stack requires a different coding mindset for certain algorithm solutions.
