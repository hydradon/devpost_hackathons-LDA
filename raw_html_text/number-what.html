                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Katrine, the designer of our team, is discalcular and has difficulties telling the time on a regular watch. She had an idea that would make it easier for her and others with discalculia to tell the time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The clock is shaped like a pie chart with two colors, a background color and front color. Instead of minute numbers, the front color indicates the time that has passed and the background color indicates the time that is coming. When the minutes of the hour is from 0-29 minutes, the clock shows the hour number of the time passed. But when the minutes of the hour is 30-59 minutes the clock shows the hour number of the time that is coming.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio to develop the clock widget as well as a android-wear watch face. 
We also used pebble-cloud sdk to develop a clock face for a pebble time 2. 
Lastly we used bootstrap to develop a dynamic website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are proud to be the first who has developed a digital clock solving a problem discalcular people ran into every day.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that smartwatches requires a lot of battery charging time. 
We learned how to pronounce discalculia, a big thanks to google translate!

                    We provide the watch faces source codes free for all who struggles with time at GitHub.
