                    628,521&hellip; was the total amount of reported criminal attacks against students on their way to and from school in the US elementary, secondary &amp; universities campuses on 2014. From this amount, around 40 were murders and almost 170,000 were classified as serious violent victimizations such as rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault

                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, between 2001 and 2013 on average 4% of students reported being afraid of an attack or harm on the way to and from school. This makes at least 2 million students in the U.S. (plus their parents) likely to be interested in using the application

                    So, how to improve our youngest&rsquo; safety? How to help them decide which is the safest path to their destination? Or even better, how to watch their steps remotely?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are living in a dynamic world in which everything is evolving at a very fast pace, even the way crimes are committed. We believe that
                    <strong>
                        people&rsquo;s collaboration can make powerful contributions
                    </strong>
                    . Detroiters are already turning this belief into action by releasing the Detroit Strategic Framework Plan which is &ldquo;a guiding blueprint for transforming Detroit from its current state of population loss and excessive vacancy into a model for the reinvention of post-industrial American cities&rdquo; (Griffin, Cramer, &amp; Powers, 2014)

                    </strong>
                    . So the purpose is to design a
                    <strong>
                        community-based &amp; crowdmapping application to enhance public safety by connecting you to a relative or friend by sharing your route so they keep an eye on you
                    </strong>
                    . As the security threats expert Marc Goodman puts it: &ldquo;After all, public safety is too important to leave to the professionals&rdquo;.

                    Although this is an application for any pedestrian and/or driver located in any city, we identified the following reasons for which Detroit, initially, will be interested in this solution:

                <p>
                    The application displays an emergency button to call 911 and it also features a
                    <strong>
                        panic mode which alerts your virtual watcher

                    We envision the application to be compatible with smart cities initiatives, such as street lights that are equipped with motion sensors and cameras. This way Marauder mApp can give life to your route by enabling you and your virtual companion to

                    Although Marauder mApp
                    <strong>
                        can be implemented with smartphone technology alone
                    </strong>
                    , its experience can be enhanced by leveraging car hardware modules (e.g. OpenXC) and city infrastructure such as public lighting technology (e.g. GE Current motion sensors and cameras).

                <p>
                    The video streaming, pedestrian and traffic information rely on the GE Predix platform and its usage of GE Current street lights. The use of

                    to gather this information. Any cameras and other type of sensors with internet capabilities can be integrated with Marauder mApp. For example, the cameras installed on highways by the State of Michigan could be hooked up to provide video (

                <p>
                    The panic mode feature can be enabled with current smartphone technology. Sudden motions such as the phone falling or a user running can be detected both in iOS and Android devices. The panic mode for the vehicle users
                    <strong>
                        can be implemented using the OpenXC platform
                    </strong>
                    . Marauder mApp can be connected to the car ODB-II port via Bluetooth allowing the application to extract information from the vehicle such as the doors, airbag status and vehicle emergency codes.

                    How was the Project built?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Marauder mApp is built on Javascript with Node.js, MongoDB and the Meteor Framework. This is used to create a lightweight web application that can be executed either on desktop or mobile and that can display information on real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To display the information the GE Predix platform is used. The project consumes four Predix microservices: User Account and Authentication, Pedestrian Planning, Public Safety and Traffic Planning. GE&rsquo;s Intelligent Environment Public Safety API service provides real-time and historical images/video from each intelligent LED light installed in a city.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project is able to
                    <strong>
                        trace routes that contain the GE Current streetlights and Cameras as way-points so that the route you take can be watched
                    </strong>
                    . The real time sharing of information is really powerful because the pedestrian does not need to have the phone on the hand, and suspicious activity is noted by the watcher, a message or a phone call will make them change the route.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Projected Use-Case
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alice wants to go from the University to her house late at night after a long study session. She pulls her mobile, opens Marauder mApp and enters her destination, she then decides to send a request to her friend Bob so that he can keep an eye on her journey home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Bob makes himself a sandwich, he gets a few pictures of Alice getting outside of the University from his home computer. Dinner in hand, he checks some images from a couple of blocks ahead of Alice. Seen everything looks fine he goes back to his dinner and starts reading a book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every few blocks the
                    <strong>
                        application asks Alice for a notification on how she's doing
                    </strong>
                    . Bob can look at images from cameras Alice has passed by while he enjoys his evening.
                    <em>
                        (This feature is not included on the Demo yet)
                    </em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After some time into his placid watch, Bob gets a
                    <strong>
                        notification
                    </strong>
                    to his mobile. Turns out some
                    <strong>
                        pedestrian activity
                    </strong>
                    has been
                    <strong>
                        detected
                    </strong>
                    some blocks away from Alice. With a few clicks Bob checks the images from around that area. It looks like a couple took out their dog for a night walk. He decides not to change Alice's suggested path and goes back to his dinner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once Alice gets home she sends a last notification to Bob thanking him for his watch. Bob sees Alice has arrived home safe while brushing his teeth, turns off his application and goes to sleep.
