                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to develop a satirical adventure game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walks through a series of self-contained mini-adventures that take jabs on various game titles.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used PowerPoint to 'code' and string together seamless animations, music, and sound effects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There was a lack of information on how to use PowerPoint to its potential.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized PowerPoint to a surprising extent.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to string various events in PP and how to work in a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Portal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing in the foreseeable future. We wouldn't want to rob sales from other companies thanks to our superb game.
