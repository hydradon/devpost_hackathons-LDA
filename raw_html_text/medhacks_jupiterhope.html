                    Many Syrian refugee camps are underserved when it comes to chronic-disease-management due to displacement or difficult circumstances. This includes a lack of access to care, resources, and technology to address their basic medical needs.

                    , was designed and developed to serve the existing gap between managing patient health and care-worker support systems. Community clinicians are trained, highly respected healthcare professionals in the camp community. Their high-education and respect among the community gives them a unique potential to serve as a communication point in the management of chronic diseases. Rather than focusing on each individual in need, we work on strengthening the health system as a whole.

                    Medical records are mostly kept on paper, which makes it difficult for physicians to efficiently manage displaced patients who may not have access to these records. However, Jupiter Health's unique patient-tracking features allow it to serve as a medium for health workers to monitor their patient's statuses remotely, which is sometimes the only way in a chaotic and constantly changing camp. It can also be used to schedule check-ups in-person directly between the clinician and the patient.

                    Lastly, the app offers a novel way of lowering the incidence and severity of chronic NCDs. We encourage healthy lifestyles by providing milestones and goals (such as step-count) for exercise and healthy eating. Long-term tracking features can allow for trend-analysis, such as the monitoring of AG1-levels in diabetic patients. The app offers points for "health-literacy"-based quizzes to educate them about their condition.
