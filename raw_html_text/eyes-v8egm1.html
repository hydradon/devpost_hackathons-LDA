                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We noticed there are no good applications that help blind people learn about their surroundings well. For example, Without the help of their families and friends, they even don't know what is in a photo they just shot.

                    This app provides a verbal description for all the pictures taken in the app.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js to build a web application server that accepts pictures and analyze the objects in them. To achieve this, we used Google cloud platform vision analysis API to analyze the objects inside the photos. Then we did a rhetorical analysis of all the words received and constructed a fluent sentence. We used Google Natural Language processing API to finish the analyzing works. After we constructed a sentence, we used ResponsiveVoice.js to trigger the phone speaker to read it.
