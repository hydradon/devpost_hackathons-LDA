                    Inspiration: An interactive way for making chores for your apartment a little bit easier.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Provides a progress bar for chores completed. Allows reminders to be sent to notify users to finish their chores.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We built a website with JAVASCRIPT, HTML, and CSS. And developed a prototype for an iOS app with proto.io. We utilized the various workshops throughout the day in order to build a tangible product for this hackathon.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: The main challenge was trying to understand the feasibility of our idea given our limited timeframe. We originally wanted to develop HomeSlice as an app. But we later decided to make a web page because it aligned more with our skillsets and due to time constraints. We still made a prototype of what we visioned for HomeSlice as an iOS app to present with.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: For most of us, this is one of the first hackathons we've ever been to. So we're really proud that we can walk out of here today with a tangible product and idea.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: So much!! But mostly about the importance of having a support group of mentors and friends cheering you on in your CS journey.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Homeslice: iOS app development and adding more features to expand the usability of this app.
