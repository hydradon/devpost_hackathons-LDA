                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration was taken from social media likes and dislikes app. This idea was turned into fake and real to make the app fun to compete for the fake news challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows you different news and you need to guess if the news is real or fake. Once you are done with it, you can generate some stats to help you see which areas you were weak at. In a way it helps you increase knowledge and makes you aware about a lot of trash news out there. It also has a virtual newspaper built in.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it in HTML, CSS and Javascript mainly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into multiplt challenges such as getting everyone on the same page with skills. Thinking about dividing the workload. We started with android development but it turned out to be highly ineffecient due to the amount of processing power it needed. Hence we started web development with my team mates learning we development from scratch.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the web app and the VR which was a bonus at the end of the day. The app works as we expected and shows out vision through this prototype.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt how to break a big task down into small chunks. If we go at a nice pace ticking the small chunks off then we can learn and build almost any during 24 hours. It's all about time management and persistence. I am really glad how my team stuck by despite all of us being strainger. It defintely improved out technical knowledge
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fun With News
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a fun app that can be used to educate people about the fake news that is out there. Awareness to such issue could help a lot in fighting this. If people are aware then they will think twice before beleiving to any news. This app will highlight the area they are a bit weak at when it comes to news. This can help them to watch out for fake news in those area. 
We also wanted to give a VR experience, starting with an idea of a room escape game where there are 3 news in every room and the user needs to guess if it's real or not. You need to be correct for atleast two news to escape that room. But due to limited time we ended up making a virtual newspaper where people read and try to differentiate between fake and real news.
