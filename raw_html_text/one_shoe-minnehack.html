                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people don't vote in elections despite their impact all aspects of civic life, especially at the local level. Even when people do go, there are often many candidates and elected positions that voters don't know anything about. We believe that being informed about candidates and being able to vote are critical to the social health of a community
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app connects helps voters find polling stations near them, as well as lists candidates who are up for election, and the office they are running for without requiring them to enter information on an outside site. This also pairs people who need a ride to a polling station with those who are able to assist and give rides.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used radar.io to set precincts as geofences. this allows us to determine which voting precinct a voter is in, and display other nearby districts. This let us match voters who were voting in the same precinct. The frontend was developed using the ionic web and app framework. A mysql database on google cloud held users, and information about voting precincts that included polling station, address, and candidates up for election at that precinct. this information was gathered form Minnesota secretary of state website using a web scraper.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    gauging the scope of our project, and what we could realistically finish was difficult for us. Also, deploying 10,000 files is apparently an issue.
