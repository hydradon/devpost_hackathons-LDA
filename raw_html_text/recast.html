                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by our own problems with video streaming services, including buffering, poor quality, and throttling by ISPs. We decided to build a solution for this issue by tackling video compression.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Recast intelligently compresses videos by learning encodings from real video data. This allows for more efficient video streaming and storage in any domain.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Recast using a Python backend, a React frontend, and AWS hosting. This included deep learning models trained with PyTorch, various AWS services, and a single page application built with React.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One primary challenge we faced was designing a deep learning architecture specifically for this task. We ended up using a convolutional auto-encoder trained on a specific loss function for this problem after some experimentation. We also ran into the challenge of setting up the whole cloud infrastructure in a limited time; luckily, we managed to build an entirely cloud-native application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our teammates, Lui, is a premed student and a Biochemistry major. He had no experience with computer science or programming whatsoever prior to this weekend&mdash; but he was able to build his very own React app and maintain a GitHub repository. In fact, three of our team members had never attended a hackathon before, but we still managed to achieve our targets for Recast.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it&rsquo;s possible to build a domain-specific video compression model that also generalizes quite well. We also learned the intricacies of bringing multiple services together in a cloud environment. The process of shifting from local to cloud-hosted applications presented itself with many integration and coordination considerations, and we were able to learn how to best architect cloud infrastructure for our needs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Recast
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Future goals for Recast are training on larger datasets to provide models with better generalization. We also want to test Recast in a variety of domains, including healthcare and education.
