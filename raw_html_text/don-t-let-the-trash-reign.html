                    Our Mission
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our intention is to provide an engaging way to learn in order to reinforce the message in a lighthearted, entertaining way.  By raising confidence is overall recycling quality, we can lift recycling bans and move towards a cleaner future
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it is
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Don't Let the Trash Reign is a game which encourages the user to make judgement on what is recycle-safe and what is not. The game discourages littering and excessive recycling of the incorrect items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Tools and Techniques
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a simple game building engine and used our creativity to make the most of its resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Obstacles
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally attempted to make an all powerful phone application, but with the lack of knowledge and resources, this proved to be impossible for our beginner team, thus we adapted our ideas into a much simpler platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to finish our very first hackathon with a completed and functioning demo product! We were able to form a completely new and original idea at a great disadvantage of time, but were still able to finish in record time. Since our backgrounds were so different, it was invigorating to find something we could come together on.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that any idea can be a good one, and that there are always ways to solve problems (we just have to persist and find the pesky bugs).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Next steps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we would improve the quality of the game by adding more recyclable and non-recyclable items, by making a more interactive interface which hints the players at mistakes in their decisions throughout the game and educates the player based on the choices made during the gameplay.  Additionally, more eyes mean more learning. Therefore, moving to as many platforms as possible. We would improve overall game playability, make it more user friendly.
Using positive reinforcement to encourage healthy recycling habits by having correct choices be worth more points
