                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My friend Steve spends money like it's nothing, but he's already in massive student debt. Who is this guy? Why did he fly to Atlanta? Please get him some help. We're here to guide him.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We present our customer's finance habits to them in more visual and personalized ways to enhance their financial literacy. For example, would you buy that Starbucks mocha-frappe-donut if you knew it was worth 16% of what should be your weekly savings? What if there was a constant visual reminder of the ways you are spending your money? The user is able to run a simulation of their future spendings as well as input their spendings as they happen. Based on the user inputs, the application would render visualizations of their trends and calculate suggested allowances/budgets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We separated into front end and back end teams. The back end was built using python/flask/SQL while the front end utilized Angular/Typescript/CSS/html.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Centering in on a purpose and point for our app was a rough one. We went through discussing a couple stages and ideas and came to finalize on a single concrete idea with 12 hours left.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FinLit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once everyone's holding on to their money again with the help of our app, we will then figure out a way to take it back away from them.
Idealy, we would like to extend FinLit so that each spendings do not have to be individually input by the users. We would also like to have this application on a mobile platform so it is more regularly interactive with today's users.
