                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have always had trouble scheduling events on calendars. We decided to create a bot to help us with our problem, and hopefully others as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ozzi is your personal scheduling assistant. She is a bot integrated in your Slack, Facebook Messenger, Skype, and other accounts to help you keep track of your events as well as remind you if some events are coming up. She will also help you schedule events without any hassle.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To create the bot, we used javaScript in Gupshup. To share the code with our teammates, we utilized codeShare. We referenced the documentation from the Gupshup website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to create variables to save dates, times, and titles, depending on the user's input.
Whenever we tested the button portion in Slack, it didn't exactly work. We later found out that those buttons don't function correctly, but operate well on Facebook Messenger.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we finished the bot, and work together to make it as successful as we could.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Receiving saved variables from the server.
Figuring the technology behind Gupshup and its code.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Ozzi Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like Ozzi to send reminders, let the user know if he/she ahs another event at the same time, and letting them change on the events. Later, we would like to have Ozzi manage other aspects in the user's life; sleep, nutrition, etc.
