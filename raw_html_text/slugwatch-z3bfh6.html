                    Many students have the problem of not being able to get into the class they want to because they fill up very quickly. Currently there exist solutions to this problem, but none at UCSC. In order to solve this problem we present an easy to use web application that allows students to keep a watchlist of classes and be notified when a spot opens up. They will also be provided with the appropriate information so that they can sign up very quickly.
