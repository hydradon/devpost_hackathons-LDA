                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personal currency conversion issues faced after flying to Canada from the US.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Allows a user to find the nearest ATM with the best exchange rate between two currencies, what the global rate is between two currencies, when the rate drops or increases between two currencies, and even reminds the user to trade some currency before going out of country (by reading their Google Calendar). This is all done intuitively over an intuitive text or voice interface on Google Assistant!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Mostly with Node.js, Dialogflow, and XE.com APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially had some issues getting the right response from XE.com APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating a bunch of different(, but related) and complex features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How the currency exchange space works.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Project Xeon
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More features! For example (but definitely not limited to): predicting how likely it is a given rate will go up or down in the next week using ML, helping you travel/spend abroad under a budget, and intelligently interpreting foreign purchases in your preferred currency.
