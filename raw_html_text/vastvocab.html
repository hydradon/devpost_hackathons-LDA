                    is important for everyone around the world, and is done daily, so I decided to come up with a site that teaches the user words to

                    is meant for anyone, from children to the elderly, and teaches them different vocabulary.  Currently, the set of words that were chosen are medical terminology that is essential to learn for medical students and doctors.  Vast Vocab will generate a new word every time you click the "generate new word" button.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Taking on this project by myself, there were many challenges that I ran into.  Considering that in the past, I had not had any experience with back-end development, this was a daunting task.  I had issues installing the
                    <strong>
                        PIP extension
                    </strong>
                    for Flask, which took up quite a few hours.  There was a constant error message returned even after properly installing PIP.  I eventually got around this issue by using a different editor (
                    <em>
                        pycharm
                    </em>
                    ), which was able to install PIP easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge that arose was
                    <strong>
                        integrating
                    </strong>
                    the returned
                    <strong>
                        Json data into Flask
                    </strong>
                    and displaying it on the screen.  After some help with student and sponsor mentorship, they resolved some of my issues, while also providing me with useful information as to what I should do next, to achieve my end goal.

                <p>
                    Considering that this was my first time using Flask and developing in the back-end, I am quite proud that I was able to eventually finish a
                    <strong>
                        working project
                    </strong>
                    , that successfully used
                    <strong>
                        API calls
                    </strong>
                    to retrieve the definition of randomly generated words.  At times within the hackathon, I was tempted to give up, but I decided not to and try my very best.

                <p>
                    I learned some fundamentals regarding back-end development, and how Flask uses
                    <strong>
                        pointers to call functions
                    </strong>
                    within Python when a certain route is triggered.  This being my first time working alone at a Hackathon, I've learnt that having teammates can be very helpful when distributing the workload, as it is a lot for one person.
