                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Strabismus (lazy-eye) in children can lead to permanent vision loss. Follow-ups are recommended at a frequency of 1 week per year of life (every 4 weeks for a 4 year-old) to track progression and treatment effectiveness. This costs parents time from work and money paid to clinics. This is especially taxing in countries such as Kenya, where the average travel time to the nearest clinic is 1.5 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thea is a mobile application for parents to monitor their child's strabismus progression by photographing their eyes, automatically analyzing alignment, and providing results to physicians. Thea replaces follow-ups, saving parents time and money while improving monitoring frequency. Imagine the difference between 6 and 2 annual follow-ups 30 minutes away with hour wait times.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Thea is built with a Python backend and a React-Native front end, wrapped in ExponentApp.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the algorithm to run fast has been a major issue I have been tackling. Also getting the algorithm to be accurate enough and consistent enough is also a problem. I am working on improving UI/UX.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Optimizing the algorithm for increased accuracy.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to load my code onto various hosts.

                    What's next for Thea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I want to take this forward and enroll in clinical trials to fully develop and launch the app to users.
