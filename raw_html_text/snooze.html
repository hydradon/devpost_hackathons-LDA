                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many people all across the globe that suffer from Sleep Apnea, a potentially serious sleep disorder wherein breathing repeatedly stops and starts. It is completely understandable as to why a solution is needed to remedy this problem and provide some sort of aid to those with sleep apnea. In addition, people may not realize that they have sleep apnea until it starts to affect their daily processes and their well-being. The goal of this design is to provide users with a simple and easy method for monitoring troublesome sleep patterns.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Snooze is a Hardware device that enables the user to remain informed about their sleep patterns and determine whether or not they have sleep apnea. This was mainly done using a raspberry pi, which would collect data from the MPU-6050 Gyro-Accelerator Sensor and the Sound Sensor. This data would go through our algorithm and from that the program would determine whether or not the individual is exhibiting troublesome sleeping patterns. The data is then web-hosted on to a server using Flask so that the data can be easily extracted by third-party services. We initially had the idea of making an app using Flutter, but due to time constraints, the UI and UX of the app were not made.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To retrieve sensor information we used an MPU-6050 Gyro Accelerometer Sensor, a Sound Sensor, and an Analog to Digital Converter. Through these sensors, data would be collected and it would run through our algorithm in order to determine whether or not the user is experiencing troublesome sleep. We also developed the program to incorporate a plotting function on the app, but due to time constraints, the front end of the app was not fully developed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Throughout the Hackathon, there were various challenges we ran into especially in regards to brainstorming an idea. Thankfully, we were able to work around our challenges and successfully complete a project we are proud of. Prior to coming up with Snooze, we came up with many ideas that were either too complex or had already been done. We also encountered challenges building the app portion of the project. Making an app was new to both of us, so there was a bit of a learning curve. In addition, using MQTT as a broker for the data and then creating widgets to effectively display the data was a big and timely challenge that we faced. After experimenting alot with the Flutter SDK and Android Studio, we were not able to complete the app but we were however able to learn a lot about a new program.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're definitely proud that we were able to successfully develop a project that provides relevant information to the user in a convenient manner. Our favorite part of the project is how we were able to seamlessly collect and analyze the data read from the sensors and host that on a web server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through our experience making this project, we learned how to work under a strict time constraint and create a relevant and applicable project. In addition, we learned how to work together with individuals at different skill levels and create an interdisciplinary application. Through this, we also gained exposure to app development, a relatively new concept for us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Snooze
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Going forth, we&rsquo;d like to continue adding new features to Snooze. Under the time constraints, we were not able to finish the actual app that would plot the data collected by the sensors, but we plan on implementing this feature in the future so that it is more convenient for them. We hope to publish this app to the Google Play Store and IOS App Store in the near future!
