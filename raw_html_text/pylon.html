                    Solutioner is a combination of Kickstarter, GoFundMe, and eBay. Using elements from all 3, Solutioner creates a market for Daugherty solutions to be created, sourced, and funded utilizing the vast experience of those just starting to those who are guiding its corporate direction. Creating a space where anyone can see their solutions come to life, be the one making it happen, or simply spur Daugherty to greater heights, Solutioner is a great way to make Daugherty be a place where all strengths can be shown and grown.

                    On one side of the application consultants can post their ideas, and other consultants can join a project if they're interested in working on it.

                <p>
                    On the other side of the application people can bid on projects in the "buy a feature" fashion, and invest in projects to help them succeed.

                    We saw three areas where growth is possible if given the right medium:

                <p>
                    The key to Solutioner is it's ability to have an
                    <strong>
                        idea
                    </strong>
                    quickly exposed to Daugherty internal for anyone to solve. Anyone can

                    , add
                    <strong>
                        incentives

                    ) or join in someone else's. Once a solution is kicked off (

                    </em>
                    ) the idea's requirements don't change and once the solution meets the requirements, the solution is
                    <em>

                    </em>

                    Adding Focus to the Growth
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One key to Solutioner is it's focus on encouraging solid definitions of what to solve. Accomplished by providing a space where requirements can be created before the project begins, Solutioner makes it easy for those with Ideas to define what they want created and those implementing the ideas to know what they are solving. After a purposal has been submitted and accepted, the requirements don't change making the goal clear and static.
