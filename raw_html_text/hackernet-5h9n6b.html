                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It seems every time I talk to my non-engineering friends about joining a hack-a-thon they give me a weird look and think I am doing something illegal like hacking into websites or something.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine the stereotypical indecipherable green 1's and 0's being printed to a terminal representing "Hacking data" that the media likes to show whenever they talk about illegal hacking. This program satirizes that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program randomly generates a "0" and "1" and then randomly chooses to generate a newline afterwards with probability 1/40.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By spending like 5 minutes programming it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into some small issues making the text green, so I had to download a library to do that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I can now fool my non-engineering friends into thinking that I am a top tier hacker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program did not fool anyone at Polyhacks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackerNet
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Run the program everytime at future Hack-A-Thons to show off my true Hacking Skills!
