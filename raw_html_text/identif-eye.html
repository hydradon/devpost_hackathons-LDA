                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to build a project that would use cutting edge technology to solve a societal issue.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app takes an image as input and detects whether there is a wanted person (whether it be a missing person or a runaway criminal) in the image. This would give more confidence to people who suspect that they are in proximity of a criminal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Software Face API to detect and identify faces in an image. The identification process is trained based on an existing database of wanted people. We then query the image to see whether we are confident that there is a wanted person in the photo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the AI frameworks were confusing at first.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of applying our technical abilities towards solving a societal problem that many face.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned Microsoft Azure and TKinter.

                <p>
                    Next step is getting a proper UI up and adding more data.
