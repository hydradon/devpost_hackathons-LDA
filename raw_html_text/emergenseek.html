                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Katie and Stephanie, two of our team members, are new Dentists with a lot of knowledge on various illnesses and symptoms, but little real world application knowledge. Having an app that would help bridge the gap between practical application and textbook processes would greatly benefit them,  and the many new dentists worldwide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Emergenseek consists of an Android app, an Alexa skill with hands-free features, and a simple Webpage outlining our features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Android App was built with Java, and the Android SDK, the Alexa Skill was built with Python, Flask-Ask, Amazon Alexa SDK, JSON, and the FDA database. The webpage was simply HTML/CSS
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Halfway through Saturday night, after a day of solid progress, our main Android developer had to leave the hackathon due to a family emergency. While we're extremely glad things turned out okay for him and his family, we (no experience with Android) had to finish off the app, and learn everything along the way. There were twists and turns, from figuring out the quirks of Android Studio and Gradle, to figuring out how to put our logo in the splash screen, we had to figure out everything along the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We went from no Android experience, to a functioning app, and also an Alexa skill and webpage. Additionally, for two of our members, it was their first hackathon, and creating these applications is extremely impressive for such little experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Organization is key, and clear communication has to be established for meaningful and efficient work to take place
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Emergenseek
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After HackNYU, we hope to fully flesh out all it's features, make an iOS version, have it on the play store, and ensure it's working for all our dentists properly
