                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Coming to a female hackathon, we were inspired to focus on empowering women in the workforce. Statistics tell us that the average wage of women is less than that of men. But we know, we deserve more than what the  society tell us!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our web application provides reliable statistics and data visualization of salaries of different occupations and of various age ranges of men and women.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a woman feels that her offered salary is not what she deserves, she can utilize negotiateHer to see what her skills are really worth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our application intelligently compares salaries with other individuals based on categories such as education, years of experience in the professional field, ethnicity/race, etc, and sees if the company is not offering her value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If she determines that she needs negotiation, she can also utilize our artificially intelligent negotiateHer to practice negotiating salary. Based on her speaking tone, eye contact, and facial expressions, our negotiateHer determines level of preparedness to pitch to her employer.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our team members did not have much experience with AI or using the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services API. We ran through many troubles trying to make requests to the API and understanding the examples. Using Node.js to make the backend work with very ugly functions within functions within functions was a pain.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not sleeping and powering through because we believe in this application.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using D3, unfamiliar APIs and incorporating Node.js backend and a lot of complicated JavaScript.
