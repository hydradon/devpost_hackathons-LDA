                    Fantasy sports, but with twitch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Essentially the idea is to play a fantasy football style game, using twitch streamers as the players and scoring points based on their viewership.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game utilises real life data to award points to users, and they earn money from matches they play against similarly ranked players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players are given a starting budget and can buy as many Twitch Streamers as they can afford, then using these streamers construct a team of 5 who will score points over the next 24 hours. The more 'Viewer Minutes' a twitch streamer gets throughout this 24 hours the more points the player scores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each game costs a portion of the value of your team with the winner of the game taking the pool.
