                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team has been willing and trying to find a unique and good idea for HackUMBC since last week, and we came up with the idea that can help us and many other developers to solve this problem.

                    Our web service helps to save time by entering the description of your idea once in our web search service rather than searching different combinations of phrases in various search places, like Google Play Store or App Store.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were building our web service by implementing JSON/Atom Custom Search API. We used data from that API to customize several searches.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we were challenged to implement JSON Custom Search API in our project, and the way our ready results were going to be presented
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We overcame all the challenges we faced and accomplished all our goals. We also spent a lot of time on designing the page, and writing the algorithms for customizing the search results.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the Google Search Engine API and enhanced our knowledge in front-end technologies.
                </p>

                    What's next for ConceptHunt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To begin with, to perfect our application by adding filters for scientific projects, businesses, and startups' ideas. To connect it with patent databases, and to use AI for recognizing the key phrases and improve the search results.
