                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to challenge myself by doing a hardware hack for this hackathon. A morse code decoder seemed simple enough for a beginnner like me to implement in a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses the button sensor to take in a series of dots or dashes. The touch sensor pushes the letter and each letter is attached to a string which is displayed on the LCD RGB Backlight. By snapping my fingers by the sound sensor, I can clean my message or hear it played back to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Arduino is not an object oriented language and I had to hardcode each morse code letter into individual strings rather than using a binary tree. This complication will vastly increase both the space and time complexity.

                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to build this program in such a short amount of time.

                <p>
                    I would like to add either a game functionality or a learning functionality to my decoder.
