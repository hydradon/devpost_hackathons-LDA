                <p>
                    Our institution - Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education provides IT training to large number of students. While within a classroom, a common problem about IT related lab activity is that, students usually focus on something that is not related to course (Browsing website, playing games or watching youTube videos). As lab exercise solution are being submitted in softcopy. Teaching staff is having a big headache on challenging students' plagiarism, as generally there is only one version of solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why we have built an opensource project &ldquo;Lab Monitor&rdquo; which uses AWS AI Services, serverless architecture, Amazon AR/VR services to enhance the learning experience and also gather data to understand what students/trainees are doing during lab/eTraining, and we want the project can be widely used not mainly for educational purpose but also applicable to all companies on eTraining session.

Then Teachers can have a nearly REAL-TIME view of all student activity to better manage the whole class.

                    By combining the power of each AWS Services, students will be encouraged to concentrate on their lab exercise and stop the dream of copying answer from others! Also, that will be much fun for them to work with Christine.

                    More than 4 months' effort has been paid off for this project and the development is still in progress. The current version aims for data collection and in future we plan to build machine learning model to predict users/students&rsquo; final grade against their class behaviour.
