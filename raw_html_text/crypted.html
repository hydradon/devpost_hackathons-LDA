                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just recently, we participated in a program where two of our mentors were unable to participate because they were undocumented immigrants and were terrified of being caught without id. We had never known that they were undocumented because they were just like other teens, but we never knew they constantly had to live their lives in fear. After learning of this, we wanted to solve some of the issues that these teens faced.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution is crypted, a healthcare app that connects undocumented immigrants with volunteers who provide them transport to healthcare facilities and resources.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our main app is built using html, css, and javascript. Our algorithm is built using java and google-maps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the beginning, most of the team didn't know how to build an app at all, but with the help of our mentor, we managed to build a full app based on html webpages.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        We made an app!
                    </strong>
                    Yay!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We deepened our understanding and knowledge of html, css, and javascript. It was actually very interesting learning just how difficult and tedious it is to build a full, aesthetic website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Crypted
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Moving forward, we plan to add several new features to help more people such as a map for easier interaction and increasing the number of medical facilities included our search. DACA girls deserve the same opportunities as anyone else and through Crypted, we will make this a reality.
