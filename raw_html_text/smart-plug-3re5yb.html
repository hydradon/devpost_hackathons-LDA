                    What it does

                <p>
                    Wirelessly control lights from a website, schedule when it turns on or off

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript front end, two Arduino Unos and an Arduino Uno WiFi, a relay, and rf transmitters and receivers. Signal from front end is sent to the Arduino Uno WiFi that then sends a signal through the rf transmitter to the rf receiver that then will turn a light on or off. This process can be scheduled or triggered manually through a site.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Each hardware part took some time to work out individually (relay, rf transmitter, rf receiver), as well as connecting the Arduino Uno WiFi to a website.
