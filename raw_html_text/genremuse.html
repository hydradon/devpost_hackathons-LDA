                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    People sometimes complain about music from certain genres always sounding the same, so I thought it'd be fun to test that and see if I could get a computer to take a genre, and sound "like every other song."
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, it can generate blues, jazz, and rock music, given certain specifications like tempo and key signature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I mainly used the JFugue library for its MIDI-controlling abilities.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    JFugue has awful documentation.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the music actually sounds good. Also, this is the first time I've really tried building a decently large project (it's also my first Hackathon), so that's always fun.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If I wanted to make this into a web app, Java was probably not the best language I could've picked. More seriously though, I learned a lot about how to just think through the design process and organize my thoughts before writing a single line of code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GenreMuse
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More genres! Also, I want to integrate more advanced music theory into the melodic line generation so that the music sounds more and more "human." In addition to that, I'm thinking about eventually turning it into a webapp that people can actually use to tinker with the instrumentation, mix genres, etc.
