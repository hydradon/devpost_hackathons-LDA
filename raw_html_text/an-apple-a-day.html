                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to make an apple a day by seeing our friends at school making unhealthy food choices. By creating this app, we hope to help others make healthy choices when it comes to nutrition. We hope the points act as a good incentive for people to make healthy food choices. We also want to educate people about food, nutrition, and health.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    an apple a day allows the user to search through thousands of food items. Each food item is rated on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being the best and 10 being the worst, based on its nutrition value. A card on the site then displays the food item, in addition to being able to keep track of all of your food items and the average nutritional score of the accumulated food items.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made the landing and dashboard pages with HTML and CSS. We gathered all the data about the food products using data from the Environmental Working Group and the Python library scrapy to get all the information off the website since they did not offer it in a database or API format. In total, we gathered more than 100,000 food products and their ingredients, calorie counts, serving size, and overall the EWG's Food Score that weighs all the benefits and negatives of the food. We used Flask as the webserver to create an easy searching and tracking experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had some trouble with the styling of the website. Another challenge was that we had a hard time using scrapy to gather all the information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the final look of our website. We are also proud of gathering more than 100,000 food products and displaying them in a way that is clear to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use scrapy and how to better use styling to make our websites look better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for an apple a day
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to make an apple a day into a full-fledged web app that allows users to have their own account. The users can collect points based on the nutrition value of the food product. There will be a leaderboard where it will display the users with the highest points.
