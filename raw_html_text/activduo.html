                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After learning about activbody's products and their mission, our team was inspired to expand their capabilities by innovating how their products could be incorporated into users' daily lives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The activduo project introduces a two part service: the activglov and the duo service. The activglov uses force sensors to track physical activity. The duo service allows for the use of multiple devices and platforms to interact with the activglov.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used figma, photoshop, and invision software to create prototypes that best represented our expectations for this product.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since our team collectively had limited knowledge on hackathons, from programming to the rules and expectations, we found ourselves doing more research rather than developing our ideas into a presentable demonstration. In addition, there were many times when we found ourselves going too far off tangent from our main idea. This caused us to think too far ahead of ourselves, which hindered us from staying focused on our product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite running into multiple obstacles, we are proud of the concept that we came up with and how we furthered the possible expansions for activbody.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that to succeed, although being creative and coming up with endless amounts of ideas is important, it is paramount to focus on one idea at a time. Throughout this hackathon, there were many times we learned how to best apply our skills, especially under pressure.
                </p>

                    What's next for activduo
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to see its implementation in the real world.
