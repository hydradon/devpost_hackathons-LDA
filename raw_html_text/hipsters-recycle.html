                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the hacking challenges was a no coding hack. This had the team brainstorm ideas using the objects we had around us.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows to have a low cost and recycled lantern. It's meant to hold a tea light or candle. It's base is large enough to catch wax.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We took the cans from the hackathon and used a knife to cut the can into strips. Once cut we bent and straightened the can to form the lantern shape. We used a rubberband from the shirts that were given to us during the hackathon as a hanging mechanism.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to cut into the can at first. The technique wasn't perfect because some of the strips came out jagged.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having no time to prep or any materials the team was proud of how the final product turned out. In the end we had fun and wanted to see just how far we could go with so little material.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    That art can come from anything and it can also be usable. It's amazing when you take away the coding part to a project what can come from it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hipsters Recycle
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make more and improve technique! In the future if this was repeated it would be interesting to see what would come out if we had time to plan and prep with more material/tools.
