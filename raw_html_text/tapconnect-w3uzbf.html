                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it easier for people who meet for the first time to connect. We were inspired to act because of the inconvenience of pulling out your phone and entering contact information manually.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is currently hardcoded, but will eventually use NFC technology to allow users to connect with each other by simply tapping their phones together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using Android Studio and Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Challenges we ran into include using the NFC API, because it is much more complicated than it seems. This is actually the reason we were forced to hardcode the app, even though we got the NFC connection working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that we are proud of including getting the NFC connection working and almost succeeded in accomplishing something that requires much more knowledge than we currently have. In addition, we will extend this app to use NFC technology to link people through social media platforms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using Android Studio (since most of us had no experience in Android programming). In addition, we learned about the benefits that sometimes come from failure. We will use what we have learned to improve this app for the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TapConnect
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next, we plan to use NFC technology to automate the process of linking clients on social media platforms. This will make life much easier for millions of people looking to build social and business connections.
