                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you see a good deal, you might not have enough people to take advantage of the deal. See a buy-one-get-one-free? Chances are, you don't want to carry around two of that item. Instead, this app lets you share the deal with others in the area to allow everyone to benefit and connect with popup deals.

                <p>
                    Good deals aren't planned -- they're discovered as you explore. No matter who you have with you, DealBreaker lets you find and share deals as they appear, with anyone in your area.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was built with Node.js, with all data persisted to Firebase. Social authentication was also done through Firebase's API. The web front-end was built with VueJS, and the Android app with Android Studio. Location visualization was done with Google Maps, and locality algorithms were developed during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting set up with all the technologies involved was time-consuming. For a period in the middle of the hackathon, individual development of the various modules progressed fairly well, but when it came time to integrate them at the end, we ran into many more challenges, mostly around the API communicating with the various front-end agents.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When everything actually worked, it was a prize to behold.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how aspects of front-end and back-end work in diverse circumstances. This was also our first time working with the Google Maps API and location data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DealBreaker
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to better integrate user data into the app, allowing for more user control. We'd also like to add more of a personal touch by including more information about individuals who joined certain groups. We could also expand the number of search filters available to users.
