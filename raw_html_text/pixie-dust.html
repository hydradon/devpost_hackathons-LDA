## Challenges I ran into

                    <li>
                        Most of us didn't know how to code, so we had to learn HTML, Javascript, and CSS before making it work.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We made our basic foundation work!!! And our presentation is really cool.

                    <li>
                        We learned HTML, CSS etc, how to link pages of the website, and more
