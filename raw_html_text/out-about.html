                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to find ways to help people stay safe on nights out.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users can create groups on the app that their friends can join. The app will plot each group member's location on a map that anyone in the group can view. If someone is getting suspiciously far from the group, an alert will be sent to the members to check on this person. 
Users can also keep track of their alcohol intake during the night by logging a drink or shot on the app whenever they have one. If it seems like the person is drinking too much, all of their group members will be notified. This way, they can check and make sure the person is doing okay.
There is also a panic button on the app that any user can hit. Hitting the panic button sends an alarm to all of the group members to let them know their friend is in trouble.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The front end was built on Android Studios using the Volley API to connect to the server. The server was written in Java using the Spring framework and hosted on Amazon Web Services. Data is stored in a MySQL database.

                    What's next for out+about
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to add an ability for a user to join the group as an 'observer'. This could be a friend staying in for the night that is willing to check in on the group every now and then, who is also readily available in emergencies.
                    <br>
                    It would also be nice to add a feature that automatically detects when you are in the location you have set as 'home', and sends a notification to your group members that you made it back safely.
