                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use JIRA workflows heavily for most of our projects, but sometimes you just have a need to visualize things in a different way, and track issues based on some other rules. Whether it's issues you personally want to track follow ups on, or organize a weekly schedule, or anything else really. Trello handles this nicely with boards that allow arbitrary columns based on your own definitions. We wanted something similar, but with the power of JIRA behind it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It allows you to create boards with an arbitrary set of columns, labeled however you want, so you can arrange and track issues based on your own needs. Arranging issues on a board is a simple drag and drop operation, and is not restricted by any workflow rules or transitions that JIRA Agile would enforce, thus granting you more flexibility.
                </p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    with the atlassian-connect sdk, reactjs on the UI, and firebase for data synchronization.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    integration with firebase and keeping the data in sync was interesting to solve.
