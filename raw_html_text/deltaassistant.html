                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an environment and perception that flying is easy, fun, and not a hassle. We wanted to amplify the positives of flying while trying to mitigate and/or remove the hassles and stresses of flying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is an app which is a hub for all one's flight information, planning of flights, tickets, maps of the airports, and a chat bot which allows you to ask questions about flying in general, as well as finding locations on your route to your gate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using the Ionic Framework to take our web app (JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3) and compile it down into code that can run natively on both iOS and Android.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into is the implementation of Microsoft&rsquo;s Text Translation API with the Chat Bot framework.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the fact that this application has the opportunity to make travel a more enjoyable experience, and the fact that as a team we were able to learn and implement new technologies this weekend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the process in which businesses and products are developed, different technologies and frameworks, and have tried many different things that may have failed or succeeded, to bring us closer to our finished product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Delta Assist
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next for Delta Assist is creating a bot that can speak and interact in multiple language, and in app camera which can translate signs into one&rsquo;s native tongue, and maps which draw lines from your current position to your gate, a restaurant, or a store. Also we want to attempt to use some of the other APIs we learned about this weekend (specifically NCR's loyalty API), which will allow Delta to better serve their high value customers (HVCs).
