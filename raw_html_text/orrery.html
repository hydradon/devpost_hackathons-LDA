                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this app was to create an app that overlays star data and constellations in virtual reality, in order to create a unique user experience.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the camera, it detects star information
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend uses Java and OpenCV for star detection from camera. We wrote an algorithm from scratch and used machine learning to train the data in order to detect star information from images of stars. The frontend is an Android app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, we tried using ENCOG library for machine learning, and used EC2 instances to train our data, but because we were writing the machine learning part without using a machine learning API and training it ourselves, we kept running out of RAM and had limited system resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially we wanted to display the constellation star data on the hololens, but we could not figure out Unity in time as it took a long time to install along with Visual Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend to detect star data was completed relatively quickly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about using new technologies--such as hololens.

                    What's next for Orrery
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More resources to train machine learning algorithm.
