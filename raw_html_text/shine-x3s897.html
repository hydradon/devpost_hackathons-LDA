                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Shopify's Unicorn system, an internal and social platform to share what good things fellow employees have done, how they went above and beyond for the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of each month, Shopify puts a fraction of the profits into the system, disbursing real payouts to each employee, according to an algorithm that rewards both posters, voters and recipients of posts..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It uses Tor.us to provide crazy easy onboarding, and shows the posts in your company (saved on a backend), and allows users to create posts, and vote on posts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The management of your company (or some anonymous donor!) can then send money to the contract and disburse payouts, 95% to those "shined", 5% to those who "shined" another one, and 5% for those who up-voted those posts, for a great total of 105%. We love it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used dfuse.io's recently released Ethereum service to stream all the data to the UIs. We used tor.us to quickly onboard new users, and vote for them, and shine them even though they haven't gotten their private key yet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gas management, picking up front-end skills,
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Full e2e integration, with good design, not shy to push that to production with a few fixes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learned about the Tor.us APIs and features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Shine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wrap it up, and deploy it on our Intranet.. we've been long awaiting such a system.
