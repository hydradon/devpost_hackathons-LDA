                    It started with the silly games that children - and certain goofy MIT students - play while pretending to talk on the phone. With a thumb to the ear and a pinkie finger to the mouth, there was our very own cell-phone, one that every human being with enough imagination has. And yet, what if we actually could talk through our hands? First came the smart phone. Then the smart watch. But what's next? We believe the SmartGlove is next.

                    Equipped with an LED clock face, vibrating motor, button, and Bluetooth module on the left hand, and a speaker, microphone, and vibrating motor on the right, the SmartGlove has great potential. Currently, the press of a button gives the user the time of day on their left hand. Users can program for vibrations in either hand to act as indicators for certain events. A speaker in the thumb plays sound at normal phone call volume.

                    The SmartGlove consists of a leather glove installed with all electronic devices as listed above, with an Arduino Micro and Arduino Bluetooth module located at the wrist. A battery pack on the right can power the Arduino. Using Microsoft's Visual Studio

                    Excluding the difficulties of soldering electrical components into the highly-flamable insulation of the glove, we initially struggled with linking the Bluetooth module with the operating computer. Eventually, we had to suffice without Bluetooth, but we learnt a great deal about Bluetooth for future continuation of our efforts. Furthermore, storing large amounts of sound data on a small amount of RAM proved a great trouble. However, we were proud to fully implement all hardware we intended on using, and especially managed to complete communication between all modules.

                    Especially for bikers or pedestrians on a cold windy day, taking out one's phone to check the time, receive calls, or look at a GPS can be inconvenient. But with the SmartGlove, one can check the time simply by looking at the back of their left hand; they can recieve calls straight through a speaker in their right thumb and microphone in the pinkie; they can even be notified of the next turn they should take by vibrations in either hand. By linking the SmartGlove to the users' phone via Bluetooth, the user can even talk to Siri or Cortana for a greater variety of functions.
