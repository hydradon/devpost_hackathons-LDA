                </h2>
                <p>
                    The #DeFi movement is rapidly growing into a global financial ecosystem.
One of the key players in this field is MakerDAO.
MakerDAO users lock up ETH in a smart contract and withdraw DAI stablecoin.
This debt is over-collateralized: the value of the Ether locked must exceed the value of the DAI withdrawn with the ratio of at least 1.5.
If it drops below 1.5, the position is liquidated, i.e., the DAI are forcibly returned to the contract, and the (now cheap) Ethers returned to the user, minus the liquidation fee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To avoid liquidation, users either increase the collateral (ETH) or decrease the debt (DAI).
This moves the position further from the liquidation threshold and makes the CDP "safer".
                </p>
                <p>
                    We identified a problem for Maker CDP holders: to react quickly in the case of rapid market movements, the user must be constantly online.
No existing DeFi project addresses this issue.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DAI Insured enables a CDP holder to outsource the monitoring and (partially) repaying CDPs to avoid liquidation.
This outsourcing is performed trustlessly and increases market efficiency by enabling markets for CDP monitoring.
When called, DAI Insured decreases the liquidation risk by decreasing the collaterization and debt by the same amount.
With DAI Insure, a user may be sure that their CDP won't be liquidated.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Two ways to avoid liquidation
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We can visualize a CDP as a point on a plane, where the X axis is the collateral value (deposited ETH in USD), and the Y axis is the debt value (withdrawn DAI in USD).
Our goal is to always stay under the Liquidation (red) line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The black line us is the insurance threshold line.
In the area between these lines (the Danger Area), our contract may act to move the point further from the line.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    This can be done in one of the two ways:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        move down and then left
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        move left and then down
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Let's call our CDP holder Alice.
Let's denote our contract as the Saver.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Down then left
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Saver identifies a CDP in the Danger Area, it does the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        transfer DAI to close (part of) Alice's debt
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        wipe these DAI and get ETH in the Maker contract
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        sell ETH
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The drawback of this method is that the Saver has to have some capital (in form of DAI) upfront to partially repay the CDP.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Left then down
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Another way would be to:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        take some ETH from the collateral
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        sell ETH for DAI (e.g., at Uniswap)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        wipe the DAI in the Maker contract
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The benefit is that no capital is required upfront.
The drawback is that one such "step" may not be enough to move out of the Danger Area.
In the CDP is close to liquidation, only a small amount of ETH can be withdrawn on step 1.
In this case, multiple steps are required to leave the Danger Area.
As a result, the transaction fees will be higher.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a contract to operate the CDP.
This contract helps partially repay the debt to increase collaterization ratio of any CDP that is close to liquidation.
This feature can be attached to any existing CDP and doesn't break existing integrations.

You should find someone who already knows the contracts before digging into it.

This would allow the Saver to operate in a single step without requiring additional capital, bypassing the collaterization ratio requirements.
