                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an app that makes it easier to let your friends know what you're doing and what events matter to you! Start sending voos today!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rendezvous is a calendar app that allows you to create and import custom stickers into snapchat based on events that you have made in your calendar. Stickers are unique based on the type of event you are making and can be added to snaps and stories. We have a lot of ideas for scaling this app with a long-term development plan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built our app using Swift and did some of the image processing scripts in Python to generate assets. We first created a baseline calendar application and then added events that can be placed on each day. When an event is created, the user can tap on it and they will be taken to snapchat with the new sticker. These stickers are visible to all users and can be manipulated like any other sticker in the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to learn Swift and Xcode from the ground-up. None of us have experience with app development so we definitely learned a lot. At one point we even lost nearly all of our work and had to restart but we persevered.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we got it our app to a functional state and that we did not give up even though there were moments that we definitely wanted to. We believe in Rendezvous and it being something that a lot of users find helpful!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about perseverance and each other throughout. We learned so much about app development, particularly Swift and the Xcode IDE!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Rendezvous
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rendezvous is an app that is meant to make the lives of its users easier! We have a lot of ideas for scaling this app with a long-term development plan. We wish to add the ability to create events, add primary contacts for events, and add push notifications.
