                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Low income artisans are giving their best and still not getting paid, while they are contributing a lot in our culture. Their handicrafts etc are way too important to preserve our culture etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saqaf is a platform for this type of artisans where we help these artisans to earn what they deserve by selling their cultural products to foreign countries. At start saqaf is targeting only selected products from peshawar and expected to grow to target more products from different areas of pakistan.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a website for customers and also an android application for them.  Android application is created on android studio while website was made on Wordpress platform.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Saqaf ran into many challenges like encouraging artisans to come and make products for us instead of local market only and have faith on our system. But we were able to convince few artisans at start.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We sold few caps in USA made by a local pakistani lady on a trip there and also convinced a few new artisans to come and work with us .
                </p>
                <h2>
