                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With every other game I have played, I only control a character in a pre-set environment. I wanted to create a game where you could control both the player and the environment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    you play as a spaceship traveling through space. you cannot control the movements of the spaceship, but you can still shoot at approaching comets and spinning vortexes. Swipe away asteroids and align passageways of walls of fire to make progress through space. Last in space for as long as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this game using the SpriteKit mobile gaming engine provided in Swift.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this was my first app, I had several issues with syntax, logic, setting up the structure of the code, and art assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I was able to create my own game based on ideas that I had for it, and I am now able to share this concept with the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this process, I became aware of how communities of programmers coming from all walks of life were able to help each other accomlish certain tasks both online and in person, and become a better programmer overall.
