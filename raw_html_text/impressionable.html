                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our members, Shayla, has experience in hosting formal recruiting events, and has had difficulty in remembering all of the qualified candidates she had networked with. This gave rise to an application that provides more objective and comprehensive data to discuss when furthering members to their next stages of recruitment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Upon registering for our web app a recruiter fills in 5 key attributes that they look for in a candidate. Upon submission, program will generate a a session code that they can send out to potential candidates. Candidates will join session and fill out basic information such as (Name, program, and GPA).
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the day of the event, the recruiters will be able to log into our android app and access a list of their potential candidates. During the networking session or directly after they will be able to submit a vote by quickly selecting which of their key pre-selected attributes each candidate possessed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web application was built in Javascript with Angular I on the front-end and Node on the back-end. The mobile application was built in Java using Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The web application is meant to be converted to an electron application using Electron, but a final executable version is not available due to time constraints (instead, we simply point localhost to the program's html document).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we had issues combining the two together on a cloud-based service that would transport JSON data between the web and mobile app. The web app worked using Dropbox's API; however, we were not successful with doing the same on Java.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For all of us, this is the first foray into back-end programming that we have undertaken, so seeing some degree of success is elating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since this is the first hackathon three of the four of us have ever attended, we have learned to coordinate on a group to design the architecture for a large program that runs in hundreds of lines, and build it in a collaborative environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We all brought very different skill sets to the team, and learning how to utilize everybody's strengths was a significant milestone in Hack Western for us.
                </p>
