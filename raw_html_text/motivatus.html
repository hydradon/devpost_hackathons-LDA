                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were furious with ourselves and we saw the lack of interaction between teachers and students.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    MotivatUs allows students to post work that they have to do and if they complete it, it allows people to receive notifications and they congratulate them, but if they don't complete it, it allows them to see it but everybody knows you didn't do your work, so if you didn't do your work that leads to less procrastination.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML to frame the basic website. We used CSS to make it pretty. We used JavaScript to prompt the users to sign up or sign in. We also included Twitter API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the API's were working with the key that was given.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Working together effectively as a team. Creating buttons that go to different screens and using Twitter API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use API's and we learned how to use GitHub. We also learned how to work better as a team.
                </p>
