                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Institution led us to the idea that it will be fun to listen to the voice of ordinary things.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app changes photos of your real stuff into an instrument with sounds based on the characteristic (color, shape, etc.). You can enjoy creating music by these instruments with your friends. You can also mix those instruments to generate a new instrument and its sound and they are stored in eluvio content space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We only a new music generation method but also gives your goods new value.
We&rsquo;re happy if this app gives new value to ordinary things.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created (though some parts are in WIP) this by Unity, OpenCV, and eluvio.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was my first project on Ethereum and eluv.io though I had some experience in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Monacoin (first altcoin in Japan) so I had to start from learning how to use those technologies and libraries.
