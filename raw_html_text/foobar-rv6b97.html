                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were initially trying to play the game and hit as many requirements for the opt-in prizes as possible. We then realized we just wanted to enjoy the experience, so we started brainstorming about possible app ideas. We realized that the process for deciding where to eat with your friends was in great need of revamping. We knew how intuitive Tinder's card based interface was to use, so we used this to gain inspiration towards our app's layout.
