                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Millennials do not care about owning music, they just want to access, listen, and share it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User can play, choose and share music with voice commands from anywhere in a room by requesting that 'Alexa' (Amazon voice assistant) find and play music.  Stop music, find new music or find a particular song.
By adding the user cell phone we can track the user location to where to best play music. As the user moves from room to room, the music will follow the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend is two nodejs servers talking to each other over PubNub.  One server runs on AWS and handles request from 'Alexa'.  The other sends commands to the speakers and communicates with the music services.  Volume of the speakers changes as the user moves from room to room near each new set of speakers.
On the Android phone we use standard android BLE commands to track BLE mac address sent by a ble tag placed by each speaker. By carefully converting RSSI to a rough distance we can set the volume automagically as the user gets close to each speaker. The phone sends data to the server using a standard http put.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Music service apis, debugging the headless interface.  TrackerR tags needed a lot of work to dial them into precise uses.  Debugging BLEs was difficult. BLE RSSI does not map into distace.
