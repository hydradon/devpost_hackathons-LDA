                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make an interactive program using the Myo and the Oculus Rift to help people practice writing syllabary, however we ran into some shortcomings.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wound up making a program that allowed users to draw using the Myo.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Unity game engine with the Myo assets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to use 3D movement to maneuver a box around a 2D space. Coming up with a system that allowed users to turn drawing on and off using one of the built in Myo gestures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get the maneuvering working after awhile.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot about the Unity engine and about motion capture from working with the Myo.
                </p>

                    What's next for Interactive Motion Capture Paint Application
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue working on it to see if the original goal could be achieved.
