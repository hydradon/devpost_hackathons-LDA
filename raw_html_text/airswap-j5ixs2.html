                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration came from the actual journey we had to make to HackUPC. We flew in with Ryanair as per usual, most of the people were not happy with their randomly allocated seats, resulting in a massive delay and a lot of unnecessary fuss. Airswap is our solution to this ever occurring problem, helping people flying in the world.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Airswap allows unhappy customers to register their already booked seats and get new, better seat allocations on their flight before they even board.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The core logic is based on advanced mathematical analysis of seat allocation including, for example, partitioning and bijective mapping between the physical and virtual space. We have used dynamic web application technologies in order to construct the user interface in order to make the allocation process as simple as possible for the user.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though the algorithm to calculate the best allocations seemed daunting to start with, we have ultimately managed to tackle the problem and create an efficient solution, including a formal proof for its optimality.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of our algorithm of seats shuffling. It works even better than human thinking!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how useful were the algorithms &amp; maths classes from high school. In addition, it also became evident to us how real-world problems can be solved by the application of technology.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Airswap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to have a better user interface and promote it to people who need it as we believe it can really save a ton of time and pain that come with flying.
