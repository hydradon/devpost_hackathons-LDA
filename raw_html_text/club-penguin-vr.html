                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something fun and innovative with futuristic technologies using an old classic game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Club Penguin VR brings you the classic experience of selecting your penguin, walking through a charming town, and dancing in the nightclub! We used computer vision so that your penguin actually does your dance moves, and there's a giant mirror in the club room for you to watch yourself jam out on the colorful dance floor while surrounded with fellow penguins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Unity as the game engine, C# to code, Google Daydream as the VR device, Blender to model the buildings and rig the penguins, and TensorFlow and OpenCV and Python to build the computer vision model.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were unable to find a teammate with prior experience with computer vision, so we had to learn and create it, which was a long process. We also had to build many of our own 3D models for the game. Linking a deployed VR android app with Firebase while recording your body movements for the dancing was also something we had to design around.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to do some justice to the old classic game, now including the ability to dance your own dances. The penguin had a slightly different rigging structure than a humanoid, but we were able to map to the best of our abilities during the hackathon our movements and joints to those of the penguin. It's quite fun to watch your penguin dance your dance!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Club Penguin VR
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uh, yea, make all of Club penguin of course. Snow ball fights and the mine cart race! We originally wanted to also do the minecart race by computer vision, watching for body tilting. However, we ran out of time to model the entire track.
