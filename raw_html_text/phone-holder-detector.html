                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running out of time with no other tangible products, I decided to play around with the Android API and learn about the different sensors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using accelermeter and gyroscope, I attempt to figure out whether the phone is currently being held/carried or resting still.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Android API and nothing else.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing (yet). At first only the gyro was working (still have to fix that)
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I managed to learn Android Development, a long-term goal of mine that I had never gotten around to
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Development
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Phone Holder Detector
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More features! I would love to integrate the camera into this somehow.
