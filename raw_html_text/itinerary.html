                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the idea for Itinerary because we travel often and we found we usually spent a lot of time on planning the itinerary. Even though there are so many websites for searching hotels or flights, there is basically no website that will automatically generate itinerary  for travelers. Thus, we believe this will be a useful tool for travelers!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://itinerary.azurewebsites.net" rel="nofollow">
                        It automatically generates an itinerary for travelers
                    </a>
                    . After entering a destination, budget, and duration, the web app will automatically generate the best attractions they should visit and the best hotels to stay within their budget.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Javascript and HTML/CSS to build the website. We used the Google Places API to gather information on attractions and hotels and built out internal algorithm to plan an optimal vacation that visits all of the most prominent attractions and puts the user in the best hotel under budget.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Navigating API and finding appropriate API are the first few challenges we met. Since we allow users to impose both cost and time restrictions, the development of the algorithm also took a lot of discussion!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The computation and automation process is faster than we believed possible and we were able to deliver our core value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, basic assumptions are necessary to make things work and build a basic model, and we were forced to confront that in building a functional project with the limited nature of the resources available to us. Additionally, we gained major experience building a dynamic website using Javascript and interacting with web APIs to build a web app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Itinerary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We believe local events are also a key component for travelers' plans, and we will include recommended events during the traveling dates in our next step. We didn't include it in this version mostly due to the limitations of Eventbrite's/Ticketmaster's API. The hotel recommendation will also be improved if we get access to Expedia's API, which was not available this weekend, while our attraction recommendations would be refined by access to the TripAdvisor API .
