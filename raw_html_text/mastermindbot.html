                            What was the hardest part?
Learning how genetic algorithms works and coming up with a solution for resolving the mastermind game using it.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
Don't try to find pre-made solutions using ga, give yourself time to properly learn and then apply it.

                            If you could change something about this challenge, what would it be? 
The challenge was really fun to figuring out, I think it's great! Maybe I would decouple it from the chat part, but that all makes sense when looking to the three challenges all together.
