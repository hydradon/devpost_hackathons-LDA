                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The world of finance changes rapidly and can be very intimidating to the layman. Having faced the difficulties with sudden prices changes, etc, we sought a way to make it easier for people to analyze the market and communicate with their broker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    VisioStock allows people to view market data in direct relation to industry competitors and also set particular threshold values for each stock. This allows people to see market changes may influence their stock prices. Having the threshold values allows users to be notified when those values are passed, so that they can immediately take action and not fall behind on the market and potentially lose money. We allow direct connection to stock brokers through the app, removing the need for people to constantly be monitoring their stocks. In addition, we use the Marquee API to retrieve data on future value indicators of stocks, so that people are informed of how to set their threshold values.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app was primarily built using react-native, python, and flask. We also utilized the iexFinance API to receive current market statistics and the Marquee API to provide stock value information. Finally, we used Twilio to automate calls, texts, and messages between broker and buyer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We first attempted to write the front-end of our application in Swift, but ran into many issues after the back-end was finished. We then switched to react-native, and had to essentially restart our front-end, which put us in a time crunch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never done a finance based application before and thus navigating through the iexFinance API and the Marquee API was difficult. However, it was cool to learn about this new area of technology and engineering and we hope to use these skills later. We are also proud of the use of Twilio as it is really able to automate many of our processes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of how to interpret and financial data in order to present it in a succinct way. In addition, we use flask and python for our back-end which was good exposure to another language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we hope to add even more information and stock value indicators to keep people more informed and allow them more options for how to be alerted after changes in the market.
