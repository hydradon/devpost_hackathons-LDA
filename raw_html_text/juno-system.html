                        People suffering from dementia face a number of problems on a daily basis:
  Memory loss/difficulties in planning and performing easy tasks
  Communication problems
  Confusion about time and place
-JUNO, greek goddess and protector of the state.
-JUNO system made to help people suffering from dementia perform their routine and stay safe
-Allows family members to track them in real-time and remotely
-Send someone to pick them up in case they leave the perimeter and are disoriented
-This person needs to register on a webpage and have training in how to deal with dementia.
-When registering the patient, a video is previously uploaded by the guardian to be shown during pick-up (familiar faces makes it easier to interact)

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Uses a Fitbit IONIC with in-built GPS
-Webpage to update the guardian about their position
-Alerts when they leave a pre-set perimeter (Using Node-RED)
-Monitor heart rate and send alerts if it goes under or above the threshold
-Voice notifications to remind the patient to perform everyday actions (take pills, have lunch, etc.)
-Notifications will be pre-recorded by a family member not to scare the concerned person
                </p>

                    Design and Layout
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -Fitbit studio to create a Fitbit app for geolocation/reminders
-Python to create the webpage:
&ldquo;Create an account&rdquo; page (both for patient and person picking them up)
Map showing their position and the pre-set perimeter for the guardian
-Heart Rate monitor
-Notifications and alerts about patient activities ( movement, reminders, etc.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    our project was quite ambitious in such a short amount of time and we have never used a Fitbit before, so it was quite difficult to make a start. moreover, we lost some time trying to make the inbuilt GPS start working. when trying to perform geofencing, we had a hard time setting the perimeter.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    even though we haven't done that much of what we were planning we, however, managed to get geolocation and coordinates data extracted continuously.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    in the end, we learned a lot on how to work under pressure, a tight time frame but also about coding and programming as we had different knowledge in the field (we knew different languages) and managed to all work together and bring different things to the table. HackMed was a great experience which definitely is helpful as engineers and prepare us for the future ( we also had a lot of fun being part of it!!!)
