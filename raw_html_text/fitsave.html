                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Motivating people to exercise is difficult. People fall into a vicious loop of downloading fitness apps but not following through with their commitment because of a lack of incentive within the apps. Our app uses a reward system based on discounts for healthy products to promote more healthy lifestyles.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift to build the front-end of the app, and Firebase for the back-end database. We used the iOS HealthKit SDK to read the data necessary to calculate fitness points, and various libraries to construct the user interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the HealthKit SDK to the app was a challenge due to complications in our developer account settings. We also faced some issues with designing the interface of the app, as we decided to create everything programmatically.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning how to make an iOS app without storyboarding, integrating Apple SDKs into app features
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to gain more experience with iOS development, and that asking people for help as well as being self-directed learners are both extremely beneficial.
