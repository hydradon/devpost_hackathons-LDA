                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As college students in the modern day we often have trouble figuring out what common social media and messaging apps we share. This especially becomes an issue when forming large groups and if someone incorrectly writes down someones contact info. We wanted to make getting other people's contact information and finding a common messaging or social platform easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a proof of concept for a new feature to be implemented in the Contact apps of standard smartphones. We make it so each person builds their contact profile for themselves containing every social media or messaging platform they use as well as their username on that platform. We then use a QR encoder to put all of that information into a QR code that can be scanned by other people to instantly make a contact for that person in their phone. We also wanted to create a group building function that would let you know what platforms everyone shares and should use for group communication to make staying in contact easier.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it by creating a sqlite database to store all of an individuals contacts. We then interfaced it with a GUI made in java to demo how it would work in a phone app. We used online libraries for encoding and decoding QR codes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to make an actual Android app that could scan QR codes, however we spent several hours unsuccessfully trying to get the Android SDK to work and decided to just go with a mock-up desktop application instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of figuring out how to implement QR encoding and decoding within our program as none of us had any previous experience with scanning in images in Java and interpreting them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had one group member with not a lot of previous coding experience that was able to learn the basics on java and SQL programming. We also learning a lot more about version control with our implementations of Git and of how to properly use external libraries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for QR Contacts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We didn't finish our proof of concept as we ran out of time, but we want to continue working on it afterwords and add all of our intended features. We also would like to try again to move it to be able to be used as an app.
