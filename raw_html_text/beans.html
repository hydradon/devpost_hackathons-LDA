                    It is an app dedicated for people who wants to automate coffee loyalty cards since nowadays it is very had to keep a hard copy of a coffee loyalty card. Integrating the barcode API and implementing a back-end, we are able to create a whole user interface of automated coffee loyalty card.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are three applications that we built, the app for the customer, the app for the coffee shop and the back end server. We use Android studio for the front end and a server with RESTful APIs.
