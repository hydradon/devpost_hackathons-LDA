                    At the start of the day, we all had lots of conflicting ideas. Tensions were getting a little high, so we realized we all needed to chill and de-stress a bit. That gave us the idea for our project-- something that could help people calm down and breathe. 
Think is a website that is intended to help people to calm down if they&rsquo;re feeling stressed. It features a visual cue for people to breathe along with, helping them to focus on their breathing, which has been proven to help deal with stress. It also features a calming ambient noise, for those who find the sound to be relaxing.
