                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Clustered and isolated farmers are found around Africa with no access to market, their produce is consumed by them and their nearest neighbor whereas a lot of people need their product but resort to importation while our local produce endup in waste bins.
Nigeria&rsquo;s demand for tomato is about 2.2mt/annum we are producing about 1.5 million tons but 0.7mt is lost post-harvest delivering 0.8mt to the market while about .7mt is being imported in both fresh and processed form into the country.
Coffee producers in Nigeria have no access to market as well, most of what they produce rots while some are being consumed by the people around them but there is market availability for imported coffee
Fruits as well get rotten in tons annually as there is no enough market access for them and no access to both local and foreign processors.
These problems also affects most other locally produced foods, some either have no access to market or processors leaving the farmers poor and hopeless.

                    ) connects farmers, buyers and processors together as well as consumers and retailers in the open market.
Most farmers are not literate about use of internet therefore, we are designing our platform to forward online inquiry to farmers via SMS on their mobile phones so they can call the potential customer to have verbal conversation.
At the same time, it is our duty to collect information from farmers who cannot post their product on the platform by themselves integrate it for them and also create awareness so that buyers, farmers and processors can get linked up

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    We are using a Drupal Content Management System (CMS) with other programming languages such as php,css, mysql and others for the development. The platform is still till under development.
