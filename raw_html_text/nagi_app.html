                <p>
                    Lot of times we see some pets in the streets. Some might have the time and heart to help. Some might have the heart but not the time. This motivated Nagi to do the Rescue operations. However, for the rescue operations, Volunteers are not easy to come by. We wanted to build a cheapest Volunteer,

                    How I built it Pet care
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Backend: DynamoDB, Jersey REST Webservice hosted on Elasticbeanstalk webserver run on AWS EC2 instance.
Frontend: Bootstrap
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also built an Android Application for the same.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into Pet care
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we built both Web and Android application from the scratch, We wanted the applications to be scalable, extendable and consistent in usages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We resolved this problem by having the backend as a Webservice hosted in AWS elastic beanstalk server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of Pet care

                <p>
                    Hosted the whole scalable webservice in cloud. Built a complete end to end solution that is easy for Nagi to use.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technically, we learnt to integrate Paypal's API to applications; DynamoDB complex queries.

                    To do's: Integrate extensive Deep learning to match pet images by implementing Convolutional Neural Network or Any similar algorithm.
