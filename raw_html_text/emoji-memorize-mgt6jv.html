                    Emoji-Memorize
                </h1>
                <p>
                    This game was made using pygame and included images found on google. The starting page flickers the letters of "Memorize" by going through a for loop that blits each letter one at a time. Then the rest of the images appear, which include "Emoji" text made to look like it was taped on the screen, an emoji in the bottom left, and the play button that highlights when the mouse hovers over it. 
When the play button is clicked the game screen appears that shows a bunch of neutral faced emojis on boxes made to mimic an iphone with apps. The bottom of the screen also has the score and the instructions. Once this screen appears the game starts and there is a count down (3,2,1) and after the countdown a pattern will appear given by the neutral faces changing to one of 9 different emojis. After the pattern is done the player must click the faces in the correct order otherwise they would lose. When they click the correct face an angel emoji will appear where they clicked and the score would increase. The number of pictures that the player have to memorize at first starts with 4 and increases by 1 every time the player completes the pattern correctly. When they do not click the right button an angel emoji will still appear where they click but the correct answer will change to a devil emoji then the game would go to the end screen.
The end screen shows "Game Over" again putting the letters on at a time. It also shows 3 emojis above it and underneath it has the high score and the score the player got. If the player beats the high score it says "New High Score" instead of just "High Score." Under the scores there are 2 buttons a "Try Again" button and a "Quit" button and again the highlight when the mouse hovers over them. In addition to that when hovering over the "Try Again" button a smiling emoji face appears to the right and when hovering over the "Quit" button a sad emoji face appears. The "Try Again" button brings the player back to the start screen where the would have to click the play button to play again. The "Quit" button closes the program as does clicking the x button in the corner of any screen the player is on.
