                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to create this when we saw the super long lines at hackathons and chess tournaments. Realizing that there must be an easier way to check-in to an event, we decided to create Check'N
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Check'N is an app that allows a user to check in to an event in seconds, while allowing anyone to create events and see current attendees who have shown up at the event. Simply scan the QR code that the administrator provides and you are all set. There is no longer a need for long lines at events to check-in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Firebase and Swift. We created phone authentication and a database using Firebase. Then, the Swift app communicated with the database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had never used Firebase before and it took a while to understand the format of the database as it was simply just JSON data, far different from databases we had seen in the past. In addition, we had no idea how phone authentication worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to create a functional version of the app that does most of the features we wanted it to do in the beginning. We are also proud of learning about Firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about Firebase and how it is used. We also learned how phone authentication works.

                    What's next for Check'N
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hope to add in-app messaging between the organizer and the attendee.
