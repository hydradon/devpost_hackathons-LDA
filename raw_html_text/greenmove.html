                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We belive that the traffic in Nice is horrible, which is also bad for the pollution, and many people for example students like us who don't know the city very well are not aware that there are plenty of ways of getting around faster while respecting the environment, for example the VeloBleu (Blue bike) , AutoBleu(Blue car - electric) that are available for rental by the regional organisation for a very small price..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application will give you a live map where you can see all the green ways of getting around that are located in your proximity, with details concering how many (bikes for example) are left, if there are any costs and so on..
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started using salesforce1 for building an application that could support our needs in a fair amount of time, and we are using opendatanice to load a database with all information in the application, where we use some salesforce APIs to help us provide proper services to the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Time: We lost our first day brainstorming for a different idea until realising that it was a bit out of context, which left us with less time to discover salesforce1 and the APIs.
Unfamiliar tasks: Our team was completely composed of IT students, so we were familiar with thinking out of the box, but we did not have many opportunities before to actually find ways of simply adding value to a project, or considering if it would be a valuable thing in our days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of being able to create a new project in a short amount of time, we also improved our skills to teamwork and learn doing new things from different perspectives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use Salesforce1 and the SaleForce APIs, information from OpenDataNice, but most importantly how to think outside of our main perspectives.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GreenMove
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would love to get it implemented on a global scale, because it does not only ecourage people to use more environmental friendly ways of transportation, but it also helps us to find the nearest and most practical ones.
