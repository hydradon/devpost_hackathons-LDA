                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I started testing out Microsoft Azure's Computer Vision API and the results were both accurate and fast, so I thought, if this is so close to how I would describe an image, why not help blind people using this technology? After that, I brainstormed what other functions would be useful for someone who was blind, and PySight was born.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    PySight has three main functions:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Image description
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Text translation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Motion detection to determine if there are moving cars in an video feed
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I originally wanted this to run on a Raspberry Pi (it was originally "PiSight", I just kind of got lucky that Python starts with the same sound) with buttons that blind people could easily distinguish, and a little camera on the back. I got it mostly functional and almost everything worked, but I updated the firmware using rbi-update, rebooted, and it never turned back on, so it was a bummer to not be able to produce a complete product. But I was able to demo all of the features that the Raspberry Pi would actually run, so I was overall happy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The image classifier got an accuracy of 100%, which I thought was really cool. I'm happy with the speed of everything as well, especially considering there's so much data being passed around to so many places.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of JavaScript and Flask. Amazon S3. Motion Estimation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PySight
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully, I can fix the Raspberry Pi and it can be a little $60 device that we can distribute to the visually impaired.
