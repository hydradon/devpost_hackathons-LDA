                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ve all seen a cliche scene like this, either in real life or in the movies: an ambiguous late-teens frustratingly throwing a textbook, their shoe, a pillow at their alarm clock, often missing it or hilariously knocking something else over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider the untapped potential - what if their pillow was the alarm clock?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enter the One Punch Pillow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine the ability to turn off your pillow by simply punching it, throwing it, drop kicking it across the room with the might of Zeus. One way or another, you&rsquo;re going to want to get out of bed to get that pillow back if you want to sleep more. In doing so, you are up and at &lsquo;em.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No sonar tone. No searching for a snooze button. No missing your 8 am. Just waking up on time.
                </p>
