                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of having a multiplayer game that one player draws and other players guess the drawing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The players enter a room and one player should draw the given word and draws it. Then, the other players are going to guess what the drawing is while the person is drawing, whoever guesses first gets 3 points after that they have 10 seconds to guess and the next player which guesses gets 1 points. The person who made the drawing gets 2 points if at least one person guesses his drawing correctly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made an HTML page that communicated with a node.js server using socket.io.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making the drawing environment and having it synchronize between clients and removing the restrictions of scaling between devices. Also having states for each player and changing them while notifying the clients of these changes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Keep it the game running without crashing and make it work on a server.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use lots of new libraries, and how to separate the work according to what people are good at (this was actually very hard).
                </p>

                    Putting it on server that anyone can use and
