                    First-line responders and survivors of human trafficking aren&rsquo;t easily able to find organizations/services that are relevant and applicable to their needs. Often, they scroll through lists of organizations/services, click on each one, only to find that they don&rsquo;t offer services for a particular individual.

                    We've created an API of survivor resources information and a searchable database for responders (doctors, nurses, police, social workers, etc.) as well as survivors of human trafficking to input their needs and qualifications to quickly identify relevant organizations.

                    (e.g. Sophia, a 21 year old female survivor of human trafficking is looking for housing and legal services in San Francisco and prefers to receive services in Spanish, if possible. When she inputs these criteria, she's matched up with the organizations that offer what she's looking for.)
