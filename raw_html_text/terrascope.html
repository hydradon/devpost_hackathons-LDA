                    Going on a tour that costed wayyyyyyyy too much. Of course, I wanted something much cheaper ;) So, I designed my own "tour" with app inventor
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It measures your location and when you arrive, it has speech built in that will tell you all about the location you are at. Then, it will tell you what to visit next.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I tried to get the android app studio to work with google maps but it was hard to test it out, so I used MIT App inventor instead
