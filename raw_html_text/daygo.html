                    Where the day goes!

                    Our idea branched off the thought of a visualization of the day ahead of you. There are currently plenty of apps that show you past events, and everything is based off the past. Our thought was, since everyone is looking towards the past, why not look toward the future? DayGo is a new, and innovative way to experience your day BEFORE it actually happens.

                    It takes your daily schedule, and creates a short virtualization of the events you have planned for the day. We managed to pull together resources to host an online website that gathers your routine for the day and outputs it into video format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some future additions to this app will be a sharing option for social media, connection to your google calendar to easily manage your schedule, syncing the application with your alarm clock and TV to play the video as you wake up, and adding music to enhance the experience.
