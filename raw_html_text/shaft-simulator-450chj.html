                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were thinking of ideas of an actual program we could make that could actually solve an actual problem. We all like playing games and some of our favorites have loot boxes, which is when it hit us that we should make a simulator for them to remove the need to grind or spend money to get loot boxes, and still get the feeling of getting something good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This simulator is supposed to utilize the estimated(and some official) rates of pulling certain items of certain rarities. Using those rates, it simulates opening a box or case and displays the rarities of the items you got.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using C++ in Visual Studios. In our code, we have many if tests running through user inputs to determine what game they want to simulate, and what crate they wish to open. Then it runs through ifs that check the ranges of our randomly generated number to determine the rarity of the item. We allow the user to run the program as much as they want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The only real challenge at first was brace management for all of our if statements. If we messed up one of the brace's placement, we would have to go back and check where each brace linked to. Our other set of problems were primarily just the tedious task of typing out all of the skins.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're mostly proud of the overall effectiveness and accuracy of the program. Were we to match these simulations to in game openings, they would be pretty close in accuracy. This and the overall aesthetic of the program is what we believe to be our greatest accomplishments.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of planning and carefully creating our work. Because of our many issues with braces and our lack of ideas, we know what not to do in the next hackathon we attend.
                </p>

                    What's next for Shaft Simulator
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're mostly just going to add more games, and possibly work on visuals/graphics that can be implemented in the program. This is a project we would very much like to continue.
