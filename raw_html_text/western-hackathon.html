                    Has a friend ever recommended a movie to you and you can't for the life of you remember what it is? MovieQueue is a web-based social application that allows users to create and build a queue of movies to watch in the future! Users can view other users' profiles for ideas on what to watch as well! Splendid!

                    To make it as easy as possible for users to get started, we utilize Facebook's secure log in and authentication to get quick access to our web application.

                <p>
                    Given a movie name, we use TMDb's API to find that movie and all sorts of information associated with that movie.

                <p>
                    The Facebook API would not co-operate with AngularJS without having Facebook's API Key. Therefore, we had to replace Angular with .EJS template incorporation. We also used Bootstrap for styling.
