                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a dream to help drivers find a location in UBC Okanagan's hard-to-find parking spots by navigating them to the nearest parking lot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ideally, we would want to digitally map a parking lot and the location of each parking spot, save them into the computer's memory, and record their vacancies and coordinates. Using the GPS feature on user's phone, drivers would be able to retrieve live information regarding empty spots in a parking lot. The app would then be able to guide the driver to the nearest parking spot available.
Our program does not currently work in the ideal world. At the current stage, it is able to process a manually-prepared bitmap file that outlines a parking lot and identify parking spots in the area. It knows the location of the entrance, parking spots, and no-parking spots like the driveway. We had the idea of implementing a pathfinding algorithm using a breadth-first search method; unfortunately, we did not have enough time to finish it. It was mainly due to fixing the endless bugs in identifying the parking lots in the bitmap. In the end, we're saddened that we were unable to finish the whole project in its whole. We truly hope to see part of our creation take flight in UBCO.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We mainly used Java programming language and implemented all ideas contributed by all of our members.

                    We were having trouble in working together as a team as we couldn't find an agreement in mutual coding practices.
