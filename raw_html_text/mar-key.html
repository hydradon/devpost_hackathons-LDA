                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Los Angeles is an absolute hotbed for local venues and rising artists. As a team of all Los Angeles natives, we wanted to build a mobile app that would help other music lovers learn about and listen to artists who will be playing at a local venues. We saw a new and unique opportunity to present this experience with innovative BoseAR technology. By integrating music with BoseAR controls and venue information from the Bandsintown API, users of mar/Key can walk along the streets of Los Angeles and listen to artists that would be playing at a venue near them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the location of the user, mar/KEY finds all events, artists, and venues near the user in the near future, and allows the user to listen to songs of each artist. Using BoseAR, the user can skip songs, choose the next artist, and buy tickets to the event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    mar/KEY takes the geo-coordinates of the user and other inputs (such as date), and submits those parameters into the Bandsintown API to get all the events, artists, and venues that are near the location of the user. The app would then find all compile all the unique artists into a list and play the audio clips associated to each artist. BoseAR would act as an additional control so users can choose an artist (affirmative), skip a song (input), or choose next artist (negative).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our largest challenges was deciding the user flow within the app and how the users would interact with the BoseAR technology. We wanted the app to be able to take sophisticated actions, but wanted to keep the user interface and interactions simple and easy to understand.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to not only integrate both the BoseAR technology and the Bandsintown API into our app, but also combine them in a new and innovative way. These two pieces were critical for the success of our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had not worked with Bose AR and Bandsintown API before. Getting to use these API's was a very exciting and useful experience. We learned about the music industry and the requirements for sound partnerships in music technology. Additionally, we learned that user flow in an application is crucial for success of the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for mar/KEY
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to integrate the Spotify API to more easily and seamlessly stream music to mar/Key. Additionally, we would like to continue working with Bandsintown to improve our usage of their API. Also, the background running of this application would be very useful for our users. Throughout this whole process, we would continue to listen to our users to improve on mar/KEY, as well as work with the artists to personalize their playlist with their own messages.
