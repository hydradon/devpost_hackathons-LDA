                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has been a tourist at some point in their lives. The problems we have come across in a foreign country are mostly the language barriers which makes it difficult for a pleasant experience. We want to help out foreigners, including ourselves to ease that process of being in a foreign country. We believe that the three essential components of every travelers' needs are finding a bathroom, affordable wifi spots, and charging stations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It connects the user to the nearest bathroom, wifi, and charging station based on their location. The places where the user can find these needs at are coffee shops, restaurants, boutiques, as well as public places.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react-native's framework to build parts of the application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard implementing google map onto our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're able to build and prototype the interface for our application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to be a team player and communicate effectively.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for RUSH
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step for RUSH would be getting it functional using react-native's framework. Hopefully, this pitch won't be our last because we really believe in our idea and would be more happy to see it come to life.
