                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What would it take to pray for every person on earth? From a Facebook experiment, we discovered it would take less than 1% of the world's population to pray for everyone on earth. Inspired by 1 Timothy 2, we invite all believers to experience the joy of praying for others, like their friends, family, coworkers, and beyond.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app shows you 3 contacts to pray for every day, so that over time the user prays for everyone they know.
This hackathon, we focused on improving the "joy" aspect of the iOS app, by implementing a celebration screen when a person prays for all their contacts. We also implemented the user onboarding, so they understand how to use the app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    iOS native app, UX design
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Staying focused on the things that improve the experience without "gamifying" the prayer experience too much.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the experience will help the user feel happy when using the app, and will help improve the social sharing of the app so others can find out about it too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                    Paper + pen + conversation = good ideas that I would never have thought of
