                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Do you have trouble keeping with a habit? Do you always start with full enthusiasm and then abandon your plans in the middle of the way? Building a good habit is important yet difficult. We need a constant reminder or an incentive to help us stick to our habits. Since games are a great way to motivate people, we want to build an interactive game that encourages users to keep up with their goals and form good habits.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Habit Grower is a game where users can adopt pets. Each pet symbolizes one habit, such as sleep early or does more exercise. After inputting a habit, the user chooses a habit pet. The adopted pet will show up on the mainboard when the user enters the app along with the health index. To keep the pets alive, the user has to finish the habit task first and then check-in daily by clicking the check-in button displayed on each pet's profile. If the user does not check-in in on seven consecutive days, the pet will die and the user has to re-adopt another habit pet. We wish to use feeding habit pets to motivate users to keep up with the habits that they are trying to form.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Xcode to define the User Interface and create relevant classes and data for the project.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first time building an iOS app from scratch so we need to learn how to write code in Swift. And there are multiple view controllers and we need to figure out a way to pass data into between. Then we need to figure out how to use Core Datta to save users' data to the device to have persistent data. At last, the task is to design a user-friendly interface to welcome our users!
                </p>

                <p>
                    We successfully made our first iOS app from scratch in two days.

                    What's next for Habit Grower
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Habit Grower 2.0 we plan to incorporate more properties for the habit pets and add more constraints to the life condition of the pets. For example, the longer the user keeps up a habit, the healthier and stronger his/her pets become. The pet can grow from an egg to an adult pet.
