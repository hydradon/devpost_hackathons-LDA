                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to provide the modern generation a means of purchasing stock in a safe, calculated manner. We also wanted to explore both computer science and stocks in an applied manner.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Based on data extracted from trading information, profitability, and balance sheets, the StockAnalyzer calculates a value for each selected stock and ranks them in descending order according to their value.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    StockAnalyzer is written in Java and designed in the NetBeans IDE using a drag-and-drop interface.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some challenges included designing the overall project, attempting to scrape data from websites, designing the main algorithm that runs the analysis, sorting ArrayLists and displaying them into GUI text format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think we have a modernly designed app GUI that implements a scientific algorithm and has interesting displays. Furthermore, we think we have come up with an innovative idea that is both trending and functional.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to collaborate in teams, brainstorm an executable plan, sorting data with ArrayLists, and designing GUI using NetBeans.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for StockAnalyzer2018
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will be looking forward to developing a more scientific, accurate algorithm for StockAnalyzer. For example, the user "risk" assessment can be further perfected to efficiently reflect the user's preferences. In addition, we are planning to implement live stock updates to our engine to include more selections and accurate information.
