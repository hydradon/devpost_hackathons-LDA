                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was thinking about social good and what obstacles people might face and it sorta just came to me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a python program that is specifically for visually impaired people how to type. It has essentially three sections: learning the alphabet, practice words, and freeform where you can type whatever you want and it will say what you have typed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used google's text to speech api and python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    -getting google auth credentials
-how to play sounds

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    -google text to speech
-working with audio in python
-there are less resources than I expected for learning to type for the visually impaired
                </p>

                <p>
                    -the rest of the keyboard
-more teaching content: ex. type combinations jfjf, jdkdj, flskf
-user testing to have better dialogue and speech tutorials
-using speech to text for the complete beginner, to get the program started
