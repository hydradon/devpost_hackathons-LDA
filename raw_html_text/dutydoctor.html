                    Why we made it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest problem with sick babies is that they can't tell you what's wrong. In order to fix this parents must observe what's going on with their baby 24/7 which can be quite stressful. We attempt to mitigate the stress by making an easy to use app that helps clarify what's going on with their baby.

                    What DutyDoctor does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DutyDoctor is an app that allows new parents to examine their baby's poop, enter their findings into the program, and the app will explain what's the possible ailments are. The first question new parents are asked is the their feeding habits. They can choose from breastfeeding, soft foods, and solid foods. The next question is about the color the poop is. They can click on a range of common colors. The last part is the consistency of the poop. Once answering these questions the most likely problem will appear and what can be done about it or if it's okay.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main activity is the diagnostic test. Once clicking on that button the activity shifts to the actual test, breaking it down into the three components above. After each click, the previous question will disappear and the next will appear. At the end of the question cycle a diagnosis will pop up. Each set of answers to the questions will be added together and match a given case found within the program. The case is what determines what answer is given at the end of the test.

                    Challenges
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first we had problems switching activities from the main. Another problem we had with activities is choosing how many to have. In the beginning we had 3 different activities added to the main, but it ended up just being a lot of duplicated code. We fixed this by combining the activities. Making sure to include every combination of problem was also a challenge.

                    Proud moments
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every time the code did remotely close to what we wanted it to do, it was immensely satisfying. Also seeing the end result was nice too. Seeing how everything comes together always has a rewarding feeling to it.

                    Two thirds of our group has no experience in android studio so using that was a major learning curve.
