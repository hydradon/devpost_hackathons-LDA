                    Did this happen to you? You're at a party and you want to play beerpong. Looking for a partner you ask around, who's in it to win it. To the question
                    <em>
                        "are you good at beerpong?"
                    </em>
                    most people tend to say yes. 10 minutes and a crushing defeat later you and your
                    <em>
                        skilled
                    </em>
                    partner stand there. He only hit 1 cup.

                    People often overestimate their own skill, especially when there is no real skill indicator.
Frustration of one-sided beerpong games led up to our idea to create a skill measure.
