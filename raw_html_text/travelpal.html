                    The problem:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Missing flights or having to wait at airports because of delays or cancellations is very common. This is a huge problem and hassle because many travelers could choose to wait at home or stay at work instead of in the airport. Although 25% of flights are delayed, this information can be gathered and given to the traveler before many of them leave for the airport.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Solution:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are developing a product that will provide In-Location targeted and time specific information to help travelers get to their flight on time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TravelPal gives the traveler real time updates on traffic and flights, alerting them when they should leave for the airport. TravelPal also guides travelers through the airport process (check-in), security and boarding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are using BLE technology based Beacons to identify the precise locations of the check-in counter, security check point and boarding gates inside the airport. In the origin city, each beacon will help to measure the line time at check-in and security and in the destination city they will be used to help send notifications about relevant information and deals (rental cars and transportation deals).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The TravelPal application will be used for traveler tracking before entering the airport and the beacons will be used to track progress once inside the airport.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time with the Sabre API:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It looks like there's no flight status REST API, the suggestion was to use the schedules API which uses a different technology (SOAP) than the InstaFlight API which we used to get the upcoming flights given the current date and time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got flights from current time through the end of the day to load in the event that you miss your flight.
                </p>

                    What I learned:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We learned what you can use the Sabre API for roundtrips.

                        AngularJS

                </ul>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TravelPal:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to integrate TravelPal with other API's to get traffic, route information and also flight status and test out the beacon technology. TravelPal is an end-to-end trip product that will aid the traveler on their entire journey.
