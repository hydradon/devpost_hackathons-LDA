                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilize SparkPost to route emails to Firebase, from there we have a node.js server grabbing the emails from firebase, processing them, modifying the game state on firebase, and using Sparkpost to generate and send reply emails.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into some challenges setting up the DNS of our domain but with enough time we figured it out. Additionally, the chess engine we used was effectively undocumented, resulting in a disproportionate amount of time being spent on simple bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to create exactly what we imagined in just 48 hours. We are also proud to have created a system that can be used any where across the world. It also allows people to compete with both minimal bandwidth and any language (as long as it  is French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, or English.)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for QuibbleMail
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we will continue to develop QuibbleMail and add more game modes and features to connect people all over the world. We also seek to increase the number of language integrations and improve system stability and accessibility.
