                    This idea was first inspired by the people that have trouble texting.
                </h2>

                    This means people that have trouble expressing their emotions, and feelings. We understand that not everyone is the same and that there is not actually a solution for the persons that are introverted, or that can express their feelings in how they want it to be. Sometimes texting takes away those special moments with friends, family, and either love ones because in the moment we do not have the right thing to say. 
By brainstorming ideas we found that the girls in the team quoted: 
My friends annoy me with daily screenshots of texts about their crush asking "what do I say back to this?"
The main idea of this app is to create pre-made messages that are too"difficult to respond to" so the team created messages that are separated into 16 categories. So, you'll never have to ask your friends what to say ever again since this app will make it more efficient for you.
