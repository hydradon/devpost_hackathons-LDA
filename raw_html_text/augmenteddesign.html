                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've made custom shirts before, and we always cross our fingers and hope the design comes out like we made it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a procedure to identify a grid pattern in an image and calculate a transformation to project a chosen design onto the grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We created a web app where you can upload your shirt design and see what it looks like on real models wearing the grid pattern.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used several features of OpenCV, including adaptive thresholding, finding contours, polygonal smoothing, our own heuristic for finding and several perspective transforms to remap the image onto a deformed grid.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Running into problems with OpenCV compatibility.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our algorithm is fairly robust and can detect all the squares in an image if they are visible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used some OpenCV functions we had used before, but we had to explore several new ideas to efficiently calculate our transformations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Augmented Design
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our computations are fast enough to be applied to real time videos.
This grid idea can be applied to several use cases besides the custom t-shirts, and can be used for all different types of Augmented Reality.
