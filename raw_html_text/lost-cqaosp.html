                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we heard the topic first, several topics leaped to the forefront of our minds. Surgery simulators, exercise apps. But the one that we really identified with, the idea that seemed most meaningful to us, was helping those who were sidelined by society. Depression is treated as a joke, something that can be cured by just "getting happy." We needed to do something about it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The goal of Lost is to educate people about the real struggles of people suffering from depression through something they are passionate about: games. We try for an symbolic style of storytelling, with simplistic hand-drawn graphics emulating a flipbook. Through this, and through a lot of intricate development of key features that represent the difficulties of depression, we tell a story that educates others about this difficult condition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Lost on the Unity game engine. Our method was to create the individual components of the code and then meld them together at the end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into errors at the final step, when we were struggling with patching bugs that occurred when combining the movement of certain elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud of creating an art and gameplay style that truly relates and symbolizes the difficulties of depression.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use the graphics program Procreate to develop sprites for games. We also learned how to develop more complex games on Unity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Lost
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We might continue Lost. It has a premise that we're quite proud of, and the potential to go places. If we keep this up and finish the game, we could create something great.
