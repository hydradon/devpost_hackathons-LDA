                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Trying to think of a witty comment to send your friends is always difficult, especially quickly. We were looking for something to provide quick response to the tweet, but also staying relevant
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using information for any given twitter post, a user can enter in a keyword and the database will look for a quote that fits with the keyword
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We decided to use python, because that is the language that we are both most familiar with and being as that its both our first hackathons, we used a build style that were were familiar with. We used api's from twitter(tweepy) and random quote generator
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We initially ran into a lot of problems running the programs on our computers, and just getting started in general, but once we got used to the syntax and how to run the code it went relatively smoothly. We could not figure out how to use heroku so we opted to use tkinter instead
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are putting out a finished product in our first hackathon and actually getting a front end product to work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of troubleshooting skills along with how to cut loses and go with a new direction.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Qweet!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Were hoping to market it on a large scale, making it a free to use app while offering extra paid functionalities, along with expanding the amount of quotes that it draws from and making it easier to integrate with twitter
