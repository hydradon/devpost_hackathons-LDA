                <p>
                    The problem is many of us have a short fuse when it comes to shopping, especially men.
You don&rsquo;t want to waste any time searching trough all the options, and you might not know what
looks good with what. There are always occasions where you don&rsquo;t know what to wear or how to
complete your look. We&rsquo;ve worked on solving these common problems among men between the ages
of 21 and 38.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;ve found ways to accommodate your style trough the Zleek app. We inspire,
educate and accommodate you through styles and choices that will fit the type of person you are. For
Zalando, that means more sales, and for the consumer it means an effortless shopping experience.
The secret to impeccable style is knowing how to coordinate the colour of your clothes and dress for
your body type. Our app is the middleman between you, the customer, and the online shop. The app
acts as the most helpful shopping advisor as it demonstrates options that fit your signature style,
based on the picture you take and your own input.

                            You will have to pick a style out of four general styles that you feel related to. Take a picture of your outfit and highlight a specific item you want to either replace or want to match it with other items to buy a look. .

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We focused on the difficulties in the project and started solving them at first. For example for extracting data from an image in terms of garment, color and pattern. We didn't succeed in implementing a very useful clothing parsing library, we found
                    <a href="http://hi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/%7Eesimo/publications/SimoSerraACCV2014.pdf" rel="nofollow">
                        this research paper that has an implementation of the solution.
                    </a>
                    With some more time and an Unix based development environment we are sure this is implementable in a short notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suggesting garments to a user was the most difficult part for us. It was important for us to know the fundamentals of fashion consulting and put those rules into code. During our research in this field we came across various set of rules that we can use. We focused on color combination styling and wrote the set of rules that lead to a more stylish look within your own style category. Other possibilities that we didn't implement in the designs but have designed in terms of code is clothes suggestion based on your body build.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We identified 2 main challenges.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Classifying garments through an image and finding colors and patterns
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Making suggestions based on what the person is wearing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We proudly converted the basic fundamentals of how a fashion consultant gives advice. By mainly focusing on color matching. From there we are able to build further with body shape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though we didn't have something working that extracts data from an image, (data like colors and patterns in clothes). We got closer than people expected we could come.
