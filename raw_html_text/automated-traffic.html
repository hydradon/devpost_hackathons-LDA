                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have always wondered whether or not vehicles need to stop at intersections if the drivers would know exactly at what speed to travel to avoid each other.  This hack is a first draft test run.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Simulates an intersection under heavy traffic conditions and, based on several detectors, speeds up or slows down cars to avoid collisions at an intersection.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unity, C#, some physics, lots of patience and perseverance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Issues with trigger detection across multiple different colliders.  Difficulty finding the best solution to detecting when to adjust speed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a 4 way intersection filled with vehicles traveling in the 4 cardinal directions.  Though it's imperfect, it manages to provide entertainment when things don't go quite right.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scripting in C#, some of Unity's limitations, cloud9 and it's awesomeness.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Automated Traffic
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'd like to see a perfect version implemented in the far future when all or nearly all vehicles are automated.  Eliminating unnecessary stops at intersections would clear up a lot of traffic.
                </p>
