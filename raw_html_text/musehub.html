                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to connect artists, producers, videographers, and graphic designers in one centralized hub to invite collaboration with any other entertainer that may inspire them. We also hoped that those looking to work on an upcoming project would ideally come on to the site, so as to find people who they feel would be a great addition to their project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We split the app into 4 main sections, a page for artists, producers, videographers, and graphic designers. On each page, entertainers are able to put their best work on there for others to get a small taste of what they have to offer. If one were to be interested, they would then just click on their profile, which would show even more of their work. They could then message each other and agree to buy work off of each other, or possibly collaborate on a mutually beneficial deal.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node.js, React, and Firebase for most of the web app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had ever worked with React, and 2 of our teammates left in the middle of the event.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The entire app workflow and the aesthetic that comes with it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pretty much React
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for museHub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to gauge the reception we get, and perhaps keep working with it if we see that it's something that generally interests people.
