                <p>
                    After doing some user research, we found that there is a big problem for homeless people to find emergency shelters close to them with available spots.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We worked for 3 days non-stop!!!
For the frontend, we used Angularjs to get and post data to the database, and used google map API to present the map to the homeless people
For the backend, we used tornado to run and host our websites
