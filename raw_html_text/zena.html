                    Lack of knowledge on Sexual Reproductive health can be life-threatening. Learning and educating refugee girls on how they can navigate this taboo landscape is a problem we are passionate about.

                <p>
                    We built it on the Facebook Messenger platform
                </p>

                    <li>
                        The fact that we were able to build this in less than a day, from conception to product.

                    <li>
                        We personally feel very motivated about the problem we're solving. Just learning about all the life-threatening problem girls much younger than us are going through, that, by itself is stirring us into action that will hopefully continue beyond this hackathon.
