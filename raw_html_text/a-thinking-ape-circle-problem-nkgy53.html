                <p>
                    Imagine you have a circle of people and you go around the circle removing every second person until one person is left.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have 3 people in the circle, then the 3rd person will be the last one remaining.
If you have 4 people then the 1st person will be the last one remaining.
If you have 11 people then the 7th person will be the one remaining.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have N people in the circle, who will be the last one remaining?
                </p>

                    Please formulate your answer as a general solution and not as an algorithm that simulates the problem.

                    Solution (pdf file attached in the step 2)

                <p>
                    The general solution is:
                </p>
                <p>
                    x = (n - 2^floor(log_2(n))) * 2 + 1
                </p>
                <p>
                    where x indicates the remaining person.

                    Explaining the formula:
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can see the pattern of the arithmetic progression in a common difference of 2 as we can see in the test below:
                </p>
                <p>
                    N = 2    X = 1th
                    <br>
                    N = 3    X = 3th
                    <br>
                    N = 4    X = 1th
                    <br>
                    N = 5    X = 3th
                    <br>
                    N = 6    X = 5th
                    <br>
                    N = 7    X = 7th
                    <br>
                    ...
                    <br>
                    N = 15  X = 15th
                    <br>
                    N = 16  X = 1th
                    <br>
                    ...
                    <br>
                    N = 32  X = 1th
                    <br>
                    N = 33  X = 3th
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you can see, the value of x will be a progression of 2, with a starting value of 1. (1, 3, 5, 7...)
                    <br>
                    The point is that this progression is restarted to the initial value in every power of 2 as we can see the same values 1 for 2^0, 2^1, 2^2 and so on...
                </p>
                <p>
                    N = 2    X = 1th  N = 2&sup1; ??? Set value 1!!
                    <br>
                    N = 3    X = 3th
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    N = 4    X = 1th   N = 2&sup2; ??? Reset to value 1!!

                    N = 7    X = 7th   +2
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    N = 8    X = 1th   N = 2&sup3; ??? Reset to value 1!!
                    <br>
                    ...
                    <br>
                    N = 15  X = 15th
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    N = 16  X = 1th   N = 2^4 ??? Reset to value 1!!
                    <br>
                    N = 17  X = 3th  +2
                    <br>
                    N = 18  X = 5th +2
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Explaining the formula:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 1) 2^floor(log_2(n))
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will result as the maximum power of 2 under the given number n. We need this value to indicate wheter its the beginning of a new progression.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        So we can take n = 15 as an example:
The 2^floor(log_2(15)) is equal to 2&sup3;
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Step 2) (n - 2^floor(log_2(n)))
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we need get the position of the element in the progression.
So we have:
                </p>
                <p>
                    15 - 2&sup3; = 7
                </p>
                <p>
                    This result represent the position in the progression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 3)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we have to multiply by 2 (which is the common difference of the progression) and sum by 1 (because the progression starts with 1).
Then, we have:
                </p>
                <p>
                    7 * 2 + 1 = 15
                </p>
                <p>
                    15 is the remaining person of the circle in a total of 15 people.
