                    Our inspiration were the APIs Amadeus provided us with and we just used them to elaborate our app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our app makes traveling easier and less stressful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built with Xcode in Objective-C.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had many challenges with the code, but we were able to solve them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are proud for being here and completing the app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We learned many things from the sponsors and new ways of coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, it is unknown, but hopefully something great!
