                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Refugees in war stricken zones have minimal access to diagnostic labs and are ravaged by diseases that can be easily prevented by timely detection. Moreover, the time taken for a disease to become widespread and the arrival of medication takes time and causes further harm. Our software and hardware aims a bridging that gap.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an attempt to provide lab facilities in war stricken zones like Syria and provide diagnosis and study disease spread patterns in these areas with the data collected and hosted on cloud.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed a prototype of the lab using AutoCad and the code for interfacing it to cloud using python and the ManaHealth API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project was a little difficult to replicate in hardware and none of us had never coded in python before. We learnt to code in python overnight and developed the code overnight too. Moreover, to overcome the replication of software, we designed and simulated it as closely as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learnt a new language! And came up with a brilliant idea on how to make a lab distribution system more effective!
                </p>

                <p>
                    We hope to prototype and test it real time.
