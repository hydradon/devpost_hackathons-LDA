                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make it easier for people to connect and start conversations
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We store the interests of people as well as their faces in a database. When you hover over their face with your camera, it shows a list of interests that are shared between the two individuals
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created the front end with react native, the backend with express, aws, and mongodb
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the AR to work nicely was a lot harder than we thought and took a large chunk of our time. We also needed to transfer large amounts of data in a very short time so compressing and reducing the quality just enough for the application to still work was a hard balance to find.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you want to analyze a live video, don't do it by taking 20 pictures every second and analyzing the pictures individually
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Augmented Conversation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This idea is mostly a proof of concept for how it would work with augmented reality goggles, like google glasses. The main goal is to get it working on a similar platform eventually
