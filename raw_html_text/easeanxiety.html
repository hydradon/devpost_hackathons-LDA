                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all feel anxious especially due to stress from school or work, but sometimes it's hard to know what to do when we are panicked. To relieve stress it's good to focus on simple, and calming tasks which is what our app brings to the users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app opens on a serene ocean view and takes you to a breathing square, helping you breathe as it counts breaths with you. This will ultimately help the user calm down from any stress and send them to their happy place :)

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Swift to build the iOS application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the members of the team were familiar with Swift so we had to start from scratch for everything. We had difficulty connecting the user interface part with the actual swift code. Sometimes we would make one small change that would crash the app, but luckily we had mentors who are more familiar with Swift and guided us on how to resolve our issues and think a little deeper about how to make out code more efficient.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of Saturday, we only had a game plan, no code yet, but by the end of the day we had a working app that has the potential to help so many people alleviate their stresses and surround themselves with positive vibes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Swift and the capabilities it has to produce an iOS app. We had no idea that we can literally drag and drop different pieces that we want to incorporate onto the main screen and then later on go into the actual code. Also the word for null/None in Swift is nil which I found to be interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EaseAnxiety
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to try to incorporate more parts to the app, like some soothing ambient music, and other "games" that the user can play to relieve their stress like popping bubbles on a screen. Moreover, we wanted to incorporate different themes into the app so that each individual can customize the app to transport themselves to their own happy place, so the app can act as a safe haven for all.
