                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that was streamlined so that everyone could use it easily, even those that tend to find technology intimidating such as the elderly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Geras allows communities to come together through a simple event planning web app. Designed with the elderly in mind, we wanted to make registration and the interface as simple as possible. With only a few clicks, people are able to link to their community, create an account, and begin voting and to RSVP for events that their community is or may be hosting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By using the Google Maps API, we are able to register a community to a set of coordinates. When members go to sign up, their location is used to suggest the nearest community to join. Using MongoDB as a local host, we use React to keep communities, its members, and their events connected to each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was difficult to initially integrate the Google Maps API as there is no "tag" for retirement communities. We pivoted to using physical coordinates that we could add to a community to allow members to join.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're very happy with the fact that our registration process is incredibly simple and lets the users become a voice in their community immediately. Our minimalist, but effective interface makes it very apparent to the user what is happening and doesn't bog them down with irrelevant information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Not everyone on the team was familiar with React, but dove into learning to be able to contribute. We also needed to find a way to use Google Maps GPS to help users find their nearest community. Using the Haversine equation, we were able to allow users to access the community nearest them using their coordinates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Geras
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to be able to add several features to improve the service as well as its accessibility.
We would like to create an algorithm that would track votes and suggest activities or events to a community coordinator.
We would also want to add potential Alexa integration to allow the visually impaired to managed their events and calendar.
Finally, we want to allow savvy users to create events and submit them to a coordinator and make it easier for them to get their ideas for fun events heard.
