                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Laziness and safer driving

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Uses image recognition to read text from and recognizes if it is an address, or a web URL. If that is determined it will then search the web for that website or location through google maps or the address bar if it is a website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and implemented Googles Vision API to help us create a functional text recognition through the camera of a cellphone
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a lot of problems implementing a clear an concise text recognition, and we wanted to have a search history so the user could look back at what they "discovered" for later use, as well as wanting to use Esri's API, however there were a lot of problem implementing Esri's through gradle. Being so strapped on time, we had to scrap those ideas and ended up using a web browser for all our searches.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A ton of Android Studio. Although, there is more to learn, we can me more comfortable creating another android app from here on.
                </p>

                    What's next for Whereabouts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're hoping to continue the project and implement those things that we had to scrap.
