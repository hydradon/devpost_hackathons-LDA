                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were looking for a way to integrate our information into our day to day lives with the goal of saving money or improving productivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user enters in a monetary goal and a max limit to their spending, which should never be achieved. The website then estimates the daily cost of running the HVAC system at home and plots the point onto a  chart over the span of a month with the final point  being the goal. A trend line is created from the goal point and the most recent nest data point. The Nest system will then automate the temperature to save money.

                <p>
                    blood, sweat, and tears
Python programs with a flask framework to interact with the Nest home automation hardware. We pull bills from the potential user's account using the Capital One API. The user can view their spending progress using the beautiful python plot.ly graphs.
