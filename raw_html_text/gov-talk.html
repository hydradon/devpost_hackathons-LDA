                    We build a website intended to help people connect with their representatives in Congress. The original plan included collecting data about what bills are currently debated in Congress and allowing users to comment on these bills and draft letters to their representatives.

                <p>
                    We finished creating user accounts, which finds the user's representatives based on their street address.  After the user registers or logs in, they are taken to a dashboard page that displays identifying and contact information for their representatives.
                </p>

                    Demo should be up
