                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Small donations can make a big difference. Especially when it's an app like Uber (with millions of users)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website provides more information about the Donation program for Uber rides. It also shows the locations of homeless people using the Leaflet API. It also has a donation counter that simulates in real time how much money was donated by how many users.

                    How I built it

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had much experience in web development, using html5, javascript, css. We had to learn web development and create our own website.
