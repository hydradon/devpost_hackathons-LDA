                    Our goal is to inform potential adopters of the lifetime costs of dog ownership to reduce the rate of return. Our API provides monthly, annual and lifetime estimate costs based on dog breed as well as comparisons for average savings with pet insurance.

                    is a web application that helps potential dog adopters locate nearby dogs available for adoption and provides an estimated budget required to adopt. Users input a location and dog breed to receive a list of the closest available dogs of that breed to adopt, plus customized estimated budget for each dog. Budgets can be viewed monthly, annually, or lifetime, with cost comparison with and without pet insurance.

                <p>
                    Our project's main challenge was that we anticipated more dog breed data would be available, both through publicly available APIs and Nationwide's Pet Insurance API. Unfortunately, Nationwide's API takes longer to setup than we had during the hackathon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We manually researched and compiled data for 10 dog breeds, creating a new API that can provide custom budget information about the monthly, annual and lifetime costs of dog ownership, specific to those breeds and a variety of ages. We also provide a cost comparison of having pet insurance to encourage owners to purchase insurance.
