                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I usually cook from recipes on my phone or tablet. While cooking, I often forget about the ingredients and their quantities, which forces me to go to the phone, unlock it and scroll, usually with greasy or wet hands! I decided to develop an Alexa skill to help me.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You tell Alexa about the ingredients and quantities that you'll need for cooking and then you can just ask at any time. Alexa will remember the ingredients for 3 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The session with the ingredients is stored in a simple DynamoDB item. The actual skills is written in Python 3 and running in AWS Lambda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa isn't ready for numbers yet! It's tricky to handle decimals, for example.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It helped me cooking tonight!

                    What's next for Cook Recap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ability to save recipes and eventually being able to scrap the ingredients from recipes on the top cooking sites.
