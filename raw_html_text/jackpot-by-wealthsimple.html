                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I think we all agree that very few people actually win the lottery. You&rsquo;ll likely also agree these three statements are true:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Everyone likes money, and everyone wants to earn it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        People don&rsquo;t save enough.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        People like to gamble. We&rsquo;ve found that low income families spend nearly 10% of their income on lotto tickets.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    What if there was a way to win big, without having to risk losing any money at all?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Enter Jackpot.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Jackpot rewards YOU for making, maintaining, and growing your savings over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do this in the form of a prize linked savings account. Instead of receiving interest, Jackpot gives you entries in weekly, monthly, and annual lotteries.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Node to build a server with an Angular 5 frontend, using many of Wealthsimple's API's from the following endpoints:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        AUTHENTICATION
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ACCOUNTS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        USERS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DEPOSITS
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        WITHDRAWS
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Our app uses the OpenID Connect authorization code flow for authentication with serialized sessions. A non-relational MongoDB was also used to keep track of application specific data.
                </p>
