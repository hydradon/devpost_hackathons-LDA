                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Freemont has trouble locating packages, whether they're not making it to the final destination, making it to the wrong warehouse at the end destination (sometimes several miles away), or not being able to be easily found in the correct warehouse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Adds a digital identifying tracker (beacons) that allows users to see the complete history of where each package has gone, as well as updating contents, writing location notes, and approximate GPS coordinates when available.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed an iOS application that can identify these beacons. The app will transmit this information to the server to keep track of where each beacon has been, as well as letting mobile users edit location and box contents with both manual entry and the scanning of pre printed labels.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Both finding an adequate OCR solution and getting in functional on the limited internet access at this facility made the label identifying quite challenging.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Getting OCR working. Having a full functioning prototype.
