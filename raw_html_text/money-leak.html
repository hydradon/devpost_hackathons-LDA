                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We often find ourselves procrastinating on important things: studying for an exam, working on homework/projects, doing the laundry, or cleaning your room. There are many ways of trying to fight against procrastination. Our way of fighting it is to motivate ourselves with money.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is fairly simple. Users deposit a certain amount of money into their account. They then enter tasks they want to complete, a deadline for each task to be completed by, and the amount of money they want to dedicate towards that task. Once a user finishes a task, they click finish and the task goes away. For each day that the user goes over the deadline, the money dedicated towards the task decreases by a certain amount (We want the user to select different rates). This money is automatically donated towards the charity of their choice. This app will not make your bank account go negative. Once you are out of money, then it will stop deducting.

                        MongoDB was initializing attributes that didn't exist. We had deleted them from the schema but MongoDB thought it still existed. It was setting this non-existent attribute to null. This created a duplicate-key error that was hard to debug. The error message did not specify what attribute was set to null.
