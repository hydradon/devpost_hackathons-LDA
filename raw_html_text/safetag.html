                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spiderman - Into the Spider-verse was a great movie. We decided to build our app around the struggles Miles faced; especially with his inability to express himself through his street art. He had to go to great lengths and disobey authority, including his own father, to tag walls with his phenomenal art.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app, SafeTag, allows users to step into another dimension and express themselves with their own custom tags. Using AR Technology, they have the ability to place tags to unique locations and tag their spot using their own art work. Other users can then see all the art through the app and have the ability to communicate through art with other users.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Google's ARCore for iOS, Firebase, ARKit, XCode and iOS devices to build this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few challenges we ran into was connecting Firebase to the application to have other users see each others tags at the specific locations. We also had to develop our own custom tags objects/scenes for this project as the provided objects were insufficient. Another challenge we faced was getting the ARCore SDK to work correctly with our iOS devices.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We successfully pieced together an idea in less than 8 hours! We are proud of our collaborative effort and our ability to learn ARCode and XCode in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use AR technologies and integrate them with mobile devices. We also learned how to deploy iOS apps for testing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for SafeTag
                </h2>
                <p>
                    SafeTag's usage is endless.. Imagine a world where everyone can see each others art using AR and create their own. We look to add extended capabilities like creating your own avatar or profile so people can see how you express yourself. Another major feature we hope to implement in the future is an arts-agram of sorts that would enable tourism and bring people to new areas to explore.
