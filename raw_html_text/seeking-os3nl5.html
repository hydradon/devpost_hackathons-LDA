                    Our inspiration comes from the orienteering game. We aim to make the first domestic orienteering app, combined with AR. The app currently applies to Android mobile devices. A user can choose whether to start a new game or join a game already set up. When starting a new game, the user can take several photos and leave clues. And the users who join the game can go find the positions. After having found all positions, the game is completed. We used java, openGL, android studio to build the app. Since it is the first time we build an Android app, we have been faced with great difficulties. It took us a whole morning to set up the environment. But we are very amazed and satisfied to see our app works. We have groped our way of Android development. Under the restriction of time, it is only a coarse demo. But we can add more details to our app and make it more advanced.
