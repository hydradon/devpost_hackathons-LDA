                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to do something fun, and the Paulig Muki was such a fun concept that we couldn&rsquo;t resist.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application records the user&rsquo;s location, and creates a map that   shows where the user is drinking the coffee right now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application is based on the MukiTestApp, and uses the Google Play Api to get the location data, the map is created with the Google Maps Api, and finally the maps is sent to the muki with the Paulig Muki Api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MukiTestApp was not compatible with newer versions of Android, so first we had to make the app compatible with newer phones. Creating the app was overall quite hard, since nobody of us had any experience with Android development. Getting the Paulig Muki Api to work correctly was also tricky.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the application to work, with no experience with Android Development from before.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Development and how to use different APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GeoMug?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to send the map to your friends, and log different data, such as how far someone walks while drinking coffee etc.
