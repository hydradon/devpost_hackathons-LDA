                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To design the interface in the front end, we used bootstrap, CSS, HTML, and javascript.
Google Firebase, node,js, and the food2fork API hold it together.

                        <p>
                            When registering the domain name, we were charged a fee despite using it for the hackathon, and we then had to cancel the service.

                            We didn't realize that to integrate APIs outside of google, we needed to pay a fee which was not an option for us. Due to this last minute problem, we have to demo both part of the app separately.

                            We challenged ourselves to learn new things these past three days. We've have had no previous experience with Google Firebase, bootstrap, and APIs in general.

                        Everything applied today in our web app is built off of new knowledge we gained over the weekend; we did not use familiar methods and instead sought more efficient and sophisticated means.

                            There are features we wanted to add to the web app, but were not able to accomplish due to the amount of new technology we had to learn.
