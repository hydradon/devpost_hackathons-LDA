                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We intend to empower people especially women not only mentally, but physically as well through teaching self defense so that they may feel confident and safe to protect themselves and their loved ones if the time comes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program teaches the user self defense by training them to respond to indicators of physical threats that are most likely to be encountered within their daily lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example:
A right punch from a possible assailant can be countered by blocking left or weaving under.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using the Google Cloud AutoML API to train a model of self-defense move recognition as well as a basic Python GUI for portability on any PC with a webcam, we built a program that prompts users to train their self defense instincts.
