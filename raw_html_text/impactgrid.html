                    We implemented the prototype for ImpactGrid, a website designed to promote collaboration between international development organiztions. Organizations can sign up to create a profile for their organization and update the communtiy about projects they are currently working on. Organizations can then browse projects to find and connect with organizations they are interested in working with. Organizations can post both their needs or their project, and what their project can offer to other organizations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We failed to fully connect the backend and frontend, such that extensive searching was possible. We also were unable to implement a feature we were very excited about: organizations having the ability to flag topics they are interested in and be notified by email when a project dealing with the topic is posted.
