                    Inspiration

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were trying to build a web app where images for news articles are listed, and the person chooses which article they want to read based on their image choice. When they click on the image only the text of the article is returned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used html and GitHub for the website version. We tried using python, flask and python anywhere for the web app version.
                </p>
