                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DerWaldi wanted to read into his scientific papers on the go. Having your hands free would be a major benefit. So he tried listening to them. However, mathematical equations did not work at all with the pdf reader of his choice. 
Pitching the idea to us, we remembered lectures on accessibility for blind people and the lack of a good reader for scientific papers, especially mathemathical terms.
We hope ReadMyScience can not only help DemWaldi, but also some other people as well.

                    ReadMyScience reads your scientific papers out loud,  including the math terms.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use a python backend, tying everything together. 
Using tensorflow we tained the yolo object detection net to detect mathematical terms.
We used the MathPix WebAPI to get Latex code from the equations. 
After that we parsed the latex code with python in order to make it human readable/listenable.
Finally we used Google TTS to read it out loud.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TextBoxes in PDFs are hard to extract and hard to get into the correct order. 
PDFs are only goof for presenting, not for automatic data extraction.
Determine how to read aloud mathematical terms.
