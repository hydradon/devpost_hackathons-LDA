                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to solve an issue for archaeological artifacts that rightfully belong to the country of origin. Many sites are looted, there are many frauds, and tracking provenance is in the hands of a few separate groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having a decentralized database is the perfect in that data about who owns what artifacts should not be owned by anyone. This project has since expanded to a system that uses social media to verify the identity of people who authenticate artifacts, antiques, collectibles, etc...
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has been estimated that 60% of art and antiques are counterfeit. Thus, a system needs to not only track provenance but it needs to also have verified and trustworthy authenticators who expertly validate an artifact is, indeed, authentic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system places a signature on Twitter that can be verified with the authenticator's public key. By doing so, the social media profile and the blockchain identity are paired. Once done, that individual can be a registered authenticator for artifacts that are stored on chain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When someone is added as an authenticator to an artifact (only allowed by the owner of the artifact) their reputation goes up. Only the owner can refute authenticity. Refuting authenticity will downvote the reputation of an authenticator.
When someone else is added as an authenticator on an artifact that you have authenticated both individual's reputations go up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A crucial detail is that only owners can affectively up or down reputations of verifiers. Owners want their artifacts and, by proxy, verifiers to have good reputations so their artifacts are more valuable. Game theory helps everyone with this system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also worth noting that signatures could be placed on linked in etc... If someone is new or has a low reputation an owner can always require that individual to submit government id in addition to their signed social media to be absolutely certain they are who they say they are.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Two devs working with metamask, the twitter api, and node. Two devs working with remix solidity, and metamask.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also integrated the Bloom sharekit and POA!
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    web3js weirdness, the twitter API being a bear, the need to sleep.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a team we came together quite well. Most proud of the teammates. Also proud to have learned a lot and be a competitor in this hackathon.
                </p>

                    What we learned

                <p>
                    More about solidity, web3js, Twitter API, that hackathons are fun!

                    What's next for B.C - A.D (Block Chain Artifact Database)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Put it into the public domain. Tracking these sorts of things is for society. Archaeological artifacts belong to humanity, not in someone's home.
