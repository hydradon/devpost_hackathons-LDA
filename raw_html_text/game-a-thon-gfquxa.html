                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by thinking of certain websites such as Miniclip, where there are multiple games on a website. After this, we thought of certain games that we could make to put onto this one website. This led us to our project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a website with two games on it. One game is like a flappy bird game, and the other is a math flashcards game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used different languages such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Atom in order to create our certain games and put it onto our website. The HTML was for the website, and the rest was for the games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our brainstorming took the longest time because we did not have many ideas on what we could do. After about an hour, we finally found certain inspirations to help us find what we are doing. Also, we had a lot of trouble in our JumpingSquare game, because it was hard to get the square to move as a result of pressing the arrow keys. Getting the spikes to work in the game also was a struggle because it took a lot of time to make it work properly.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of actually incorporating the games onto the website, and making the games work after the struggles we went through.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there are many hardships we face when coding, but if we keep working hard, we will be able to find the problems and get passed it. Our teamwork skills and collaborating skills were worked on and improved during this event, and we our determination to finish helped us complete what we started.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Game - a - thon!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will add multiple games and incorporate different levels and increase the difficulty of the levels. These will all be included in our website to make the experience playing way better.
