                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most fall sensing devices on the market require the push of a button to notify authorities. Over 40% of Geriatric care patient falls are due to unconsciousness, so traditional devices would not work.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wearable Watch that detects a fall and sends a text to an emergency contact through a companion app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the CurieIMU library in the Arduino 101 (Tiny-tile) to grab Gyro and Accelerometer data to determine a fall. Then we connected the Tiny-tile to phone using the built in BLE to send a text message to a emergency contact.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Transfering data over BLE was harder than we expected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Calibrating the device in various different conditions was also hard.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to reduce our false positive rate dramatically over the course of Bitcamp 2017.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Intel Curie platform is a powerful all in one platform for IOT projects.
                </p>

                    What's next for FallNotice
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the fall sensing algorithm, encryption and adding a visualization dashboard.
