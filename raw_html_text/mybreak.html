                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lunch is never enough. After nearly 4 hours of pretending to write code and copying from StackOverflow every weekday, 30 minutes just ain't it, chief. I needed a way to extend my lunch break - but WITHOUT my boss finding out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    myBreak implements a unique functionality, bending the laws of time and space to give you 45 minutes of break from 1:00pm to 1:30. Then, quick as lightning, it catches back up by 2:00pm, and no one's the wiser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is built using JavaScript and Node.js, and it runs on FitbitOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Manipulating touch screen was a challenge that was initially difficult to tackle, but EventListeners prevail! I was able to hide elements from the screen with simple taps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is my first app, and the fact that I can use it to get a few laughs is wholesome.
                </p>
