                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Just try to imagine such a common grocery store where you usually spend a lot of time on staying in a queue and waiting for all the customers to pay for their purchases. Quite a waste of time!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    What if you can just come to a market, identify yourself, and that&rsquo;s basically it! Now you are free to choose what you want to buy, just take it from a shelve. No more waiting since money for your purchases will be automatically charged from your bank account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are using RFID tags and readers which were kindly provided by both Stora Enso and Siili teams. They help us to detect if a certain product is still placed in a shelve or a customer decided to buy it.  All the data on customers&rsquo; actions is stored in a server and processing there in real time. Then the information about chosen goods will be sent to out IOS application, which allows you to see what you currently have in your basket.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main problems were related to using Kinect for users identification.

                    How difficult and challenging it can be to translate an interesting idea into reality.
