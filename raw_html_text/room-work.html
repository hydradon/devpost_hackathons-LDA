                    Inspiration
                </h2>

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Our website provides such type of design inspiration to people who are not sure which color or design to use to redecorate or build the rooms of their house!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code> We built it using HTML as well as planner 5D, a website that allows you to design rooms virtually. 
</code></pre>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <pre class="language-nolang"><code>At first, we wanted to create a virtual reality room out of scratch but then we later realized that it is way too complicated and confusing to do so we used planner 5D instead. If we were given more time and guidance, we would have been able to create a platform where the user can interact instead of just view.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to learn how to create a website as well as virtual reality rooms! It gave us an eye-opening experience on how fun coding could be and we wish to continue coding in the future!

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use html and other resources in order to create a visible product.

                    What's next for Room Work
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If we were given more resources, we would install a scenario where the user can interact and design their own rooms and customize their wallpapers.
