                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a father of two kids and a Finance graduate I've been surrounded by minds eager to learn about money for years, including my own. We live in a world where being knowledgeable about money is important and will help ease some financial challenges throughout life. I think starting early to help kids build a strong financial literacy background will help them be more comfortable about money and the values that relate to it as they grow. I also generally like teaching and helping kids learn with technology. As a developer of other educational apps I know how beneficial and helpful technology can be as a teaching tool for kids. With this skill I wanted to provide a simple but challenging easy to use tool for kids learning about coins in the form of a quiz. Despite what some people say, I've learned that a lot of kids(and adults) enjoy learning subject matter through quizzes, trivia and tests. I was also inspired to make this coin quiz skill because of one of my favorite mobile apps I've developed, Professor Piggy Bank. The Professor Piggy Bank app has received thousands of downloads and has also been used in various classrooms.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill has several questions about the four main coins used in the United States. Questions are mainly about how much each coin is worth, how many coins it takes to make a specific amount, and the amounts that happen when you combine different coins. To begin just ask Alexa to open or start &ldquo;Kids Coin Quiz&rdquo;
Each game consists of five multiple choice questions and each question has four available answers. Each answer is spoken by Alexa as 1:, 2:, 3:, &amp; 4:. after the question. Simply respond with the number of the corresponding answer you choose.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this skill with spreadsheets, green tea, and also with the help of various Amazon Alexa skill development guides.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making sure the skill responded to asking it to repeat a question and also starting a new quiz.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the skill and having it pass certification! More specifically, I'm glad that I was able to get the skill to ask different questions from a long list I created within each five question round without repeats. I'm satisfied that I was able to make an educational skill that has quick in &amp; out compatibility. I'm also proud to have released the first educational Alexa skill about money for kids.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that it's possible to make an engaging educational voice skill that's easy to use but also doesn't have to take up a lot of time in order to be beneficial.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Kids Coin Quiz
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to continue adding new questions, give the skill more personality and maybe eventually incorporate different difficulty modes.
