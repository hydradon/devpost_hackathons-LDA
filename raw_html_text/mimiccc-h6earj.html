                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by what we thought we could do. We all have a background with Dungeons and Dragons and Tommy has a background with GoLang. We worked together to tie it all together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a simple bot that responds to commands introducing new players to concepts from D&amp;D.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We started out looking up how to create a discord bot, and then found a freeware github on discordgo api.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally wanted to make this more conversational, however, we couldn't make a scanner work properly to read the next line in the discord server via GoLang. We also ran into an issue storing variables for a longer time, we eventually got around this, but it didn't leave us enough time to implement the database we wanted to use.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a working Discord Bot. Its using GoLang.
