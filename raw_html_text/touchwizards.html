                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Games with split screen multiplayer are currently few and far between especially on mobile and we wanted to bring that experience back  , so we built Touch Wizards a game where you can grap your pal and challenge him into a wizard duel
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Play as a wizard who casts deadly spells , you get to choose from 3 different modes :
Single Player ( vs Ai ) 
Local Multiplayer 
Online Multiplayer (work in progress)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TouchWizards was built using Unity and C# , we using "Dotween" for UI animation , Unity Collab and github for collaborating and trello for task management
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When we started developing Touch Wizards , we had something in mind for it . However,seeing the market , we tried to incorporate some features that we thought will help our game pick up the market . Soon , we realized that this resulted in an overloaded game with no clear goal.We had to drop out some idea and think carefully about the core features of this game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TouchWizards was our second game .The feedback we had from our first game really helped shape this game and avoid past mistakes . When we started working on the single player mode , we had no idea how the enemy should react . We had to imitate the player movements and actions and try to take each scenario into consideration.This game paved our road into the world of artificial intelligence .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through the development of this game , we learned more about task and time management. We built our first AI ( Single player mode ) and learned to manage external libraries and assets and integrate them into our game
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TouchWizards
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are planning on expanding this game even more by adding an Online multiplayer , more characters and boosters
