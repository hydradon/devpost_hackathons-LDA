                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Personally I have experiences issues with keeping track of my medical information that is spread across multiple portals. I wanted to create an application that consolidated all this data into one coherent format and location
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This app scrapes web portals the user gives the app access to too collect information and then parses said information. after parsing the data can be read by the user in formatted organized tables.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app with a node.js back-end and an angular front-end. We white boarded our pages then bare boned the entire site. From there we touched up everything with css and html tweaks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into the challenge of data security, while we do not have time during the hackathon to address these issues in code, we came up with theoretical ways to protect users and their data. By encrypting data base data   and following NIST security protocols data, in theory, is safe from being stolen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of the final product we produced. A lot of time and effort went into out UIs and UXs, We asked multible people to review out designs to make sure they would be accepted easily by anyone attempting to use the application
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the importance of user feed back and planing ahead, we ran into a few issues when we jumped on designs or bugs as we did not communicate fully.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Global Medical
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next we would like to fill out our data as we have barely scratched the surface of the information we can collect for a user. on top of usability we want to update our app to be able to handle and help users stuck in disaster areas.

                    Notes
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We attempted to use the url
                    <a href="http://medical-global.net/" rel="nofollow">
                        http://medical-global.net/
                    </a>
                    but domain.com failed to update their pointer so we were forced to use my personal url
                    <a href="http://alexboyle.net/" rel="nofollow">
                        http://alexboyle.net/
