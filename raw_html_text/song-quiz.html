                    Our uses were the inspiration for creating a Song Quiz subscription. We have an amazing community of loyal and eager players who provide us feedback and suggestions, and they have been asking for more songs and new playlists. We wanted to create an experience for our super fans that gives them access to premium content and a VIP experience.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We added support for Amazon Alexa's ISP to our skill code.

                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were keen to test different subscription offerings in order to determine which would be most loved by our players. In particular, we wanted to learn which price point and content would be most appealing. However, this became a challenge as it meant that every test needed to be released as a separate ISP product, meaning separate names, visuals, descriptions etc. Furthermore, we built logic to identify users who were eligible and not eligible for a subscription, and it took some work to be able to present the correct ISP product, at the right time, to the right user.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are very proud of the complex upsell system that we created. Our players are presented with a specific upsell message, with a specific backing track and messaging, depending on the music playlist that they previously chose. For example, if a user has just played 2010s Pop, they will hear a messaging that let's them know that our subscription contains an exclusive playlist: 2019 Hits. This system allows us to target our users in a highly personalized way, ensuring that they hear an offering that we believe they will be interested in hearing more about.
