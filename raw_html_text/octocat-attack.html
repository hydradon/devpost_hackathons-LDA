                    Supposed to implement VR to judge reaction time

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used unreal engine and the oculus rift to create it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did not have any experience with the oculus, and very minimal with unreal engine. And we had troubles with sleep and exhaustion
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make the player 'hit' the octokitties when they light up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Be more prepared with what software you want to use before coming to the hackathon.
