                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Voice assistants like Amazon Alexa are changing the way we interact with technology. After Smart Home, media consumption and many everyday life helpers we are now thinking of next-level voice applications that can help in a very important industry: Health Care. With "Eye Exam" we bring one of the first pilot projects for that industry on Amazon Alexa.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users are presented a series of - so called - Landolt rings. Every ring has an opening to a specific direction. Rings get smaller over time and according to the progress of the users the skill calculates a acuity value. With this value the skill will give users a recommendation and tell them if they are likely to wear glasses or if there acuity value has changed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built Eye Exam with the Jovo framework. We're using AWS lambda for our Skill backend and serverless for the  deployment process. With the excellent debugging suite of the Jovo framework and the APL authoring tool we were able to streamline our development process and were able to take part in the challenge (as we have decided to free capacities of our everyday work on Christmas eve).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Users without screens can not have an outstanding experience on their Echo devices. Therefore we decided to use Contact Permission API. We're offering a PDF version of the test that we send to the users via SMS. So they can do the test on a screen device like their laptop or tablet computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A pretty neat development and testing workflow that we have setup to work in a team together on this project. We had the chance to talk to a professional optician and learned how eyesight tests work. We have a bunch of ideas how to improve the skill and add premium features to it. We want to create a healthcare suite for voice assistant users and get the most of every device type!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FireTV devices with Alexa can be connected to many different screens!  :-)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Eye Exam
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A hearing test for users without a screen, FireTV support, Red green weakness test and other test that are related to your eyesight &ndash; last not least: Having fun while creating voice experiences for Amazon Alexa.
