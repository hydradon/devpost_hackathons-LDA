                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The WHO estimates that there were 285 million visually impaired people in the world, of which 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind. Of those who are blind 90% live in the developing world. People living in the developing world have access to technology which can be used to solve their day-to-day problems. We built a product for these 285 million people - View.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    View is an Arduino powered device that has a sensor to detect proximity to nearby objects. When there is an object nearby, the sensor causes a vibration motor to go off. A visually impaired person should be holding this motor in their hand, or keep it in their pocket, so that they feel the vibration and can know of the object that's in front of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since our aim was to keep it as simple and low-cost as possible, we used a minimalistic approach using an Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, and a mini servo motor. We used the Arduino IDE to code the functionality of the motor whenever there were changes in distances.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Arduino code as this was one of the first hardware hacks that we'd ever done.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Build hardware from separate materials, use devices that were available to us from the MLH hardware lab.

                    What's next for View
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Create a mapping system that detects heavy fluctuations and tells visually impaired people safe places of where to walk.
