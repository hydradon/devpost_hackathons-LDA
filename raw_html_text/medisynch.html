                    We met each other today and we start to do a brain storm, he told that a few days ago his grandfather finish in the hospital fighting for his life because he forgot to take his medicine and all the family was worry about that.
After talked with a doctor, she told us that most of the people don&rsquo;t progress in their treatments because they don&rsquo;t take the medication correctly. 
So, we found the solution developing a user friendly device which allow the administration of pills in a simple and effective way for the old people.
We have two parts in this system, a digital platform in which the doctor prescribes to his patient the medicine by quantity and frequency and the patient would have an alarm every time when he has to get his medicine. After to confirm by fingerprint that he took it, the doctor and tutors will have it log, but if he doesn&rsquo;t take it, the person who take care of him receive a notification in order to control him to the correct use of the drugs.
On the other hand, we have the device that always gives the correct pills without any risk of confusion with another pills and guarantees us that the drug was taken at the correct time.
This system is going to contribute positively to improve the quality of life of the elderly people as well as their loved ones or family members who care for them.
