                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To create a math and physics calculator to assist students by showing a step by step explanation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The calculus portion of the program takes in an derivative equation and the program outputs a step by step explanation of the process. The other parts include the solution to common physics concepts such as forces, energy and projectile motion.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was built using eclipse.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into countless amount of challenges during the process. Such as coming up with logic behind calculating derivatives and implementing the derivative rules.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Although our program may not be fully implemented, we are still very proud of everyone who worked on the program and it took a lot of effort to have created what we have right now.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about how much effort it took to create and implement one of these calculators. We also learned about our abilities to come together, share ideas, and work as a group to try to create this program. With this experience, we were able to delve deeper into the concept of Strings manipulation.

                <p>
                    To perform limits and integral calculation, implement the math portion of the program with the physics portion.
