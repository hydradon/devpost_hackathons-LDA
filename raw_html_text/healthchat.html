                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's an app inspired by realizing the need for a chat forum for patients who want instant consultation from doctors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a chat forum that allows patients to chat with doctors regarding their problems. It has been developed both on Android and iOS. It also includes a map that gives the address and directions to hospitals in the patients' city.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Android Studio And built the database on firebase. The database for iOS has been done on parse and its front end on the iOS developer platform.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard incorporating the chatroom exactly how it was meant to be in a question and answer form, and had to settle with a message format.
                </p>
