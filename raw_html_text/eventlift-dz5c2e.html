                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Multiple times we have wanted to attend an event, but had no way to reach it. For every one of these times, someone had one empty spot in their car. Connecting people attending the same event allows them to share the road, cut the costs and enjoy the ride with like-minded people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EventLift is at its core an event manager - people create events and share them with others. What distinguishes it from other event managers is the ability to create
                    <em>
                        lifts
                    </em>
                    - car rides that can be shared with others. Members are able to join those
                    <em>
                        lifts
                    </em>
                    , cutting costs and getting to know people attending the same event.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the backend in Flask, using sqlite3 for the database. The front-end uses jinja2 as its templating engine, and we used Bootstrap framework to provide a responsive website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As most of the team had never worked with Python or Flask before, there were some difficulties relative to the lack of experience. Working with Bootstrap was also new to the majority of the team, which required some adjusting period as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having a "finished" working product, a MVP, was a goal of ours since the beginning and being able to achieve it feels very satisfying to all of us. The ability to adapt to the new technologies in such short time period is also something we are quite proud of, as we have been able to get the project working, even if not following every good practice.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Besides the technical skills related to the used technologies (in which we had virtually no experience), we also learned a lot about project management skills, working as a team under a tight schedule.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for EventLift
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Making it a safer website, adding security measures, would be the next step. In order to implement an MVP with the core functionalities, this part didn't get as much attention.
