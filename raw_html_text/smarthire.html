                <p>
                    Hiring the right employees is hard. Most large companies have many departments that may not interact with each other very well. We aim to facilitate that and make the hiring process easier for the employer as well as the applicant.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project has several components.
                    <strong>
                        Andoird App
                    </strong>
                    The recruiter uses the app to take a picture of resumes from potential applicants. This picture along with some extra information is then stored on a database for later analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Server Side Analysis
                    </strong>
                    The sky is the limit here. Right now, a python script reads the database. Then machine learning gets the text from the resume and categorizes this. In the future this can run any machine learning algorithm needed, such as tf-idf, knn, or any other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Recruiter Website
                    </strong>
                    After the career fair (or whatever the case may be). There is a website that queries the database and returns the relevant results. The specific details of this depend on where the database is hosted, but with those details this reduces to a solved problem.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We build the Android app using android studio. Currently, all of the server side analysis is done in python. The website is also generated using python, but his could be done using php or javascript depending on the actual deployment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, none of us are web developers so learning the necessary technologies to do that was very time consuming. We also struggled with interfacing to the database. Finally, this was a large project to complete in the time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Make sure that the projects can be completed in the time frame allotted.

                    What's next for smartHire
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interface with the database needs improvement. We can also make a better webpage.
