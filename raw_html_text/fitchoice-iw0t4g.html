                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many athletes do not achieve sound nutritional practices to optimize their sports performance. There are many factors that include dietary extremism, poor practical life skills, reduced access to food due to a busy lifestyle/frequent travel, and most importantly poor nutritional knowledge that are detrimental to peak sports performance. Education in nutrition for the athlete needs to be practical, so as to address eating strategies and key food and fluid choice s that will help to achieve the goals of sound nutrition. Strategies that are easy to use and can achieve a number of nutritional goals simultaneously, like FitChoice, are the most useful because athletes often find it difficult to integrate separate issues.

                <p>
                    FitChoice is a mobile menu scanner application that harnesses nutritional data to optimize meals based on an athlete's preferences. The app allows users to tailor their fitness goals based on their own aims such as muscle building, maintenance, and fat loss. FitChoice then suggests the most optimal meal plan before, during, or after workouts based on the three big macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
