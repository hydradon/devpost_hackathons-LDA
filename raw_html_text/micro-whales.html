                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration sprouted from the deep interest of games. The ability to further empower the experience of gaming led us to create a decentralized cryptocurrency transaction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Micro Whales serves as a third-party platform for game companies to charge users for micro-transactions within their respective games. Implements the Hedera Hashgraph and uses the HBar cryptocurrency.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized Hedera Hashgraph sdk directories to process these fast, varying transactions, which is difficult to achieve through the use of blockchain alone.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The prime difficulties we've encountered were the implementation of Hedera sdk. We've started in Java eclipse IDE but due to difficulties with the installation of Mavin, we were unable to access the sdk within Java. Therefore, we compromised using GoLang, which is very simple in terms of sdk importing, to finish up.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've striven further than anticipated with the manipulation of blockchain technology, as we had little to no experience with using this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned a profound understanding of blockchain technology along with the hashgraph variation. Along the way, we learned GoLang in order to finish the project.
                </p>
