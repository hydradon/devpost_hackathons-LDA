                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have that friend that never pays us back. I can't name him here because he has devpost. But we all wanted a way to keep track of that friend, as well as our own debts to others. There are many available services, but they all require a subscription fee to use. That's why we made UOMi.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UOMi allows you to keep track of money you owe and money owed to you. You log into the service using your google account, then you have the ability to add transactions between you and other people. These transactions are kept in a log and summarized for you to easily keep track of them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used MongoLabs for our database and Heroku for our server. Python with Flask-PyMongo was used for all the backend processing of transactions and user records. On the front end, HTML/CSS/Javascript was used in conjunction with bootstrap to create a clean, responsive UI.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was our whole team's first full web development project. We had no idea how to set up a database, work with the backend, and communicate backend information to the front end. We didn't even know the difference between relational and non-relational databases. After overcoming this learning curve, we had issues with the nuances of the languages due to our experience. Our final greatest challenge was getting Heroku to cooperate with us, as it simply did not want to update. In the end, however, we were able to solve the issues we faced to create this application.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of putting together this entire web app. We were able to overcome every challenge every step of the way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about web development, especially on the back end. We also learned some of the key advantages of various database types and what types work well in what situations. We were exposed to the many small nuances of the languages we worked with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for UOMi
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We already have a connection established to the user's Google account, the next step is to use it. We want to give the user the option to notify people who owe money to them via email. As well, a mobile application for Android and iOS would make it quite convenient for users to track their finances on the go. We want to expand the functionality of the app to be able to automatically track split bills and create group payment tracking.
