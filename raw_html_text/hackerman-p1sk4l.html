                    ) but isn't actually all that convincing for people that actually know coding as it is in a browser. The idea of this project was to create a similar thing that was more convincing due to having its own dedicated terminal and looking more overall realistic to a power shell. This way it could possibly even convince someone more techsavy that would be able to see through Hackertyper.

                <p>
                    From this we learned that natural language machine learning wasn't the best choice for trying to create randomised but convincing looking code. We also learned how to use a keylogger in python and whilst it wasn't successfully implemented we also learned a fair amount of GUI in python (using tknter).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To take it further we would want to finish the GUI and also add more languages to the program to allow the "hackers" to "hack" in the language of their choice. Taking it as far as possible we would also have a go at making a neural network to implement the random code generator and see if that would work better.
