                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was inspired by many different games, including a game wh.ere the goal was to not stop moving, aswell as many roguelike games such as Legend of Zelda.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game about a lost (and armed) Roomba trying to find a way out of the coal mines.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We used some pathfinding algorithms for enemies in Processing, and read Image pixels to load levels. It is tile-based, so production was quick.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -It was the first time using pathfinding and we didn't know where to start. We didn't understand anything that was said online so we made our own way for pathfinding
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We are proud of the large world we built, aswell as loading levels by reading images.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We learned that we should keep track of the time more, and be sure what you are doing before you code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Disorientation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -We plan to add usage to the inventory items and add many more enemies and attacks
