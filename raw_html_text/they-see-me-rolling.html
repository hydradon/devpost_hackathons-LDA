                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make a car that moves in a smart manner - not just in four directions, but actually based on the things around it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It moves and avoids obstacles! It can also detect motion sometimes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used an arduino wired to motors and a servo that rotates a proximity sensor. When the sensors detect something nearby or motion, the car will reposition itself to actively avoid motion in that direction.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had much bigger ambitions in the form of hooking up a raspberry pi, and a cozmo, but many technical difficulties stopped us. Furthermore, debugging faulty wiring, etc is always a pain.
                </p>

                    We will figure out the raspberry pi inputs!
