                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was trying to go to hackrice last weekend, but could not go there since it was flooding then. I was unsure about the road conditions on the way since I was driving on my own, and I did not want to take chance. So if there was something from where I could see most recent pictures of road conditions and live information, it would have made it easier to decide.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It gathers weather information (photos, description) from crowd and displays it if someone is trying to know weather condition of that location. It is not fully built though. Since we were only two and arrived late, we could only work on backend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using Node.js, express.js, mysql, aws-s3, aws-rdbms, html, css.
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Figuring out how to store uploaded images
Integrating backend and frontend since we tried to work with totally new technology for us. We tried to work on react-native first, but could not figure out.

                    The idea itself. 
Although we could not implement react native, we learnt a lot about how it works.
Could implement the idea on backend.

                <p>
                    Learnt about AWS-s3, react native.
Learnt how backend works.
