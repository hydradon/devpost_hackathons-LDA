                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some people struggle to buy the right materials at Home Depot and this is designed to fix this.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A tool that assesses your budget and gives you a DIY project with links to materials from Home Depot.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    DIWhy is a web application. For our backend we used Node.js and used webscraping to get the projects off of websites, and extract the products from the home depot website. For front end, we used javascript for the design
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Home Depot does not have a public API so we had to resort to web scraping. Also, the Node.js asynchronous request libraries did not work very well
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    How we fixed our bugs

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Asynchronous libraries are difficult to implement
                </p>

                    What's next for DIWhy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will incorporate DIY handbooks to our project list and use an API instead of web scraping.
