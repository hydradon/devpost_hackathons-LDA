                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by current events going on in America. We want to alleviate the fears and judgments people have and transcend boundaries.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app matches users randomly regardless of ethnicity, nationality, and gender. Once the users meet and scan each other's unique QR code, they can unlock the ethnicity, nationality, and gender of the other person (or find out by talking to each other).

                <p>
                    We used Android Studio and Git to develop as a team.
