                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by rising plane ticket, baggage costs and wasted space in suitcase to create an app that would help people make money, save space, save money on their overall traveling costs. It would also allow for cheaper and potentially faster delivery of goods.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever someone is traveling, they can find people who need to send something abroad and can utilize extra space in their luggage to deliver the product for them. The traveler will get paid for delivering the good by the individual. The app serves as a medium to unite these two parties together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it using android studio. Making the app required knowledge of java and xml that we utilized.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges. The major challenge we ran into was connecting activities together. We had been up since 4am trying to get it to work. We figured out the problem just in the nick of time 6+ hours later. The issue was that the images weren't called on correctly, which wasn't allowing for the activity intent to work. Therefore, it kept crashing the app when the button was clicked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of being able to spot errors, problem solve and critically think our way out of disastrous problems that we encountered in the creation of this application, We are also proud of being very creative in coming up with this solution to a very relevant problem in the modern world. We are also proud of the team effort and co-operation that was put into this project by all team members.

                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot of new skills and were able to brush up on our critical thinking and problem solving skills the most.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Luggr
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on doing a release once we have a stable application that can be put out for a public release. We also plan on getting it out for the other mobile operating system (i.e. ios) and we also plan on making a web platform as that will help us reach an even wider audience.
