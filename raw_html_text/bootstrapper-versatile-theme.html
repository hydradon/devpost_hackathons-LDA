                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We received our inspiration from looking at website design templates, and noticing nothing that countered to the needs of a hacker of software developer who might need a full website to display his skills and achievements as a developer
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project effectively and professionally displays all your achievements in a nice material design way. It uses a fade in fade out technique to do this along with displaying ur date and brief description of the title
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being a novice coder, we managed to build this with heavy HTML, CSS, and a slight amount of javascript and php. Furthermore, we also encoded it from scratch using a basic text editor along with w3 schools for most of the syntax and sample code
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many challenges in our project. For Example, our php sender for a contact us form refused to send from a localhost and only decided to want to work when uploaded to proper online hosting. Another one we had was the padding for the hackathon development boxes. Each one was extremely hard to align right along with it staying the same no matter the phone size or position on website
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the many accomplishments that our team was able to pull off was the animation using javascript. Having no prior coding experience in javascript, we looked at some syntax on how to do transitions and attempted to implement them. We soon learned we had no idea what we were doing, and after 2 hours we managed to get working transitions wherever possible in the website to add an extra sense of professionalism
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the few things were learned included the use of javascript and how it pertains as integration into html websites. We also learned how to autoscroll to specific parts of a page using js
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HackStrap: versatile theme
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to make a whole lineup of themes that are specifically designed to upcoming hackathoners or small time software developers. We hope to make these themes free to use for anyone and inspire the hackathoners of the future to share their current and previous coding projects
                </p>
