                    One liner: We need a system for AI consensus on the Blockchain to ensure that what AI systems are seeing, doing, and deciding is verified by consensus. They can&rsquo;t be hacked or make even honest mistakes.

                    In the next 5 to 10 years AI is going to be increasingly interwoven into our lives and into society. It will drive us to work, pick up our kids from school, cook our meals, and could even kill people through drones. When our society becomes so dependent on AI the potential of a hack or just honest mistake in programming to harm millions of people or make their lives miserable. Messing up with these systems will be as simple as creating a computer virus and it could bring the deaths of millions of people and disrupt entire economies.

                    The Blockchain prevents hacks by verifying a key against a consensus. We are extending the traditional Blockchain Consensus capability by building into it AI Consensus to ensure integrity of every AI system.
