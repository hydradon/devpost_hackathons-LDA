                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We loved the idea of having a stadium of people holding their mobile phones and having them changing according to the music played.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Flash displays color patterns according to the song being played in a concert.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a python script to play the song, and used Numpy to do a Fourier transform on the audio and hashed it into a color. Then it is pushed via Websockets to the client and displayed on the browser.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js doesn't have a good FFT library, while python flask didn't work well with multi-threading. So we used the python script to pump data into Node.js, which then used Websockets.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to connect a program written in two languages and made a real-time WebApp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>

                    Which libraries are good for which purpose
                </p>

                    What's next for Flash
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Add different patterns to the graphics and make the syncing better.
