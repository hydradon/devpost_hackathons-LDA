                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration came from a zombie survival/Hide and seek type of game.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Zombies" or NPCs are spawning across the map and the purpose is to avoid being caught by these characters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Unity and hours of googling.
