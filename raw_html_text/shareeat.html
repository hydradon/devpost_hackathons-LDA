                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like to eat home-cooked food, and when we do not have the energy to cook, we would love to buy affordable home-cooked food from someone. This app enables us to do that.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It lets people share home-cooked food and the app enables user to know how long ago the food the was cooked, how far the person who cooked it lives and also lets the users rate each other.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used iOS Swift as out programming language, Parse as the database, and other functionalities from Eureko pod and GoogleMaps API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -- We had many git merge conflicts which we learned to solve as we built the project. 
-- General build errors in swift which we were able to solve too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    --The app as a whole is very functional and the UI is very user-friendly and neat.
-- The functionalities we used were not like any other we used in the past so we were very happy when it all worked as planned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    -- We learned that small problems like git conflicts can take up a lot of time 
-- We learned that we need to have the requirements and picture the view controllers before hand and divide up tasks so that we will save time later when working as a team.
