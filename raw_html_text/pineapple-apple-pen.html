                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often times we find ourselves in a situation where we need to sign a receipt or document, but our hands are dirty, or it would be unsanitary to touch the document.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pineapple Apple Pen allows a user to sign their signature in the air, without touching anything.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was built using a Leap Motion to detect the location of a user's finger which they can use to sign the pen.
