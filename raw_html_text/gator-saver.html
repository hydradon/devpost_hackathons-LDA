                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College students are known for bad spending habits. Binge purchasing and browsing amazon, while possibly intoxicated, could result in an unprepared loss of funds, leading to unforseen consequences.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our proposed system is meant to help students, and anyone in general, with online spending habits. With both graphical and voice interfaces, the system is meant to assist the end users by finding them cheaper options to items that the end user would like, stops any purchases that the user could not likely consent for given a certain level of end user intoxication, and rewards the end user with allowing them to transfer set allocations of spending money over to the best cryptocurrency at the moment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system was both hardware and software intensive; on the hardware side, sensors such as the muse EEG reader headband and the Leap motion sensor were integrated, and on the software side, various "front-end" work was completed, including data visualizations using javascript frameworks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Some of the largest challenges faced were integrating all the hardware, making sense out of collected data, and then utilizing the data in making purchasing decisions. For instance, the battery in the muse headband seemed quite faulty, as its bluetooth connection with computers would often fail.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Researching and implementing a system that is able to determine whether or not a person is intoxicated, from brain waves, was quite exciting. Being a team of electrical and computer engineering students, we have very little exposure to electrophysiology within our course curriculums. But, with sufficient amount of prior knowledge and enough research, it was quite rewarding to implement such a potential breakthrough.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a whole lot about integration of hardware and software, as well as electrophysiology, specifically while interfacing with the muse headset.

                <p>
                    A feature letting multiple end user calibration is at the highest priority for the further development of this system.
