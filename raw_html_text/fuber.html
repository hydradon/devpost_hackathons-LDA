                    <li>
                        You want to attend a Facebook event on the other side of town, like a party or concert, but you don't know anyone who's going.

                    <li>
                        Your only option: take an Uber by yourself, there and back, and cover the entire cost on your own.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We've been there! It really sucks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fuber gives us budget-strapped college students a second option. First, it connects Facebook event attendees located nearby each other. Then, it sets a central meeting location so that they can meet up, hail an Uber, split the fare, and save some money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    $8 rides suddenly become $2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That handles going from Point A to Point B, which was our original plan. But then we also decided to address an entirely different issue by handling the case of Point B to Point A. Driving under the influence claims the lives of thousands of Americans every year, including many college-aged students. Our application helps to mitigate the likelihood of drunk driving in 2 ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you're arriving at the event by Uber, you won't be in a situation where you can drive home on your own anyway. So, we hope to encourage college students to take Ubers to events more often with the added incentive of splitting fares and saving money.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Upon relaunching the app, a singular, large button reading "Take Me Home" instantly hails an Uber from your current location to a saved home location.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Android Studio and lots of caffeine.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We use Facebook Graph API to fetch a list of events the user has on their account and populate an event list view.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We use Google Maps API to draw the map of nearby users and the group selection screen, as well as the meetup activity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Through Deep Linking with Uber's API, we're able to redirect users to Uber with their pickup location and destination pre-loaded into the application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We also use the fair estimation endpoint in Uber's API to display in the Group Standby screen the amount of money you'll be saving with that trip.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Developing Android applications is quite difficult to do collaboratively within the time constraint of a hackathon. Most of the time we were struggling with version control, moving code around, and adding new modules to our central build.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Amongst other things, our project name is a triple entendre. Yeah.
