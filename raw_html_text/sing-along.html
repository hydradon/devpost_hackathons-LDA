                    The thought came to me when I realized how amazing it would be if people were to have normal conversations with their chat bots and received normal replies had it been a conversation between two people.This is my second hackathon and I really wanted to give one the projects a go.

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am using dialogueflow which is connected to my google account. The entire project is run through the google assistance bot.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A few problems I ran into was first over writing an intent, having to change training words so it does not overlap, and forgetting to make an intent.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I mostly proud of the fact that I was able to complete my project. I was also proud of the fact that I was able to quickly get the grasp of using dialogueflow.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned the operations of dialogueflow and how to create actions and assign already defined actions to different words to signal google.

                    What's next for Sing along
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This project was made as a nice way to lighten up someone's day. Hopefully if anyone feel like enhancing it to make it ten times better that would be awesome.
