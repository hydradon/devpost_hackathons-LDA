                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Games are fun. Games in which you can compete with your friends and take their lunch are even better. Why shouldn't we provide one, so you could enjoy?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game could be described as
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            side-scrolling shooter
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    . You need to avoid obstacles (including your friend), collect meat and get points - how many? More than your friend, as it's all about the rivalry.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have developed ideas, coded in C#, created graphics and put it altogether in Unity Engine. Our cooperation was supported by Git through GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A complete game in less than 48 hours? It must be well designed then. We've been doing our best to grant the best gaming experience possible. The Internet connection wasn't always as good as expected, which raised synchronisation difficulties. We needed to plan each one's role not to get in someone else's way. We also had to overcome obstacles that technology presented to us, master our tools.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've made a
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            good game

                    </strong>
                    - that's what we are all sure about. Proffessionally looking, with
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            awesome graphics

                            addictive gameplay
                        </em>
                    </strong>
                    based on rivalry, set in Krak&oacute;w, with dragons as playable characters. And
                    <strong>
                        <em>
                            sheep

                    </strong>
                    , don't forget the sheep! It simply works.
                </p>

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've learned how to solve our problems in team, improved our skills in Unity and C#.

                    The sky is the limit! This game is ready, but we've got plenty of ideas, that can make up another good games.
