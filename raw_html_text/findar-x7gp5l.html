                <p>
                    With augmented reality being the next frontier in mobile apps, we wanted to build a game with AR. Our main intention was to keep the game simple, light, creative, fun,
                    <strong>
                        offline support
                    </strong>
                    and versatile across any age barriers. We made FindAR, mostly pronounced as "Finder".
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The game requires the gamer to look his environment through phone camera, identify targets in augmented reality and select. The game will be clocked and the gamer who gets all the targets within the said time wins. As an added advantage, user can play any levels in offline too and then can sync with online and get updates once he is back to internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As simple as that.

                <p>
                    Build an application on the mobile platform that's simple, creative, engaging to multiple age groups and uses futuristic concepts. Supports offline.
Driven by the passion to do small things in a great way, we concluded on building FindAR.

                <p>
                    We started the development and went about building the code base. That was the usual part. The Fun part was when we started testing our code in offline. We created quite a buzz roaming around the halls pointing out cameras. People invited themselves to try out the game and were excited when we set about tweaking the AR objects.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>

                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being the first time into Mobile development, the very first challenge was setting up the Dev Environment with tools. The conventional Android Studio ended up being too heavy for our simple minds. With more exploration we found Viro and life became easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Property Propagation
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had successfully added the AR Screen to a Viro box and was able to see the object in AR. However, for our we wanted to select the object and pass on the state to the header which was running on React-Native. After 1 sleepless night and a bit of Viro tutorial, we found out how this needs to be done.
                </p>

                    <strong>

                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We succeeded placing the objects randomly on the AR screen but slogged around fixing them in a required position. Our game plan was to view the objects in AR and commit its position to mind and when requested think back to where the object was displayed. Fixing up the 3D coordinates was a mandate.
                </p>
                <p>

                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The AR objects had to be bundled up with the app making it heavy. Imagine loading 36000 objects required across all levels loading when the first level is loaded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3D objects required the Spotlight parameters to be perfect for pristine visibility. This was over-burning the app, making it slower.
