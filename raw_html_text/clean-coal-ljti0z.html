                    Inspiration
                </h1>
                <p>
                    A desire for open exchange of data/information to improve overall usage and adoption of solar/battery technologies.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What it does
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Makes real-time decisions of optimal behavior for controlling solar/battery/grid energy.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    How we built it
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Using real historical data from commercial buildings, PV generation, and battery behaviors. We integrated these into a webapp built in python.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Scoping, depth of subjects.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Specing a robust software architecture with naive models in 8hours. Providing a flexible architecture that adapts to variety of assumptions/strategies.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What we learned
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The most complicated aspect of these integrations is the Battery management. As was mentioned several times today "the science isn't there yet", so this is a huge difficulty and opportunity for machine learned improvements in behavior.
                </p>

                    What's next for CLEAN Coal
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Web deployment, more dynamic models, more sophisticated learners, forecasting integration, business model.
