                <p>
                    Most people I talk to don&rsquo;t have a reading strategy. They just pick up something and start reading. You want to get something out of it. You want to learn things that you can apply in your life to grow. That&rsquo;s the whole point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, you can devour 15-minute summaries. But it&rsquo;s doubtful you'll digest Jobs' true philosophies or actively become a successful professional overnight if you spend 15 minutes reading the key points. Such techniques are useful for dinner party conversation, but the truth is, if you really do want to re-structure your life, I&rsquo;d recommend making the time to actively read the work.
                </p>

                    Booke is meant to assist you in delving deeper into your reading experience and help you squeeze the essence out of a book. Your own essence, not somebody else&rsquo;s.
