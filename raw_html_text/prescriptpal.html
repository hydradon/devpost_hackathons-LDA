                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pharmacist friend spoke about her experience with deaths caused by doctor prescriptions (mainly incorrect dosage). We decided to do something about it.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Digitises prescriptions (allows patients to take photo of it and scan it in) and provides database for specific drugs with all the information you need about it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Node.js and Express.js for the backend and hosting. openCV for detecting the barcode and HTML/CSS for the front end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Webscraping for the first time was difficult as a lot of pages did not allow you to extract information. Integrating the front-end and back-end was also a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
