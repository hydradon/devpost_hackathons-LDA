                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Volunteers or anyone looking for a quick and easy way to get out and help the community or anyone looking to make a little extra money on the side.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built an app that helps connect people in the community by giving those who are looking for work or volunteer opportunities access to those who are looking for people to help out.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed this app using InVisionApp and iOS Swift with Firebase for our authentication and backend handling
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many many challenges when trying to built this app. The different levels of coding that each person knew was definitely a setback. Trying to implement a person's idea to your own idea was also very difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The amount of work that we were able to accomplish with such little time and the amount that we were able to learn leaves us with no regrets about the competition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that making something isn't as easy or fast as it seems. There's definitely more that goes along with the pretty picture than just what's shown.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for GoFor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GoFor helps to be able to bring about this app to the community. This could be done by first giving it to high-school students and allowing them to test it out so they can get their community service hours for school.
