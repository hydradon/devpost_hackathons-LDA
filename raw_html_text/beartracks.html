                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a group of college students, we really wanted to try to do something that would help fellow students plan an academic path that is both enjoyable and effective. Furthermore, we wanted to provide students of all backgrounds the opportunity to learn about majors and classes that they might not have much knowledge about.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In short, our website helps students plan their academic careers by making different class recommendations based on major requirements, prerequisites, and (of course) the students' preferences. Students input their major (or a major they might be interested in) and are presented with a graph
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to build the foundation of the user interface and then used JavaScript to add some fun animations and incorporate the graph database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Visual output of our graphs, parsing ambiguous course  pages programmatically, hosting the graph database, including classes with no pre-requisites in our graph.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to split the tasks based on everyone's skills and knowledge. Furthermore, we were able to build a web scraper that checks for prerequisites for each class and class information. This way, students can find classes that build off of previous courses or are topically related.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to use search functions and how to link webpages together. Also, graph theory! :D
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for BearTracks
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'd like to continue building BearTracks by adding additional information to each major's individual page. This information may include what jobs you can get with the major, related interdisciplinary classes from other majors, or estimated courseload for each class. Using NLP to aggregate classes, and group them by labelled categories.
