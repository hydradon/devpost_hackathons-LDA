                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the idea of holograms that we could touch. We wanted to make the virtual as physically real as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Haptic Touch gives users of Leap Motion physical feedback when they touch objects in virtual realities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into challenges when trying to find ways to merge arduino controlled feedback with events that happened in the virtual reality of Leap Motion.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to interface with Leap Motion as well as how to create our experiences with Leap Motion.
