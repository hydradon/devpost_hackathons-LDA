                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As a musician, I am always looking for something to give me an accurate pitch, whether it be for relative pitch training or just to sing something for someone. With an echo in the room, now I don't need to pull out my phone to do it!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill currently outputs a random pitch. The idea behind this is specifically for pitch training. Alexa sounds a pitch, and you are slowly training yourself to recognize which pitch it is.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used the Alexa skills kit and the AWS Lambda server to
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't actually know how to code. That was the hardest part. Figuring out what exactly the instructions, samples, and documentation was saying was hard.

                    It works!

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alexa is a powerful platform with a
                    <strong>
                        lot
                    </strong>
                    of options. I want to continue to learn them all.

                <p>
                    Next, the skill will be able to recognize a request for a specific pitch and play that.
