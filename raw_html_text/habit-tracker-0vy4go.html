                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We all have tried to develop a habit. More often we start doing for a few days but don't follow through enough to get a hang of it. It is often recommended to continue doing something for at least 20-30 days to form a habit. Streaks are a very common way to motivate you to continue doing it. When you see the result, you want to keep it up. Thus, Habit Tracker!

                <p>
                    It maintains a streak of the number of days you have been following a habit, but only consecutively.

                    How I built it

                <p>
                    I have not worked with ReactJS so I wanted to learn something on the go while building it. The web app here is solely front end but may use NodeJS and ExpressJS for the server and middle tier and MongoDB for the database.
