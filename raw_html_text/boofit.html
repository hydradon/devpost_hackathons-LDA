                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A research paper a teammate and I discovered during our math capstone.

                <p>
                    It simulates this experiment with the user. They choose how much they want to wager, in exchange for a larger starting amount and then play the game to its conclusion.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Reach-Native, Expo, and lots of patience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    React-Native is its own challenge. We also had to make a prototype and figure out how to pass data between screens and make asynchronous calls to functions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to make a minimally viable product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about react-native, navigating pages and handling data in JavaScript.
                </p>

                    What's next for BoofIt
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the future we would like to make a fully fledged app. Complete with better styling, actual account management and possible cryptocurrency tokens users can play with.
