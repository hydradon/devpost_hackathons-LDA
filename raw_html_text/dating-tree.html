                <p>
                    Our inspiration for this project was how a lot of people do not care about what they do to they environment, and what products they use. We wanted to stop this and help people become more passionate to the environment

                    We built it using CSS, JS, and HTML5, programming languages which none of us have had prior experience with. It was super fun to learn them with the help of mentors and peers.
