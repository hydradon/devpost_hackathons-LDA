                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're a bunch of 4 international students who arrived at UMass last month. After getting here, we met a lot of people over casual and formal events but were not able to keep in touch with them. So we decided to build an
                    <strong>
                        easy
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        intuitive
                    </strong>
                    solution that
                    <strong>
                        shares our social profiles right at the point of contact without explicitly asking for it
                    </strong>
                    .
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The designed solution involves a
                    <strong>
                        wearable device
                    </strong>
                    coupled with a
                    <strong>
                        mobile application
                    </strong>
                    . The app stores all the social profiles a person intends to share with other people at various events. It is at the user's discretion to pick what pieces of information they would like to share with people, depending on the nature of the event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever two people shake hands with each other, their wearable generate a signal marking the meeting. Using this signal, the back end of our solution exchanges their social information and shows it inside their respective apps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have used Raspberry Pi as the wearable to simulate the handshake event. Our back end runs on Python and MongoDB. The mobile application has been developed using the Oracle MAF technology that allowed us to build a cross-platform application.

                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        No open API that enables commonly available wearable devices to pair/interact with each other.
2 . Had to get acquainted with Raspberry pi to simulate a wearable device.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We struggled with the application development part and were not able to add all the features we had originally thought of implementing.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    <li>
                        We were able to develop a fully working, deployable back-end system within a day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A cross-platform mobile application that has most of the features we envisaged in our initial design is nearly ready.

                    <li>
                        Coming up with a good idea is half the job done.

                    <li>
                        The idea grows and changes as you discuss more within the team and with other people.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots! Upgrading our mobile app will be our topmost priority. We would also like to explore this idea with other, more convenient and cheaper hardware options like NFC sensors.
