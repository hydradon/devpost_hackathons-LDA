                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We do what we love and love what we do to be happy and spread happiness. Our team has dedicated our entire lives to designing resources which inspire teens to identify their passions with financial returns being of secondary importance. EnvisionWith.Me isn&rsquo;t an ordinary organization. Our primary objective is to increase the general welfare of the local community. This idea is reflected at EnvisionWith.Me through four visionary values:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        HAPPINESS
                    </strong>
                    We continuously strive to achieve and spread happiness no matter what the status of our visions are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        TEAMWORK
                    </strong>
                    We value transparency within our organization, so there is no leadership hierarchy &mdash; think of us as one visionary family that has passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        PASSION
                    </strong>
                    Simply put, we do what we love and love what we do &ndash; that&rsquo;s why we help teens launch their dreams with genuine happiness and energy.
                </p>
                <p>

                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Here's how we built three incredible versions of Visionary Box:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Cardstock &mdash; Using the downloadable Visionary Box PDF template made in Photoshop, students draw their dream vision on the lid of the Visionary Box. Then, they draw symbols that represent obstacles on the Magic Cube which is assembled along with the Visionary Box and placed inside when complete. These obstacles represent challenges they need to overcome in order to launch their dream vision successfully.
                    </li>

                        , students design their Magic Cube by uploading pictures of real life obstacles.
