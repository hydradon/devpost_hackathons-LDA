                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The challenge was to create a game that uses taping and swiping
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    its a challenging version of space invaders with some good music and sound effects for a better experience.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used java to program most of the game. We used sprites to design it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time programming the aliens and having them slowly move down together.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud of coding a game out of scratch. It is the first time we tried this and the result was pretty satisfying.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to use sprites and include it in a java program.
