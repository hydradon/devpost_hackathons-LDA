                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Public restrooms are the worst. Not only they are hard to find, but public toilets are also dirty most of the time, especially in the bay area. Furthermore, some portion of restrooms, here on campus, are hidden without any directions which gave students and visitors a hard time on campus. The idea behind this is that we wanted to create a platform that could show all nearby restrooms on a map and let users pick a restroom of their choice and give directions to them. Not only that, we gave a platform for all users to rate and review the public restrooms, so other users don't need to experience the unpleasantness of dirty, smelly public restrooms.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First, users are asked to log in using their Google account to be able to access the maps and give reviews. Then, users will be directed to a map of their surroundings with the phone's GPS and it will show all nearby restrooms. Users could then add public restrooms that are not on the map and choose a restroom if they need to go. If they choose to add a restroom, they will be prompted to give a name or short description regarding the restroom's location and it will be pushed into the database. If they need to go to a restroom, they could choose any restroom from the map and it will bring up the rating for that specific restroom and if they like the review, they could ask for direction which is given by google maps.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the application using Android Studio. The main language that we used is Java and we used API from Google Services. Moreover, to save all of our data, we used Google's Firebase as our database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us have any experience working with database and only two of us had experience with Android programming. This whole project is a challenge for us. However, the biggest challenge that we encountered is integrating all of our modules into the main project. We encountered different kinds of errors every time we tried to combine the modules, mainly the database. But, we finally got it together and finished the project.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is our first application and that is the biggest accomplishment for all of us. Although some of us had some experience, we have never finished a whole project from start to finish. Being able to learn how to integrate database into our project is also a big accomplishment for us. This team had been planning to create some applications for a while but without CalHacks, we would never actually start creating.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot this weekend. We learned how to use Google Services: from login, maps, and other APIs. We also learned to integrate the database into our projects and most importantly, we learned how to create an application from start to finish.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for LOO!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of room for improvement. We would like to start expanding our features and give better filters for users that require special accommodations. Right now, the restrooms are not categorized and a clean/ satisfactory restroom for one specific group might not be enough for another group; for example, if a person with a disability needs ADA compliant restroom, then we should be able to give a filter for that. Not only that, but we would also love to expand the application to give users the option to sign in as a guest so that people could skip the hassle of signing in if they are in a hurry.
