                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We originally started with an app that would rate an uploaded picture for attractiveness, but decided to go the more PC route and have it rate websites instead.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ugly and pretty websites are fed into a neural net to train the classification system.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A ML framework was used to ingest and train the neural net and the Flask front end was built to take screenshots given a URL and to feed that into the classification algorithm.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning Python and Flask at the same time while trying to understand ML was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to get training sets and classifications working.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                <p>
                    Improvements to UI and more sophisticated learning.
