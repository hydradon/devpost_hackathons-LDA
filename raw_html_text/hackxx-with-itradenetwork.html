                    Maximize the efficiency of fresh produce distribution is both important for farmers and customers. The work ItradeNetwork does inspire us to come up with a model that can predict the rejection of certain produce order. With the model, we can help reduce the current world issue about food waste.

                    Based on the exsiting dataset, we built and trained a failure prediction model. Given a set of features as inputs:

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We used Jupyter note with Python 3 to process our dataset given by ItradeNetwork. We cleaned the data, take a quick look at the characteristics of our data, created list of features to develop a Machine Learning model. We trained our model with 80% dataset we have and tested with the rest 20% of the dataset.
