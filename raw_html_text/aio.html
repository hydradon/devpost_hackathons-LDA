                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Individual payment cards for all employees mean no more waiting to borrow the company card, or worry about risks of sharing cards.
The integration with Xero allows to export transactions made with aio* pre-paid cards directly into Xero as bank transactions.
Xero's account codes can be used to tag transactions with the appropriate category, so some of the accounting efforts can be handled by employees tagging their own transactions. aio* makes it possible to take pictures of receipts and attach them to card transactions right away. These receipts will be uploaded through Xero's API as file attachments as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were mainly using the Java API provided by Xero, although we partly had to write our own integration to allow the upload of file attachments (receipts) to bank transactions.
Since we are developing in Scala, it was convenient to be able to use the Java API directly and make use of
                    <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/" rel="nofollow">
                        Akka HTTP
                    </a>
                    to establish an easy connection to Xero's REST API for additional services.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating many bank transactions through Xero's Java API was a problem at the time, since we encountered
                    <code>
                        SocketTimeoutException
                    </code>
                    s. I raised this issue on Xero's Java API GitHub-repo (
                    <a href="https://github.com/XeroAPI/Xero-Java/issues/25" rel="nofollow">
                        https://github.com/XeroAPI/Xero-Java/issues/25
                    </a>
                    ).
The introduction of a timeout-value in the
                    <code>
                        JsonConfig
                    </code>
                    made it possible to increase the timeout in order to upload more transactions at once through the API.
                </p>

                    </a>
                    to simulate Xero's API XML-responses greatly helped to run test scripts and automatically test the integration with Xero without the need of valid OAuth-tokens.
Since the Java Xero API didn't provide an endpoint for file attachments, we needed to write our own integration for this part of the API in Scala and Akka HTTP.

                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned a lot about OAuth v1 and how to encrypt requests and set the correct headers for API calls to succeed. The different types of Xero accounts and the best way to sync transactions from our system into Xero.

                <p>
                    aio* wants to help making budget and expense management easier for companies. Being targeted at managers and accountants, the integration with Xero makes our product far more attractive for them.
