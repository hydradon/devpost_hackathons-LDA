                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To learn more about the stock market
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a simulation of trading stocks and helps teaches younger kids about the stock market. It does this by having simple news events that affect the stocks and has limited options for stocks to prevent kids from being overwhelmed from having too many choices.

                    <li>
                        Only two people knew how to use Unity, and only three people knew C#
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many bugs and numerous null pointer exceptions
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Everyone learned a little about C# and Unity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pretty nice graphics

                    <li>
                        Have most of the logic implemented, but we had trouble displaying the results on the screen

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Game development is difficult
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Front-end development it highly difficult as it involves combining so much data together
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Teamwork is important
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How to organize code classes and the hierarchies
                    </li>

                    Hopefully, we will be able to finish this to make it playable
