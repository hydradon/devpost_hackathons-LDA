                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to make a game that could interact with the player in an interesting and fun way.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a game that gets angrier as the player progresses. It tries to hide the continue button as the player keeps clicking it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used XCode to build this game for iOS. I used all the basics that the software provided.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to figure out smart ways to connect two different screens in an interesting way. I had to channel my creativity in order to finish this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I could make it stylish. At first, it was plain text on a screen. Now, it has color to it and looks better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how app development for iOS works. I also learned the similarities between different phones and the ways to code for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Continue
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I really want to extend the game into more intense levels. I also want to add in some animations to add to the fun.
