                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TutorSwap was inspired by students who wished to help others in exchange for being helped.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TutorSwap uses information given by the student to discover matches for them, letting them tutor someone else in a class they have already completed with a high grade, in exchange for being helped with a class they need help in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TutorSwap is built with basic css, html, and javascript, using images created in Adobe Illustrator.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Initially we tried to use Firebase (the real-time database), but we decided to switch to Firestore (which was recommended by a Googler). However, this proved to be too time-consuming, so we moved to creating a simpler website that still conveys TutorSwap's ideas and goals.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TutorSwap is built of a team of four, two of who are first-time hackathon goers! Each member on our team has had to go through their own obstacles for creating TutorSwap-- from trying to animate .svg files to getting a database to properly store user information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our experience through TutorSwap taught us that creativity is more important than skill--which took us 8 hours trying to use a database to figure out!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for TutorSwap
                </h2>
                <p>
                    TutorSwap aims to maintain its purpose of providing users a platform to exchange tutoring services. In the future, we plan to deploy a full service and incorporate multiple schools so students not just from UC Davis, but from other universities can also benefit from each other.
