                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, there not many good free music applications - Spotify, iTunes and Soundcloud all require you to pay for better service. We solve that by downloading the music from Youtube instead of the user buying the music from our servers.

                    Streams youtube videos via their URLs for personal enjoyment.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this app using node, react and firebase as well as github for version control.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into many bugs which were mostly due to lack of experience and bad practice e.g. not indenting properly, not commenting and not committing often. Another challenge we faced was using firebase - this was our first time using databases of any kind, so we had to ask the mentors and refer to the documentation quite a bit.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're all very proud that we were able to learn a lot of tools (node, react, firebase) in such a short time (24 hours). While the app isn't very functional, it's the first step in learning.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned many fundamental react.js concepts, such as components and constructors, as well as learning about how good practice can help benefit our code. We also learned how to read documentation, even when the documentation wasn't very clear. Another thing we learned was how to work effectively as team and resolve conflicts between team members. Last, we also learned how to debug errors using the developer console.

                    What's next for FeelTheWave
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, there's a lot of bugs for FeelTheWave which should definitely be fixed. In addition we should improve the UI to make using FeelTheWave easier. Long-term, we would like to transport this to a desktop app, perhaps using the Electron framework.
