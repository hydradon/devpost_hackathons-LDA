                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I like to learn things, so I thought I'd learn a language. When I tried to use Duolingo and Memrise, I found that though they're good for teaching vocabulary, they lack the flexibility and the manpower to teach a language completely.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    LLearn provides a couple of important things: first, an easy-to-use platform for people to connect with one another, and second, an easy way create lessons that include interactive components like audio and quizzes through a series of HTML tags whose functionality is implemented invisibly to the user by Angular.js, allowing them to focus on content.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You know... I typed symbols into a light box until it did my bidding.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Angular to make the custom directives do their thing was tough, but that was also 4-5am, so...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stayed awake, consumed like 400 mg of caffeine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Angular only allows one root tag in their templates, and if you have more than one, they return an error that looks like it comes from the JS instead of the template.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for llearn
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't know. I'll probably keep working on it - I want to continue with this concept of better, more semantic HTML, and I like Angular, despite all the headaches.
