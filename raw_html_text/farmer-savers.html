                    SHPE Hackathon: Build A Farmer&rsquo;s Future

                    With recent increase in problems of abuse, neglect, and dangerous work conditions for its employees in the field of agriculture, organizations are uniting their forces to find solutions to improve the health monitoring of farmworkers. The mobile application aspires to keep track of the worker&rsquo;s activities and responsibilities they must fulfill during their work hours. One of the main features of the app includes monitoring and recording the breaks that each worker is takes throughout the day as well as pushing notifications to remind them if a break has not been completed in over a certain amount of hours. The app will also serve to check off people that have completed their morning meetings, check in and check out their times in the field, and monitor their daily activities while at the fields. The app will have comparison of data, data that can be retrieved from several other built in sensors of smartphones such as accelerometers, heart rate sensors, and temperature sensors, in order to verify that farmworkers are not cheating the system and are actually taking their breaks. It will also analyze the data and approximate the amount of water that workers should be consuming if there is to be an increase in temperature that might require a higher intake of water.  Along with the app, the crew leader will have access to the responses for each worker, and he/she will be held accountable of making sure that workers were actually doing what they logged in the app. The creation of a profile for a crew member should require that he/she is CPR certified, and it will allow the crew member to access the information about the breaks of each worker. This will keep track of which crew leaders are certified, and it will allow crew workers to take care of their assigned groups. The app will also be able to keep track and keep record the general area that his/her workers are working in which can help ambulances and supervisors locate any worker that might have been injured. Some challenges that might arise include: malfunction of sensors, overestimate of daily amount of water a worker should consume, taking the crew leaders and farm workers accountable for being honest with the information they log in the app. The app will monitor essential information required to maintain a safe environment for farmworkers while keeping record of information required by other organizations like OSHA and the farms.
