                    Concept
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea behind ecoPath is to find the most eco friendly driving route between two locations. Google maps can show you the fastest route to drive, but it can't always show you which route will save you more fuel and reduce your impact on the environment. Using information about speed limits, traffic lights, and route distances, ecoPath calculates the fuel consumed for an average car to help you make more eco friendly decisions.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Execution
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We constructed a network of roads which represent major routes in throughout a section of Calgary's North and center. Major intersections between roads are represented by dots. Using left and right click, you can select 2 nodes for the program to navigate between. ecoPath automatically suggests 2-3 possible roads which you could take between two points and prioritizes paths which minimize CO2 production.

                        Moving Forward
                    </strong>
                    As development continues, the system could be integrated into Google Maps as a plug-in to increase ease of access and allow the program to focus on the fuel consumption calculation rather than on the mapping components.

                <h2>
                    Goals
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ecoPath encourages users to reduce their emissions and pick the most eco friendly route to their destination. It is simple to use and could be integrated into municipal and provincial incentive programs to reward citizens who reduce their emissions and encourage usage.
