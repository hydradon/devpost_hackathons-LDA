                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many people tend to silence their alarms. Instead, this app will help those types of people get out of bed with a challenge.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app will send a text message to the input number with a complex string. It will then continuously call this number until the user sends a text with the exact same complex string.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the Twilio API through python along with Java and Android Studio.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing the out and in-going calls along with setting an actual designated alarm was challenging.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    The code overall works on local and actually functions.
