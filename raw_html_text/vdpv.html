                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really wanted to use the latest technology to make something for the people who are not able to use as much as we do. We always wanted to do something good for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our cane is a good integration of hardware, software, and a simple but portable cane. It is made especially for the blind population. It has sensors and rumble motors that help the blind people know that there's an obstacle near them and vibrates the cane in order to alert them. Not only does it tell them that there's an obstacle in that direction, but the intensity of the vibration helps them to know how far is it from them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from the cane, we made a software using AWS that identifies objects, people, their expressions, and other stuff and reads them to the blind people. The main idea is that the software will be on their glasses (with a camera) and the speakers on the end of the glasses that sit on their ears.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this cane using an Arduino Uno, an Ultrasonic sensor, a buzzer, and a ruler (for the prototype). We connected everything at the proper place and put the right software into it to give them the most accurate results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make the software...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We did run into
                    <strong>
                        a lot
                    </strong>
                    of challenges while doing this. We didn't have all the hardware parts we needed to make it and it couldn't be arranged in such a short time. For the cane, we had some random spikes in our results for the distances of the nearest obstacle which was not really the right way to direct people. It was confusing to solve it, but we were able to solve this issue using math.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We after making it all feel really proud by just typing this and successfully completing a project in such a short time. We feel prouder knowing that we are doing something good for society, and we definitely know that it's going to make a lot of people smile and live their life better.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that making something good for the people which changes their lives significantly isn't impossible. Working in a team 24X7 was not challenging to us because we really were motivated to make this possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for VDPV
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was a prototype for the cane and the glasses. We have a lot of more features to add to this by which their lives won't be any different to the people who are not blind.
