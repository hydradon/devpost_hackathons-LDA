                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired to build this project out of the need to multitask during your morning routine.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our smart mirror allows you to view current weather, time, news, social media, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We begged homeless people for their cardboard boxes... got a random people to buy nail polish remover for us... and web built this mirror.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Supporting the monitor in the unit was one of the biggest challenges!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through research, we were able to find a cheaper alternative to an observation mirror, mirror film, which can cost hundreds to thousands dollars. We are also proud of our engineering feat: being able to support a monitor on top of multiple cardboard boxes and spacers.

                    <strong>
                        WE LEARNED THAT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING IF YOU BELIEVE IN IT ENOUGH!!!

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan to refine this product and put it on Kickstarter.
