                    It wasn't hard for us to come up with a solution countering the inefficiencies in the lives of farmers around the world. We proposed an app that would calculate the most optimal conditions for harvesting and present it to the farmer in a simple, clean interface.

                    STORY
                </p>
                <p>
                    We set out to make a presentable, yet informative app that provided the most accurate of data sourced from the top Weather APIs. The project was inspired by the insane losses that farmers suffer on a day to day basis. We made the project with Android Studio and fetched OpenWeatherMap APIs, some of the most reliable. Since it was a simple app, we wanted to provide farmers with extremely reliable and accurate information that they can use to capitalize on their profits.

                    CHALLENGES
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first, the openColorBuffer function would not work but we resolve this because it was due to a simple NullPointerException. Next we ran into some compatibility issues. The Android Emulator we had downloaded was in its "P" version. The P android version has extra features, but isn't as compatibile. We had to downgrade the emulator to access the code. Accessing the API was a challenge that we had overcome. It was a difficult task to pull JSON objects from the API and parse them onto an Android device.
