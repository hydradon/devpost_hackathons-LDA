                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built a website to inform people about the effects of plastic and how you can reduce the amount of plastic and overall waste you make in your everyday life.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to center things and make things look the way I wanted to; for example, my footer was not staying at the bottom. I had to consult online resources to help with my issues.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built an informative website in less 2 days.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how I myself can be more conscious than I already am when it comes to plastic production.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Plastic Pollution 101
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to incorporate JS to make it more interactive.
