                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students and staff often want rooms to work in on short notice, and using the room booking system would take too long and would be overkill!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It scrapes the timetable database and finds rooms that are not booked at the current time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ruby on Rails backend, HTML/CSS frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The timetable database was represented very badly! We had help from a mentor to convert it to JSON.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                <p>
                    Coming extremely close to a working demo!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned from a mentor how to view our project from other points of view except that of students.
