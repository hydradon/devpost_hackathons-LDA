                    Women all over the world suffer from post traumatic depression. This api helps them help themselves come out of the trauma. It helps women by giving them motivational activities to do on a daily basis to come out of their depression.
Activities will range from reading a book to going out for a drink. The tasks will progress based on the activities performed previously. There will be an activity monitor to track the progress. The user will answer a set of questions at the beginning so the application can find out what kind of tasks to be assigned to the user based on the users mood and energy level.

                    We will be using php and CSS to build a web app which will have an interactive interface that will be motivational and helpful the victims. The main challenge that we face as we build this application is how motivated the user will be to use the app.

                    Being able to create an app that is primarily responsible to maintain sanity and happiness of individual is something that we are really proud of. We have always known the problem of gender equality exists but on analyzing it on this level, we think an application like this is essential and we believe that our app can help a lot of traumatized victims.

                    The next step for Be Happy would be to include a portal where the user can directly interact with a professional to get help with the next step as she tries to come out of her trauma.
