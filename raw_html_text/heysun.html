                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As students we all find that we had a common problem of waking up on time and abusing the snooze button. With HeySun we attempted to address this issue by using friendly competition and monetary encouragement.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Every user sets their own alarm time. The amount of time that passes before the alarm is stopped is recorded for each user. Based on the amount of time passed, the user loses a proportional amount of money. The friend in the group with the least time to stop the alarm gains the money lost from the rest of the friends.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used react-native to create a mobile app. All components were made from react-native's preexisting libraries. Node code communicates between servers to transfer money using ilp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using interledger to send payments, we realized that we needed to communicate with the moneyd server on the mobile app. As there were permissions issues with sending money, we were tasked with getting around them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were able to create a functioning front end app using react-native
                </p>
