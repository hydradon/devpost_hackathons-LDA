                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to Experiment with some Hardware and chose a Pinball table as a fun Project for this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has two paddles to move the ball arround. They can be controlled by two Buttons.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With some Arduino compatible boards from Infineon, two servo motors and a lot of Stickers.
                </p>
