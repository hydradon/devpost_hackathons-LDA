                    Justin Laughlin noticed the problem that there are not very many places for people who create music in a DAW to upload their music for feedback. The best option is something like Soundcloud, where people are lucky to get noticed. Our service will allow people in many creative areas (music, photography, writing) to connect with each other and give each other feedback. Creators will be able to receive feedback from people who are as experienced or more experienced than themselves.

The people who will be using Criteekr will be getting a huge boost in their ability, as they will continue to learn every day during their work which making money.

                    Criteekr can also be used beyond the music industry as well, and you will be able to change the way that digital designers, painters, and photographers use their phones and in a way interact with the business market.
