                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's hard to keep track of all the candidates that have already announced their intentions to run for President in 2020. We thought that making a simple, easy to use app that introduces each candidate would be useful in educating voters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app stores detailed information to educate current voters and students about our sitting president and nine popular Democratic candidates. App users can take a special assessment, the VisionMatch quiz, to find the candidate that most aligns with their views. Using a unique, complex algorithm, the app is able to differentiate between each of the candidates to find users their perfect match. Users can then click on links to learn more about each candidate and find out what exactly they stand for.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Xcode, we learned about and applied our knowledge of the Swift programming language to create our app for iOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had no experience at all with Swift before this competition so learning the language while building the app definitely complicated things. We ran into several technical difficulties with the syntax because of this. We also only had two computers that could run Xcode on our team of four, but we solved this problem using a modular online programming solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We take great pride in the innovative and robust algorithm we developed to match app users with the candidates based on the results of the VisionMatch quiz.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about Swift and mobile apps in general through this project. We now feel confident in our mobile software development skills and plan on expanding our knowledge in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 2020 Vision
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We plan on expanding our app to include more contenders on both sides in order to give the app user a broader range of candidates to learn about and choose from. We also will improve our app to feature more information about the candidates natively, as we did not have time to do so due to the limited time constraints.
