                    Inspiration:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We suck at sports!

                <p>
                    It makes sure you never miss a basket by moving the hoop to where the ball is going to land.

                    How we built it:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built using it using garbage! We first drew up a design that we wanted to build. Once we finished sketching, we started seeing what parts we had available to build with. We started building with cardboard that we could find to start making parts while using our Arduino and motors to make sure that everything moved as needed. In the end, everything ended coming together.

                    Challenges we ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team is bad at math so our calculations were not as good as we wanted them to be.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got it to work at the end of 36 hours while Mark Rober took three years to make something similar with darts. We are all community college students so it was a lot of self-taught engineering skills that were learned during the hackathon as well!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We met at Team Formations so we learned about the power of teamwork. Trial and error was another huge thing we learned.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Basket Hacks:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would upgrade our parts so its less garbage and better looking. We want to get more time so we can add another dimension so it can go up and down. We have the math but not the programming finished for the Y plane.
