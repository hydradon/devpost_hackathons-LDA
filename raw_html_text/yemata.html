                    Yemata is a educational platform for blue-collar workers, that enables them to learn at their own pace
                </p>
                <p>
                    What it does
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yemata provides basic educational platform for those who are school dropouts by any inconsistency which they will still engage in attending their education at their own pace by their suitable local language they prefer to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How we built it
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built Yemata with minimal computational power consumption and minimum technical knowledge requirement which any user can interact with. It is built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, firebase, indexdb and NodeJS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were facing some challenges like integrating and interacting with the emulator.
We were also having issue on translating interface languages to Amharic and Afan Oromo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within the given two days we were really dedicated and accomplish the major requirement path of  our app with great team sprite cooperation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we learned
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have take a lesson that dedicated team work is a very powerful tool to achieve anything that we could dreamed of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also we have seen some potential on KaiOS on which it will definitely penetrate the lower class tech market with its easy to build and minimal computational power consumption apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What's next for Yemata
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yemata will proceed to address maximum local languages which are included in Ministry of Education of Ethiopia curriculum. Which almost reaches every regional formal education languages in Ethiopia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yemata will also provide live-bot support in the future which students can ask questions that they didn't understand when they take a class.
