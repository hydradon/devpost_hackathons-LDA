                    Inspiration: A lot of people tend to procrastinate and many of us have a first-hand experience with procrastination. Therefore, we wanted to come up with a program that helps people with their time management.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: Using a timer, a calendar, and a graph, the user is able to track their progress and pay attention to how much time he or she is spending on each task. It serves a self-assessment for the user to later improve based off of their results
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it: We built this as a stand-alone program using java. We used GUI in order to display this program.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into: Our entire pie-chart generator would not work and we had an hour left. It was a real struggle to get it to work.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: Our ability to work together well and as a team even with a lack of sleep
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned: We learned that even through hard times, even the most annoying bugs can be resolved with persistence.

                <p>
                    In the future, we would like to further code the components in the program and develop it into an app. We hope that someday that app will be of use to some teenagers.
