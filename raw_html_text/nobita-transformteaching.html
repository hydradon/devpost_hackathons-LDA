                    <strong>
                        Artificial Intelligence (AI)
                    </strong>
                    , to reinvent the

                    </em>
                    in Singapore. This AI will be used to assist course coordinators to monitor students&rsquo; learning progress and invent solutions to ensure no students are left out in our competitive education system.

                    This AI will digest all information surrounding students ranging from grades to family social classes and learn on respective teachers' feedbacks to come up with the best recommendations to model a student's learning environment. 
Many models can be used to train this AI especially relearning models such as
                    <strong>
                        Gradient Tree Boosting
                    </strong>

                    <strong>
                        Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
                    </strong>
                    and
                    <strong>
                        many more
                    </strong>
                    . This way, every student are being treated with

                </h1>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we build an AI through using randomly generated data and training it using python. Then we created a demo dashboard for course coordinators and parents alike to monitor their child's progress using React.JS. The dashboard will display the relevant information to the respective actors and include recommendations for the student's learning style.

                    Data is

                        randomly generated
                    </em>
                    and hence might not be
                    <em>
                        appropriate
                    </em>
                    for our AI to learn the best recommendation

                    With more time, manpower and resources, there can be possible future improvements that include having a chatbot, more information, significant role parents can take part in the student's learning journey. We sincerely wish that this idea can be fully developed as it has the
