                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In Pakistan especially there is every basic product available in pretty much plenty of standards and
                </p>
                <p>
                    copies; there is no way to tell where the products in markets are substandard or counterfeit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Especially substandard medicines are products whose composition and ingredients do not meet the
                </p>
                <p>
                    correct scientific specifications and which are consequently ineffective and often dangerous to the
                </p>
                <p>
                    patient. Thus a system like this, which provide a platform to verify the products is necessary and a
                </p>
                <p>
                    need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The impact of this project on the industry is that its users will reject the substandard products and
                </p>
                <p>
                    the industries behind those products will have to stop it and be more ethical in their business and
                </p>
                <p>
                    provide genuine stuff rather than counterfeit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It will bring a positive change in society and people can get what they will pay for, instead of getting
                </p>
                <p>
                    copied and fake products.
Existing solutions to check the validity of the products is to check the product labels, packaging and
                </p>
                <p>
                    trademarks but somehow this is not an accurate way. For illiterate people this method doesn&rsquo;t work
                </p>
                <p>
                    at all, and there is no much information on the packaging nor do the labels etc. show if they are valid
                </p>
                <p>
                    and genuine products. The other existing solution is to call the helpline of the product manufacturer
                </p>
                <p>
                    and verify the product, but that is time consuming and requires high resources.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For identifying the validity of counterfeit products we proposed the PRODUCT VALIDATION SYSTEM. The goal of
                </p>
                <p>
                    this system is to create an item verification software which will offer to approve only the valid and genuine
                </p>
                <p>
                    products. This framework will safeguard whether the item is counterfeit or not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The presence of mobile phones is in abundance, even in low income, developing or third world countries, so this
                </p>
                <p>
                    system will provides an opportunity to consumers to check the authenticity of product using SMS text
                </p>
                <p>
                    messaging or via GPRS services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This SMS-based product verification method relies on printing a unique one-time identification code having a
                </p>
                <p>
                    series of numbers on product packs, in form of bar code or QR code. SMS is sent which consist of code to server;
                </p>
                <p>
                    a message is sent almost instantly received specifying whether the product is authentic or fake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This SMS based user friendly system which will also provide some critical information related to the product i.e.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ingredients, manufacturing date, expire date, details about manufacturer, certification of that product, warning
                </p>
                <p>
                    and health hazards related to that product. There will be two major modules of this project:
