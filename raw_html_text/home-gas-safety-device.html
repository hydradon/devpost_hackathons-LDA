                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of our friend does not have Australian standard compliance Gas Stove. If the gas flame is off duet to food overflow or wind than the house could be in the danger of explosion. In other homes where there is Australian standard compliance stove, the house can still be in danger of explosion, should gas leak from the pipes or joints.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It continuous check the Methane (the major component of fuel gas) and close the shut- down the ball valve should the gas presence is detected in the house.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I connected fuel gas sensor, TFT LCD screen &amp; relay module to Arduino. I programmed Arduino to receive gas sensor value regularly.If the gas level is dangerously high it trigger the relay module and rotate actuator clockwise to close the Gas main valve and shut off the gas supply.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Programming Arduino to include TFT LCD shield, Sensor, Relay module.
2) Fix ball valve in timber frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Life saving device that which works an have potential of saving lives and property.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Better way to use Arduino. 
2) Debugging of Arduino sketch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Home Gas Safety Device
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1) Refine the device to make it more versatile and save lives, properties and environment.
2) In Victoria alone, it can save 15 lives per 3 years and save more than 100 seriously injuries. 
3) Include LPG safety in Caravans also.
4) Car maintenance, the device is portable and the reading from exhaust can be taken and compared with other cars to see if there is any un-burned gases. If they are, chances are or piston leakage.
5) Car safety.
6) Anywhere, where there is chances of gas leakage and prevent accident like Maxico Gas explosion 2012.
6) Pollution control.
