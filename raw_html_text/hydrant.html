                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firefighters find it hard to find hydrant when turning out for calls
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It locates hydrants around the area from different pipelines. So firefighters can spend less time finding hydrants and be our saviors
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have a small dataset of hydrants within woodlands and we worked with it. We created an algorithm to show the hydrants nearby from different pipeline and the distance so they can plan the firefighting strategy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lack of data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works and it can be scaled with ease. Its been validated
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hydrant
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inputting not just hydrant data but also hosereel, extinguishers and also AED for paramedic first responders and also members of the public. We all can be a hero with this app.
