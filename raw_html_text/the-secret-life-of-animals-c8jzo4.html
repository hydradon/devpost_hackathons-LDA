                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Video of behaving animals contains a wide breadth of detailed information about the behaviour of the animals. Many hours are spent by zoos, researchers and the public alike looking and analysing videos and feeds of animals trying to classify what behaviours they are performing. With current ML and CV advances, we feel this is a waste of everyone's time so wanted to put an end to this. So far, computer-vision techniques have only been used in ethology tracking animal trajectories and counting animals, but no solution has been proposed for classifying behaviours of animals, which is key information for animal welfare, activity timings in zoos and the like as well as broader biological studies.
