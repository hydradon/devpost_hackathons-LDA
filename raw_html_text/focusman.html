                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I found myself distracted with my phone or other things while watching my class lectures online and realized I would lose a lot of time playing with my phone and not paying attention to the lecture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program tracks the user's eyes using the webcam and when the user gets distracted by looking at  his or her phone, for example, it plays a sound and the words "Focus Man!" pops onto the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used OpenCV cascade classifier to track the users eyes and when the users eyes can not be detected, a sound plays and the words "Focus Man!" will pop onto the users screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While we were working on the program, it was challenging to make the cascade classifier to work as expected. We also had trouble making C++ to play a sound. Finally, putting all these components together was a hurdle too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This program works perfectly as can be seen in the video link and does its job as expected. It will definitely help us focus on our class video lectures  and help us stop wasting time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to work with OpenCV and how to play sounds using C++. We also learned to work well as a team.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for FocusMan!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is to make this an easier program for everyone to use, making GUI.
