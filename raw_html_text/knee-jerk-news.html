                    CNN and Fox control the news cycle, yet they can't follow safety protocols. I found this quite ironic because originally, I was going to focus on the two and explain how although they are biased, they come together for a collective thought.

                    Helps people understand that there are more news sources out there that actually do care about their cyber safety.

                    I deleted my storyboard this morning after spending the whole night finally getting it to look the way I wanted it to :D I sort of fell into this current idea because I realized that it made more sense then trying to explain what I actually wanted to do. Learning a new feature in Swift was also a lot more difficult then I had originally thought, but thanks to the help of a mentor, I came away learning a lot more about the importance of a simple design and working my up, instead of focusing on the end first.

                    While some smaller companies have adapted right away, some still haven't!
