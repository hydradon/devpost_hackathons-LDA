                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this game comes from old MUDs, Multi-User-Dungeons that were often text-based. 
While this program does not have mutliple areas, it is still inspired by these games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Runs a text-based game that places the user as a powerful warrior to fight against Boars, and to seek out and destroy the evil Dark Knight.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using C++, I implemented several classes and files to represent the different enemies, characters, and functions.
This approach was very agile, with many intermediate prototpyes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Originally, the design for this game included further graphics, but due to time constraints I cut the graphics and went solely text-based.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a battle system that could support more than one enemy type at a time
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Completing my first Hackathon!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Text-Based Games can be interesting, and provide more time during a hackathon to focus on gameplay and classes.
