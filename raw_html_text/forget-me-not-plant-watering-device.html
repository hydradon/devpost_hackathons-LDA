                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Household plants have been linked to a number of health benefits, but can also be a cause of stress if you struggle to keep them alive.  Plants can't verbally communicate to tell you when they need water, so it can be easy to over-water them... or completely forget about them until it's too late.  And what about when you go on vacation?  Or that office plant that nobody claims responsibility for that gets watered five times in one week and then left for months without attention...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does

                <p>
                    In steps the Forget Me Not plant watering system.  The Forget Me Not plant watering system can be used in two ways: an active reminder to water your plant or an automatic watering system.  Simply set the device to the preferred moisture level of the plant and let Forget Me Not take care of the rest.  Forget Me Not will monitor the moisture level of the soil and can send you notifications when your plant needs to be watered.  If you are planning to be away from your plant for an extended period of time, simply attach the water reservoir system and Forget Me Not will water your plant for you and send you a notification when the water reservoir needs to be refilled.
