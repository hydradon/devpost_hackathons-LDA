                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When I was watching a local movie(some militant movie) where they generated the
                    <strong>
                        morse code
                    </strong>
                    using eyelids and they decoded it manually. So I thought why don't we capture that using AI. Capturing
                    <strong>
                        morse code
                    </strong>
                    with eyelids is a bit difficult task so I decided to do that with
                    <strong>
                        fingers
                    </strong>
                    and then improve this in future with eyelids. I thought it can help many people to generate morse code with
                    <strong>
                        fingers
                    </strong>
                    in front of the camera instead of pressing the buttons or morse code machine. It can make the work easy and can also help in militant activities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It tries to capture the
                    <strong>
                        Morse code
                    </strong>
                    pattern and detect the character based on the observed pattern. When we run the Morse_code_generation.py file, Your camera will be opened and you will see a blue bounding box. when you press
                    <strong>
                        b
                    </strong>
                    it will capture the background without your hand first in the blue bounding box,  and it opens 5 windows (Mask, Blur, Ori, Predicted, Test)
                    <strong>
                        Mask window
                    </strong>
                    will show you the masked image of your hand by removing the background.
                    <strong>
                        Blur Window
                    </strong>
                    will show you the blur grey image of your hand by removing the background.
                    <strong>
                        Ori Window
                    </strong>
                    will show you the Threshold image of your hand.
                    <strong>
                        Predicted Window
                    </strong>
                    will show the predicted number of fingers opened.
                    <strong>
                        Test Window
                    </strong>
                    will show the predicted text from morse code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you open
                    <strong>
                        one finger
                    </strong>
                    it is small beep(Dot in Morse code).
If you open
                    <strong>
                        Two fingers
                    </strong>
                    it is Long beep(Dash in Morse code).
If you open
                    <strong>
                        Three fingers
                    </strong>
                    it is to start capturing for a new character or resetting the current character.
If you open
                    <strong>
                        Five fingers
                    </strong>
                    it is to Stop capturing and predict the character from morse code pattern.
If you open
                    <strong>
                        Four fingers
                    </strong>
                    it is to add space between characters.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a two-step process. First, I built a
                    <a href="https://github.com/udaykiranreddykondreddy/Morse-code-with-fingers/blob/master/finger_detection.py" rel="nofollow">
                        model to detect no of fingers opened
                    </a>
                    by using TensorFlow 2.0 and a dataset called
                    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/koryakinp/fingers" rel="nofollow">
                        Fingers
                    </a>
                    from kaggle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second step is to generate the morse code. Here the first step is to detect the hand in the video and the next step is to take that and predict how many fingers are opened using the pre-trained model which is generated from the first step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used the background subtraction method and HSV segmentation from OpenCV to detect the hand. Then each frame is sent through two filters one is a grey image and another is threshold image. We will be using this threshold image and pass it to the pre-trained model to detect no of fingers opened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the no of fingers opened Morse code will be generated.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are two main challenges one is to detect the hand
                    <a href="https://github.com/lzane/Fingers-Detection-using-OpenCV-and-Python" rel="nofollow">
                        lzane
                    </a>
                    made it easy for me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second challenge is to predict the morse code from the large no of frames. I solved it by reducing the frame rate and by introducing other things like the start of the new character and the end of the current character. It made easy to capture the hand gesture and predict through the model. And here
                    <strong>
                        zero fingers
                    </strong>
                    played a major role to create the difference between two deep sounds.

                <p>
                    I learned a lot about image segmentation and background substractions method to detect the hand. And convolutional neural networks to detect the no of fingers opened. 
I learned more about Morse code and its history

                    The next steps of this project are to improve the model to make it faster at detecting the pattern.
