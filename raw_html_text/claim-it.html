                    .. were identity and claim smart contracts.
ERC 725 and 735 had been receiving a whole lot of hype for several months, and the first robust implementations were finally starting to show up.
But DApps taking advantage of their promising features were not there yet. In fact, neither were dev tools that would make it easier for the community to take over these new standards and make the most out of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, the missing part was an

                    ERC 725 and 734 for identities, 735 for claims, 780 for claim registries. Studying in depth these new standards made it clear that some issues could already be solved regarding open discussions on these ERCs.

                    <li>
                        identity smart contracts like ERC 725 show to the world your public key
