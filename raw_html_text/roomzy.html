                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being part of the Millennials we are all experiencing becoming young working adults. One of the biggest challenges of growing up is being able to afford housing close to work. However, in most major cities, this is a problem. Housing market has skyrocketed and so did overall cost of living. Due to this many of us will resort to sharing a place of stay to split rent costs. Some may go to the extent of sharing a single room to make ends meet. The problem with this is that no one wants to room with strangers especially if your views and values do not match. To create a better overall housing experience we decided to create Roomzy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Roomzy is a website that allows individuals that are looking for other potential roommates to connect and try to find a place to stay. You would create a profile on the website which asks you to fill out a form that has questions about location, budget, personality, and lifestyle. Based on these responses, the data goes through an algorithm that suggests other profiles that you may be interested in rooming with. Based on these outputs you can read other peoples bio and give them a quick message.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used standard languages to build this website mainly using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also incorporated API's of sort that can read Bios and create similarities as well as an extensive mathematical algorithm to suggest the most suitable candidates.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Many of the challenges we ran into was learning how to have multiple users and programming authorization. Next we had problems with the Google Natural Language API so we resorted to alternative APIs. Conceptually the algorithm we used made sense however implementing it posed lots of errors.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we learned and accomplished a well programmed Login Page. We are also proud of the design of the site. Lastly, we are also proud of the algorithm we came up with because it uses a very mathematical approach and works great.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned to implement APIs, how to code forms with different types of inputs (drop downs, sliders, numbers, etc). We also learned how the authorization process works as well.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Next is adding a couple more features that we have planned and then publishing it to the public.
