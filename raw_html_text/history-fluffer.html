                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Congress recently voted to overturn FCC internet privacy rules. This change means that internet service providers (ISPs) could potentially sell your browsing data to third parties, such as advertisers.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our hack generates noise to fuzz your browsing history. The script (1) searches for random words on Bing and randomly chooses a result to visit, and (2) keeps visiting links on subsequent sites for a random amount of time. This pads your internet history with sites that you did not actually visit, making it more difficult for ISPs and other parties to decipher your preferences from your browsing history.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ISP Floofer is built with Python, using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries, as well as the Bing API.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Through this project, we learned more about internet privacy rules and the effects of FCC regulation.
