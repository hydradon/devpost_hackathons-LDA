                        Whenever there is a huge accident, hospitals run out of blood and citizens are encouraged to donate immediately, but the response is usually too late for the patients and then all the collected blood ends up expiring (blood lasts 42 days).

                    <p>
                        The first problem we ran into was deciding on a challenge. At first we've decided to work on the Chat bot but after 7 hours of working on it we realized that our project wasn't really bringing a big improvement so we decided to have a brainstorming session. After a little thinking a little we decided to work on the City Hall Challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our next challenge was to put all of our ideas into one project and decide witch ideas weren't going to be developed further. After making a plan of what we wanted to do we started coding again.

                        We also learned the hard way that we need to spend more time on the actual project planning and pay more attention to project management methods.
