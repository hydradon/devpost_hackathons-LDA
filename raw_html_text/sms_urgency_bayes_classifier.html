                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Often we receive messages that require urgent replies while on do not disturb and end up ignoring them for hours on end. This creates an issue as an important message that needs immediate attendance may end up going unnoticed for a lengthy period of time. After dealing with this issue for years, we realized it was time to solve the problem. We started thinking about how one's notification system can distinguish the urgency of a text message and inform the user when he has received a text that needs to be viewed immediately. With the help of a more intelligent notification system, one will be able to make sure that important texts are attended and trivial texts are ignored, all while on do not disturb. Such a system would positively impact virtually everyone who uses the do not disturb feature on their phone.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Intelligent Do Not Disturb uses a Naive Bayes algorithm to classify the urgency level of incoming text messages. After a text message is received, it is run through the algorithm and its urgency level is ranked between 1, not urgent at all, and 4, very urgent. The primary application of this functionality is to allow the user to customize his do not disturb settings and set his do not disturb to be overridden with a notification sound when a particular urgency level is reached.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the Intelligent Do Not Disturb by analyzing a dataset of text messages that were identified based on their urgency. Through that, the Naive Bayes algorithm was used and the data was properly parsed. The Intelligent Do Not Disturb is built using pure python.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By working on this project, we learned a lot about analyzing data. We had to write the classifier by implementing the Naive Bayes algorithms, as well as properly parsing the data.

                    What's next for Intelligent_Do_Not_Disturb
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want to try and expand the Intelligent_Do_Not_Disturb so that it can be downloaded as an app through the app store on both android and iOS, and can be integrated into people's lives.
