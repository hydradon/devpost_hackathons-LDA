                    When you have to do your task and finish it you feel great. But, if you do not finish it you should be feeling great for the efforts.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a program which acknowledges your work and efforts to finish your tasks but when you are not able to finish your work in certain time that you specified you we take money from your account and donate to a charity. The amount is also selected by you.
