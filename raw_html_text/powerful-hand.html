                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of using a touchpad or mouse, we want to provide a third option of controlling the cursor displayed on the screen by the idea of motion capture and activity recognition. By simply moving your hand, we will be able to identify where you want to move the cursor on your screen, which improves the accessibility for easier control of the computer. Thus, improving users' experience with their computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main idea is providing the ability to move the cursor without using a mouse or touchpad. We used wrnch.api to process the movement of hand gesture. Using the json files given, we analyze the data and determine if the hand gesture indicates one of the following: cursor move left, cursor move right, scroll up, scroll down, right-click, left-click. Then, the cursor displayed on the computer will be following the instruction given.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We use javascript to build the majority of the program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One difficulty we encountered is that for security reasons, it is almost impossible to control your cursor running on a browser. We had to figure out a way to overcome this issue which took us a while. We also want to provide the ability of real-time movement analysis since the wrnch.api given was to manually upload the video and download it from the cloud. This also took a while to figure out.
