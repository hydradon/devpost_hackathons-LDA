                    Going to the dentist is a pain, finding a reliable dentist is torture, finding affordable care is a nightmare. Planmeca's PlanScan hardware/software sparked our imagination with it's potential for extending the dental care process to outside of the clinic.

                    By making use of Planmeca PlanScan hardware we make it possible for every person in the world to get unbiased feedback on their teeth by experienced dentists while paying relatively small amount of money. Dentists will be able to analyze qualitative teeth data from any place any time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We supply dentists with clients' electronic dental cards containing history of 3D scans and previous dentists' comments / operation logs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clients can choose who they want to review their teeth by balancing the amount of money they are willing to spend and their personal preferences. Dentists can offer their services after clients chose them for reviewing, but after the procedure he's obligated to upload (or person can do it by himself) another 3d scan post-procedure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the client is ready to pay for extra insurance then he will also receive operation feedback from several independent dentists (making peer-reviews for other dentists is a rule).
                </p>
                <p>
                    New 3d scan keeps dental records updated and allows the client to insure their operation by being able to claim their money back based on feedbacks.

                    </strong>
                    We spent most of the first day trying to figure out a way to use machine learning to perform cephalometric analysis in 3D, but it was a very boring time for the designers on the team. We also spent a long time in the development of our final product.

                        A working Demo
                    </strong>
                    Simple intuitive design with code that works. Our idea is something that we would be excited to use ourselves, not just a product made for the purpose of having made something. It's impossible to show the whole usage of the platform (long timespan, waiting for scheduled visits and so on), but we came up with a simulation, that shows how things will work in the future!

                    It's not very reasonable to apply your mathematical background for research of open problems on a hackathon, but crazy ideas combined with mind-blowing software is something where we can expect breakthrough (at least in our own interest).
