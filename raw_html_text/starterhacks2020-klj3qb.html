                            We were inspired by the prompt of

                            , from the sustainability impact statement of the StarterHacks website.

                            We noted that in our own lives how difficult it was to not only buy food to achieve health goals, yet also not overbuy and create food waste.

                            If for the average person, they waste 1 pound of food per week. That equates to 48 pounds of CO2 emissions per year. That is the same as driving 57 miles, which does not even include the environmental impact of the transportation of the food.
