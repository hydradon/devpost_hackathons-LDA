                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    we kept falling asleep in class, twas very bad

                    When our nifty device detects that you have fallen asleep, it YELLS at you.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We hooked up some Arduino components to a pen for a pencil version.
                    <br>
                    We used Python to program a computer version.
                </p>

                        Being sleepy (thankfully we had our pen)
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    Didn't know how to create GUI
                    <br>
                    Little experience in Python
                    <br>
                    The speaker on the pencil made weird noises when it wasn't supposed to
                </p>

                    It works!
                    <br>
                    The GUI looks decent
