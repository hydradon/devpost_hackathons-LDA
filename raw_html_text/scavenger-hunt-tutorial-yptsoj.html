                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a game where people could learn about T-Mobile's self service options and their Team of Experts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Scavenger Hunt Tutorial mimics the HOME tab of the T-Mobile App with green Easter eggs for the user to find.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this game using Gamemaker Studio 2.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to mimic the touchscreen application with the user's mouse and nothing else. I also had trouble deciding what kind of game to create in the beginning and how to incorporate the Team of Experts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I completed a workable prototype in a short amount of time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I figured out how to move the camera view with mouse controls.
