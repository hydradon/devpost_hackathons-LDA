                    It's great to donate things you no longer need. However, it can be a hassle to find where you should go to give your stuffs away.
                    <strong>
                        And that shouldn't be the case.
                    </strong>

                <p>
                    With my simple and straightforward website, you'll be able to see all the nearest donation centers to any given location. Moreover, you can find donation centers for specific donation types, ranging from clothing, food, to books, and furniture.

                <p>
                    I hope that by simplifying the preparation process, more people will be willing to go out and donate what they no longer use to people who really need them.
