                    The design idea for the National Park Rangers was to provide a task list, a map, and a current statuses of a Park Ranger. We reviewed the current National Park Ranger&rsquo;s website for inspiration along with a Washington Post to explain a typical day as a Park Ranger. This project was a three step process starting with our ideas, our low-fidelity, and our high-fidelity. The goal of the design was to have a desktop version and a mobile version for a Park Ranger to use either at their office or in the National Park. Please refer to the Google Docs link for access to the Desktop prototype and the Mobile prototype. Thank you!
