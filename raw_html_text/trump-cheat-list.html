                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Identifying the polarity of speeches about different subjects shows the ideas of a politician about different issues.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The software that we developed get a text file and evaluate it sentence by sentence and says what is the subject and what is the polarity of the sentence with respect to that subject.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is based on C#. It get a text file as input then interact with AYLIEN Text Analysis which is a package of Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval and Machine Learning tools for extracting meaning and insight from textual and visual content. Then we provide statistics based on extracted data
                </p>

                <p>
                    Providing an interface that easily get a text file (can be news, tweet and etc) as input and evaluate it sentence by sentence.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The software is easy to use and copy pasting text into the text file gives meaningful statistics categorized based on subjects.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned

                <p>
                    I learned about secrets behind political debates and how to use technology to provide awareness for people.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will extend the software to extract more information. Then I will run a website that provide information about future political debates that can be only revealed using technology.
