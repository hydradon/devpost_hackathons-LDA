                <h2>
                    I just finished The Office and I really enjoyed it.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It's a compilation of GIFs from the Office, organized by character.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I used HTML and CSS to get the GIFs into the website.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    It was really hard to resize the GIFs and make them look good with each other.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I'm proud of the relatively clean background and typeface, since it's a simple website.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I learned about how to incorporate images into websites and how to organize them.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    I want to make it possible to click on one character's name (without the GIFs) and see all of the GIFs on a separate page devoted to that character.
