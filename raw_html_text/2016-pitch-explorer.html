                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone knows 2-1 is a fastball count, but we wanted to go deeper.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    2016 Pitch Explorer lets you explore every pitch thrown in the 2016 MLB season. You can customize any baseball situation by balls, strikes, outs, runners on base, and more, and view the distribution of all pitches thrown.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the 2016 pitch-by-pitch MLB data available on Google Big Query. We built it using R for data preprocessing and using Shiny for the webapp.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The data was not necessarily in the format that we required for analysis. We had to derive new fields for the variables we were interested in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pitch Explorer is a useful tool that shows lots of variation in pitches thrown depending on the situation, as expected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In a 3-0 count, a fastball is almost certain to come.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for 2016 Pitch Explorer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand to other seasons, and add more variables to drill-down into the data.
