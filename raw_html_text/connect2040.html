                    Connect2040 is a web app that allows members of the Code2040 community to interact with each other. Often, it is difficult to remember speakers or other people involved with the program. With this application, users can find the contact information of members of the community they are interested in. We also allow members to display that they are looking for mentors, looking for mentees, looking for a job, or looking for employees. HR professionals would be allowed in to have access to the untapped talent of the Code2040 family.
