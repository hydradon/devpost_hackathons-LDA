                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to make something smart, fun and cool!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the game setting of dots trying to eat other dots, the player plays against the AI, allowing the AI to train itself and become a master at the game!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Processing 3.4, Java, Google Cloud Console, Google Cloud Platform and shell script.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    No time to train the neural network...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    ...however we were able to set it up. We created computers with the capability to have the network to run indefinitely and train against itself/other players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    EVERYTHING (seriously, we didn't even know how to use Processing before this, or that Google Platform even existed).
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Hungry Dots
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Stay tuned for the sequel...
