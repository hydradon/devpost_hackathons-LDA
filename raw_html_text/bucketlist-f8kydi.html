                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've all made bucket lists before and let's face it, we've never actually gone through with them. But why? We usually just forgot about it...
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    BucketList is a smart bucket list planner that checks the prices of your trip and notifies you when the prices decrease. We use machine learning to find other trips that might be of interest to you as well as coordinate multiple destinations in the same trip.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this using a Flask back-end and an Android front-end.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hooking up the front end and the back end proved to be much more difficult than we thought it would be.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to integrate machine learning into an actual app.

                    What's next for BucketList

                <p>
                    Adding more features for the machine learning and adding a community aspect around the app
