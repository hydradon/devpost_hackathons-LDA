                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We think of some pretty deep things while on the toilet. Being able to share these thoughts and read others' was something we thought was cool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Deep s**t allows you to share and read others' deep thoughts.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to explore Parse. As a result, we focussed on leveraging this backend to store and retrieve our data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parse's documentation was not as detailed as we'd hoped; we often ran into confusion with concepts and this slowed us down considerably.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Being able to successfully finish the hack -- 3/4 of the team were first-time hackers
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Leveraging Parse to store and retrieve data, as well as designing with text-heavy elements and lots of white-space.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Deep Shit
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting our friends to join the platform and share their deep thoughts. Gathering feedback and refining the UI/UX is as well. We enjoy the simplicity -- future features may be in the works.
