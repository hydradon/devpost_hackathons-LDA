                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We came to Junction to participate in the Game Jam, but the nice people from Bankify were looking to make their finance app more interesting and engaging and we thought it would be a cool idea to gamify their app.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GamifyBankify gives a few options of competitive mini games with leaderboards where you can compete against other members of your Bankify groups. Once the dust is settled and the rankings are in place, the amount of money each group member owes the group changes according to the leaderboards, you basically compete for a dew cents every time.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the games in Unity3D, since that is the platform we are most familiar with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    thinking of a way to engage users of a finance app was a challenge itself, but I'm happy with what we came up with.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The whole project was done only by 3 people, and all the art was done entirely by 1 of us (Ester is our hero &lt;3)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to coordinate work between the artist and the developers.

                    What's next for GamifyBankify
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe it can be integrated into Bankify somehow, or at least its ideas.
