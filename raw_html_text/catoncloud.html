                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of our teammates are animal lovers and would love to do our best to help the homeless animals. We want to take care of pets and animals and meanwhile enjoy the companion of them. However, we are all college students so we could not have pet in school. We thus develop the idea of developing a online platform and could help more homeless animals and enjoy the happiness they bring us.

                    We use Ruby on Rails to setup our backend server and database.
We use Swift to develop the front end application.
We call google cloud api.
We use machine learning algorithm to generate recommendation for users

                <p>
                    We met technical difficulty of many open bugs in Swift. ( Swift is just so wierd....
We also brainstorm a lot, trying to figure out how this platform could be the most practical
