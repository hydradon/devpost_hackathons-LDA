                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In order to combat procrastination, our group devised an idea to increase motivation to do work right away even for long term goals. Our app is a social productivity app in which a user signs in via a google account login and creates a task that others can join. When your friend joins and completes the task, you too feel motivated to do the same!
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    This application uses Firebase as the framework to create a productivity application that aims to connect the world. Users will find tasks that interest them and compete with others globally to reach their chosen goals.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into fundamental design issues about setting the proper framework and infrastructure (JSON database).

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our product achieves simplistic and seamless front end implementation as well as technically powerful back through Firebase.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From this experience, we learned a great deal regarding using javascript to access and write database structures. Furthermore, we learned how to structure and design a database and infrastructure such that tasks could be shared and people could be connected. Ultimately, we learned a lot about integrating back end with front end to create a seamless web-app that could connect people even across the world.
