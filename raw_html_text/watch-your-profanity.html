                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In English class, we explicate and analyze poetry. Music is a form of poetry. However, many song lyrics that high school students like have a lot of school-inappropriate words. What to do? How do we get rid of these certain words from the songs?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You give the java program some song lyrics. You give the program some taboo words to remove. The program reads through the lyrics and replaces the taboo words with stars ****.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used my Java skills and used an online IDE called repl.it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Repl.it didn't really work with making project folders and it was a very different style than I was accustomed to. I had trouble the the various conditions to make the project actually more responsive to the user. I also had some logic bugs in regards to having lines get deleted from the final result, and being unable to count with null pointer exceptions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It works 100% and is very cool.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Java skills, mainly.

                    Some sort of web interface that would be seen more frequently on the web.
