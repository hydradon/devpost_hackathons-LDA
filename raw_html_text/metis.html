                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our idea originated from a simple chatbot game that we thought would be hilarious and fun to build. When we went back to the sponsor expo for food after our brainstorming session, however, we were inspired by the vision and insights from some of the sponsors to develop our chatbot idea a little differently. We all know the pain of driving when you're exhausted (and also the risk), so we decided to incorporate our chatbot idea into a driver experience and companion instead of simply a game.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app locates where you are and provide entertainment for you based on that and also your preferences (preset data). It has two main features: explore new places or entertain the driver. 
Our explore new places feature will give interesting insights into what's around their current location while their driving and how far away it is. If the driver decides to go explore it, then the driver can navigate towards the location using our map.
Our entertainment option will depend on whether the driver initially set their car to self-driving or manual mode. With our self-driving mode, the driver can access all the possible entertainment features we currently have: trivia, movie quotes, and international radio browsing. With the manual mode on, the international radio feature will no longer be accessible.

                    How we built it

                <p>
                    We built it using Swift and many of Apple's API's.

                    Figuring out the Speech-to-Text API that is still pretty new (only made available last year)
Trying to narrow down to an idea during brainstorming
Figuring out the chatbot feature and linking that to the app

                <p>
                    So much about the Apple API's and much more about the language Swift.
