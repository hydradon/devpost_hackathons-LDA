                    We implemented a web app that tries to help the patients feel more comfortable when they are at the hospital
We do Sentiment Analysis on the patients in order to know how are they feeling, and try to improve their behavior
We geolocate the patient inside the hospital and we guide him if isn&rsquo;t were he has to be
We have an admin panel for the hospital in order to prioritize them better
