                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Walking around the hackathon, I was amazed at how many people were using Arduinos to run their projects. I decided to make an alternative that had more sensors and was cheaper.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a platform that allows data from all of a phone's sensors to be uploaded to the cloud in real-time and be used to power apps. The sensors that it has include GPS, gyroscope, and proximity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used app inventor to code a small app to take data from the phone's sensors and upload it to Google's Cloud Storage servers, then I wrote a front end to take that data and visualize it. The front end is written with Bootstrap, HTML5, and JQuery and uses Google's Maps, Charts, and Firebase APIs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was hard to get the data from the gyroscope to display properly, so that part took me the longest. I also had to learn Google's Maps, Charts, and Firebase APIs from scratch.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting the database to work well and update in real-time, and getting the APIs to work properly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about Google's APIs, and learned a lot about how to use databases, as I have never used one before.
                </p>

                    What's next for PhoneSensor
                </h2>
                <p>
                    More features, including the ability to manipulate the screen of the phone via the computer, and implementing more sensors.
