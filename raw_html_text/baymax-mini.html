                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create something that both adults and children alike could use in order to help with their medication reminders, and tracking what effects (desired or otherwise) those are having on them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is a mini Baymax, the healthcare companion. He reminds you of your daily medications, the doses, and at what time to take them. A survey helps to do this, and sends the data as a text file into a graph generator. You can also find the different medications contraindications and side effects in here.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Amazon Web services, including the build an Alexa Skill. We used mainly python in Lambda.
                </p>
