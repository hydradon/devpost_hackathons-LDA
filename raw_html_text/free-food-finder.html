                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love free food, and would pretty much do anything within reason to get more free food. However, most of the time we miss out on such events because they are poorly organized, publicized, or announced at the last minute. At the same time, we wanted a way for clubs and organizations to easily increase their publicity. Thus, we created a solution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The mobile-friendly real-time updated page keeps track of free on-campus food events sponsored by clubs or organizations or even individuals chronologically by closest event to the current date. Within that, the users can search for, add future events to the website and even add the most interesting events to a separate favorite list inside their own personalized account page.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Python with Flask as a framework to code much of the back-end functionality, coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front-end functions. We then deployed it using Azure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have never used many of the languages we used for the hackathon before, so learning them was difficult.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing the project and creating a fully functional product.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to program in HTML and CSS, as well as improved my skills in Python.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Free Food Finder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We'll add a GPS tracking function to each event that will estimate the distance to the event from your location as well as predict if you still have time to reach the destination before the food runs out.
