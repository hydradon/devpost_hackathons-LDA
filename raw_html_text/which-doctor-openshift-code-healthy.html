                <p>
                    Allows users to easily create stories with decision-dependent outcomes. These stories can be easily applied to medical and clinical situations.

                    Which Doctor does not stop at being merely a training tool though. Due to the community driven nature of the application, it can become a platform for the sharing of medical practice philosophies with supporting arguments represented as decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, geriatrics is a field of medical care that is very reliant upon patient-doctor relationships and communication. What may be the objectively best option for prolonging life may not be the best option for a particular patient. The philosophy of medical care practiced by a doctor, nurse, or surgeon can be just as important as the execution of the care itself.
