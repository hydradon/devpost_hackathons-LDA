                    We created Tutor.me because we found that there was a lack of communication channels for students to give and receive help on classes at Johns Hopkins and universities across the nation. Tutor.me is the solution; it allows for students to sign up and connect with a network of students taking the class and tutors that can offer assistance. The platform allows students to connect one-on-one with tutors, create group chats for open discussions, and broadcast study sessions for other students to join.

                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We know college students like to work late at night (at least we do). One problem this brings up is that it is an inconvenient time to ask for help, since there are no office hours to go to in the late hours. We came up with the idea to create a social media app that would allow students to easily get help and give help in their classes in one centralized platform.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Ionic to create both IOS and Android applications. We used Socket.io API to create a chat-service. We also utilized the Firebase SDK to handle user registrations and sign in.
challenges we ran into
We are all newbies so we came in with very little previous experience. We are very thankful for online tutorials, which were very helpful (shoutout to Paul Halliday).
