                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration from this came from the idea that anyone&rsquo;s life can be impacted even in times where they feel like it cannot, such as relaxation. We had looked into methods for analyzing a person&rsquo;s health, and the Myo was an obvious choice-- a developer friendly device loaded with features.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The program provides results for a person&rsquo;s activity as measured by the Myo armband. We take the information provided to us and clean it up, we organize the information that the Myo provides and we place only the vital information over a predetermined time into a chart, to understand the implications of these numbers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The backend was made python and Myo SDK, which take the data from the Myo armband and extract the vital information. From here, the results are formatted into an custom file type which is sent to the client side Javascript for analysis. The Javascript then formats the information and organizes it into interactive visuals that are then placed onto the responsive design web page created from CSS/HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The largest challenge was the internal limitations between each language. The Python is not asynchronous, so we were unable to do much with the Python beyond just extract information, for the Javascript, it was hard to create charts that were personalized and were scaled, the javascript is intended to just receive information and spit it out-- this complicated the changes to the charts and attempting to normalizing them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are immensely proud of the packaging and efficiency of the results. We found that we had to go far out of our way to make items such as responsive design, the drag-and-drop format, and the scaled charts. Our final product is one that not only takes the information and is able to label it, but it is also a product that is a aesthetically pleasing design that humanizes the project a little bit, something that is hard to do when working with math and math in computers.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned about skills that aren&rsquo;t necessarily related directly to computer science; yes, we did encounter errors and issues that needed to be debugged, but we also found that it is a struggle to work together when working on a multifaceted issue. Even more than this recognition was the fact that we were able to overcome this issue. Time management was also learned, our time constraints limited what we were able to accomplish, and we take pride in working hard and present a fully completed product. The biggest takeaway;however, was the information that we can make something that is finished and polished-- no matter how many moving parts there are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Myometrics
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next step will be expansion. This is a process that can be used more and more extensively. With each tiny detail that we look atm the analysis is further developed; this allows for us to use what we have made at StuyHacks as a foundation for moving on with further research into how we combine motion and computers to optimize a scenario in which we can use these computers to look as people as whole and understand them.
