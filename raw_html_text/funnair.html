                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Instagram is our most favourite social media because of its visual fundament. Users leave imprint of their personality interacting with Instagram content. We are what we are following. We follow those whom we admire; we like photos that inspire us. Due to FunnAir airlines could become closer to users and offer them very interesting flights. With FunnAir user&rsquo;s hidden dreams come true.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    FunnAir analyzes user&rsquo;s Instagram activity such as likes, following accounts, his photos, etc. to decide which countries, regions or cities really desirable for him. And then FunnAir asks FinnAir and its partners for flight tickets and offers them to the user. We believe that this UX can increase user&rsquo;s engagement and decrease his frustration during travel planning.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have built browser extension that creates the magic button on FinnAir website. User clicks that, authorize by Instagram account and get special flight offers. Behind the shores, our backend uses Instagram and FinnAir APIs. We use not so usual technologies stack: Swift at the backend and Javascript at the frontend.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Suggestions services&rsquo; success strongly depends on their predictability rate. Since we were limited in the time we have coded simple algorithm but in the future, it can be improved and reach 90-95% of success rate.

                <h2>
                    What's next for FunnAir
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The next challenge for FunnAir is improving AI algorithm to extremely increase suggestions accuracy. Also, FunnAir has all needed to go viral on the net :)
