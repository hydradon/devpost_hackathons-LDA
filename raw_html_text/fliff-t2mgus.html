                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever covered somebody for lunch, and then they never paid you back? We have, and so have many others.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Fliff tracks which parties owe which other parties which sums of money, in this case denominated in USDC. Debts can be added at any time, and paid back in full or incrementally.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Painstakingly

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starting too late to get everything done to the level of polish we desired. Right now Fliff is only available on Ropsten, and we couldn't get any Ropsten USDC so we had to use YEENUS. Additionally, while settling a debt is possible from the smart contract, we have not yet implemented the ability to settle a debt from within the app.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a reasonable, but not optimal, set cover of possible hackathon prizes. Solving one of humanity's most vexing concerns, thus firmly cementing Waterloo's place in the annals of history.

                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Start early. Practical applications for crypto projects are fun! You can't code at 2am without making
