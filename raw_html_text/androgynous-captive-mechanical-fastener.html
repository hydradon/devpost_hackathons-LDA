                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am interested in robotic assembly of large scale structures. I am experimenting with making lattice structures that might lend themselves to robotic assembly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a fastener that can connect two identical parts with a simple pull and twist motion
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lots of time in TinkerCAD because I don't have space on my hard drive for CAD software. Will try Onshape next time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D printing mechanical assemblies in one go on FDM printers won't work because gaps cannot be made between components without support material.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A good fit
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    3D printing complicated assemblies takes a significant amount of development time
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Continue development and integrate into my structure assembly
