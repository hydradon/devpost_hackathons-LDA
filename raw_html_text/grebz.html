                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's our first hackathon and we really like this coffee cup. So we decided to make it even better!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It shows posts from Bash.org, memes from 9gag and also provides todo list to help you organized your day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Muki API, C#, Android Studio
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, we decided to shown funny pictures from 9gag, but it's very hard to fit picture with appropriate size and contrast. So later, we considered some quotes both inspiring and funny from bash.org. To make it more organized we create also an additional option to display your daily tasks. It was a long way from entertaining features to the idea how to make coffee mornings effective.

                    Successful delivery and breaking challenges.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly, we were thinking about mostly entertaining features for the Muki cup, but then with time we started discovering more and more ideas how to make this cup better. We are going to verify our ideas together with Paulig  Muki team and continue working on this amazing project.
