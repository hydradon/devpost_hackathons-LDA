                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Games are fun, debugging is not. Here's a game about squashing virtual bugs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a tower defense game, where you squash bugs and buy parts for your computer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java with JavaFX along side our favorite photo editing software, GIMP.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    GIMP sucks with opacity. We used
                    <a href="www.getpaint.net" rel="nofollow">
                        paint.net
                    </a>
                    too.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We managed to actually finish an application in 36 hours.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Rubber ducks are good for debugging, so we added one to Frank's desk. It's not necessarily about the product at the end, but the experience we've had.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Debugging Defense
                </h2>
                <p>
                    New levels, new characters (where's Frank?!?), did the rubber ducky come back, where are all these bugs coming from, and even more when we actual finish the game! Thanks for playing!
