                    for this hackathon was surprisingly
                    <strong>
                        hard
                    </strong>
                    , when we finally managed to find one, we decided to build a program that would let that process be a

                    Lucid Teaming is a way for an ideator to communicate with developers. If you ever wanted some help on a project, or some group members, you can put up a project listing and invite other developers to your project, as well as if you just want to find a project to work on, Lucid Teaming

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using
                    <code>
                        React.JS
                    </code>
                    ,
                    <code>
                        Firebase
                    </code>
                    ,
                    <code>
                        JavaScript
                    </code>
                    , some love and a little bit of cussing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        React.JS
                    </code>
                    and
                    <code>
                        Firebase
                    </code>
                    are something that most of our group members have no experience in. It took a while to understand the syntax of
                    <code>
                        React.JS
                    </code>
                    and
                    <code>
                        Firebase
                    </code>
                    before we could even start working on the project. We also had issues with not being able to find data in a
                    <code>
                        Firebase
                    </code>
                    database as well. For the majority of our group, this is our first hackathon.

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud of developing a base for a team finding program, while it may not have all the functions we had originally thought of, we learnt more about how
                    <code>
                        React.JS
                    </code>
                    and

                        Firebase
                    </code>

                    What's next for Lucid Teaming
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ended up having to leave a couple of things out due to time constraints. In the future, we hope to make it look more appealing, built with more developer integration (Github credentials), and a chat with WebSockets so developers can talk to each other instead of a third-party site.
