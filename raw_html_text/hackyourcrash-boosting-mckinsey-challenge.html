                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We love challenges and machine learning, and this is a perfect fit.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Predicts accident severity given accident and vehicle characteristics. We use label and target categorical encoding + gradboosted trees.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the Python language: Pandas for preprocessing and feature extraction, and scikit learn and numpy for the modeling and prediction. Furthermore, Folium for data visualization.
                </p>

                            Dealing with categorical variables: The variables for this problem were predominantly categorical. Our approach was to combine the techniques of label and target encoding.

                        <p>
                            Dealing with a variable amount of cars per accident: How do we represent sets of cars of differing sizes with the same number of variables. Our approach: target encoding + max,  mean, min (aggregate functions)

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We've been able to cooperate and work with each other, giving our opinions freely and discussion our plan of action without losing our way. This has allowed us to reach a solution, which given the difficulty of the problem, we consider fairly good.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part of tackling a machine learning problem is not always the algorithm itself, but rather the selection and extraction of variables and processing phase.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are very excited to give our presentation and share and discuss our work with other hackers.
