                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Women across the globe are often denied access to reproductive health products and sex education. Our mission is to link the women to the stores so that they can access products, while also providing information about contraception and how to create your own materials.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The application first takes the users location using Google Places Pointer API, then it shows the distance between the closest stores. A user can select a store and access information on products, stock availability and pricing. There are also addition features that provide information on contraceptives and preventative measures.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We programmed in the Android Studio environment using mainly Java and XML
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It was our first time using the Google API and it's very difficult to perfect the interactivity.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We can learn a lot in 24 hours, have fun, and create something we all believe in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Red
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully we can develop it further with various language options, providing tutorials, more information and maybe make the app more user-friendly.
