                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got inspired through the fundraising project "team trees" (
                    <a href="https://teamtrees.org/" rel="nofollow">
                        https://teamtrees.org/
                    </a>
                    ), which aimed to plant 20 million trees around the world by 2020. The preservation of trees is a trendy topic currently, so we anticipated lots of people would currently be willing to plant trees to help the environment.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When people plant trees, they can use our app to mark the location they planted it on our map. A virtual tree will be shown at that location. As more people plant trees, the more the map will be filled. This will therefore encourage and raise awareness for the climate. In addition, users can take a picture of their tree and attach it onto the virtual tree on the map.
                </p>

                    How I built it

                    Frontend
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We build a progressive web app with the technologies TypeScript and React. For the maps component we use Google Maps and for the camera the HTML5 camera component. We made the frontend as modular as possible with reusable components for maximum flexibility.
