                    Inspiration This app is designed to be used as a tool to help nonverbal people communicate through music.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does The user types in the letter of the note that they want to play. Each note is signed a specific letter for clarity. So far we have coded it to play the basic octave for the key of 'c.' We have only the piano sound recorded, but plan to add more instruments with time.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    How we built it We used scratch, which is a drag and drop, block based coding system.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into We ran into a time restraint, so we didn't have many utilities to have different sounds. Also sprite (the movable part) placement was a challenge. With the fact that we stuck with the basic structure meant that the note had to perfectly fall upon the line or space.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of We are proud that we could provide an alternative for communication. We also sent it to an administrator at Maddie's high school, Connelly School of the Holy Child in Potomac, Maryland. The administrator daughter (who is nonverbal) loved using the program.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What we learned We learned great teamwork and leadership skills. We learned how to delegate tasks and stay on task. We learned how to use scratch code.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Communsicate It is at its earliest stage of development. In the future, however, we plan to add more instruments and more keys to broaden the experience and to add variety. We know that some people find certain sounds peaceful and other will find the same sound quite irritating. We want to cater to a large variety of people. We are hoping to broaden the nonverbal language.
