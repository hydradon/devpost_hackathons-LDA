                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I got the idea to write this article while trying to open my first channels, and struggling to decide with who and how much capacity to commit to each channel.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Educate people about the current solutions they have for liquidity problems they could face using the Lightning Network today, the main ones being Lightning Loop and LndHub.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is my first article about any topic ever, and I'm very proud that it is about such an interesting and innovative topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that it is very tricky to write an article with you own thought without rewriting what other have written before.
In fact, I originally wrote a piece about the Liquidity problem in the Lightning Network, and realized afterwards that it was a close copy of this article I had read a week ago :
                    <a href="https://blog.muun.com/the-inbound-capacity-problem-in-the-lightning-network/" rel="nofollow">
                        https://blog.muun.com/the-inbound-capacity-problem-in-the-lightning-network/
                    </a>
                    That's when I decided to do the second part, which I submit here!
