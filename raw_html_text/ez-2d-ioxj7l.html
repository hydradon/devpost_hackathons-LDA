                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Pong is such an immortal games, and the two of us wondered how we could make the game more interesting. Changing the size of elements? Adding multiple obstacles or balls? In further exploring this idea, we ended up creating a very generalized framework that can be used to create a multitude of simple 2D games.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ez-2d allows users to create almost almost any interactive 2D experience using the help of simple conditions and action statements. It is possible to place sprites around the area, set key-bindings, manage velocities and collisions, etc. Anything that is not possible with our version would be easy to implement by going into the code and creating the desired actions. No setup or logic necessary.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The project was built using the .NET framework. The user interface was created using windows forms with VB.NET. Most of the other processes were created using C#. The project included very general classes that encompass the functions of game sprites. The "code" used for customizing games is very flexible, as we were able to parse inputs thoroughly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Obviously, perfecting the parsing algorithms was one of the most confusing and time consuming parts of the project. Some more challenges include
                </p>
                <h1>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The "code" is definitely the highlight of this project, making it different than most game editors. Users have complete control. They can create and save new scenarios on the fly.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Parsing arithmetic expression definitely served to be a huge point of learning. The idea of algorithms such as recursive descent parsing is definitely a complex and interesting topic to explore.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Ez-2d
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the immediate future, we would like to implement quality of life features such as error reorganization in the "code" and more extensive documentation for when projects may get more intense.
