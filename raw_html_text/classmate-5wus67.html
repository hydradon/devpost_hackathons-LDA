                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We realized that many students are willing to tutor classes they&rsquo;ve taken before but lack the outlet of getting their postings out. On the flip side, we noticed that a lot of students would rather get tutored by other students who have aced the class with the same professor already than from a professional tutor. Former students can offer insights, past exams, notes, outlines, and expectations from the professor. So we came up with an idea for a student to student app platform that connects current students to former students who are willing to tutor.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It will pair current students with former students that are willing to tutor. We will use a hash function to scan tutors&rsquo; transcripts and identify their professors and grades.  Then tutors will be able to make postings on subjects they&rsquo;ve aced and provide their values in the description. We will let the market determine the prices for each class so tutors will have the freedom to set their own prices. The app will also offer a comprehensive search engine that will allow users to search by keyword, subject, professor, and price. When the tutee register for the session he/she will be charged for the session but it will not reach the tutor until the tutee presses a session complete button. After the session is completed tutees will be encouraged to leave ratings and reviews.
