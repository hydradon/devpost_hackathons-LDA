                    When Disney bought the rights to Star Wars everyone wanted to know what was next for the franchise. Between movies and video games, people are excited to see what Disney has in store. As gamers we were excited for the recently announced Battle Front game a few years ago as well as a Star Wars game based on a bounty hunter.

                    Shortly after the purchase of Star Wars, Disney announced that Battle Front was on hold. While it has recently resurfaced we have decided to make our own Star Wars game. We present Oculus Podracer. Using the Oculus Rift we are able to put you in the driver seat of Anakin Skywalker's Podracer.

                    Alfred Shaker did the programming for the game mode and Oculus while Matthew Allen did the 3D modeling, environment design and visuals.
