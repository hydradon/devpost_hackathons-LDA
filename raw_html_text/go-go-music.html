                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine going on a road trip with friends. Have you ever experienced the amazement when the music playing from the radio just clicks with scenery around you? We&rsquo;re here to bring you such moments of wonder, and more!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    To find music that fits the scene, users can use our website prototype to snap a picture using the computer camera by pressing "SNAP"; then, users can press "GOGOMusic", and they will be led to a Spotify playlist with music that fits the scene in the picture.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this project using scene recognition from Google Cloud Vision AI to automatically label the picture we captured and identify the most relevant feature in it. 
We then used Spotify API to query playlist most relevant to the feature. The user interface is a webpage built on Django framework and we're planning to develop it into Android App.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had a hard time integrating it into an Android App and we are all unfamiliar with the integration of the components into the website.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made used of Google API effectively to successfully identity relevant feature and learned a lot from combining different APIs together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Go Go Music
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will train the model using data from ourselves and use accelerometer and location data to provide customized suggestions.
