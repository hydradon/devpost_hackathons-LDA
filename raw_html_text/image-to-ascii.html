                    Brainstormed with Renjing Yin to come up with the idea of working on translating an image into an ASCII txt file. We coded it in Java and implemented the pixel to ASCII conversion with different logics; that is why we are uploading them seperately for evaluation. Work was done without using libraries other than basic Java file I/O and awt API's.
