                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is hard for developers who are unfamiliar with Ethereum and Hyperledger Besu to get started with developing an end-to-end application that uses smart contracts.  They would need to learn the intricacies of setting up each component in their development environment, look through endless tutorials, sample projects and documentation that focus on individual components instead of all of the technologies together, and struggle with trial end error to get a basic end-to-end scenario working.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We aim to improve this experience by providing generators using different technologies to create sample projects that encompass and provide the entire development stack.

                <p>
                    This project contains two generators that make it easy for developers to start developing apps on Hyperledger Besu.

                    besu-maven-archetype
                    <br>
                    We created a sample project that installs Hyperledger Besu as part of the build, configures it for local development, compiles Solidity contracts using web3j-maven-plugin, builds the project through Maven, and runs the application that connects to the Hyperledger Besu node through web3j.  The application deploys a basic smart contract through Besu and calls a function.
                    <br>
                    We then converted it into a Maven archetype using the maven-archetype-plugin.

                    <br>
                    We used the sample project created from our Maven archetype above, and added it as a template in a new Appsody stack by following the the steps in the

                        Appsody stacks doc
                    </a>
                    .  In addition, we created Dockerfiles that define how the stack and project are built and how local directories are mapped into the container, so that the entire development runtime (Besu, Java, Maven) reside within the container.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Hyperledger Besu documentation was very in depth and detailed, however the setup was very complicated for our team to figure out.  The required steps for a development type environment are scatted throughout different pages and sections, and the client requires many non-default options to enable a development type scenario.  Thus we needed to use trial-and-error and look around the docs and command line help output for solutions at each stage of our progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We could not find any sample projects that make use of web3j and Hyperledger Besu together, even though this seems like a reasonable scenario for Java developers working with Ethereum.  Various tutorials and even the Besu docs refer to Truffle, web3.js, and/or solc, which while all are useful tools for development, should not be a requirement in a native Java environment.
