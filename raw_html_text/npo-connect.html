                </h2>
                <p>
                    We have seen at various occasions where non profit's are not able to scale their events in lack of funds, manpower or even experience. With our tool we will be able to eliminate that. Also, knowing the fact that gen z is interested in social causes, this was a huge market opportunity for us.
