                    3x3 grid each with a unique number.
You start with the number your tile is on. Your goal is a target number.
You can swipe up to add, down to subtract, left to multiply, and right to divide.
You cannot return to the space you just left.
You lose if you go out of the 0-255 range.
You win if you reach the target number
