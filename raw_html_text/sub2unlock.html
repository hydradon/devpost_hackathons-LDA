                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I am a content creator. I saw that people downloaded the work I was giving away without supporting me. So, I created this website which allows the content creator to lock their work and make the downloaders to complete those steps and gain access to the work of content creators.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It makes content creator to give access to the content they give for free to others who complete the steps shown in the website. It could be like "Subscribe to youtube" or "Tweet it" etc. Same like Gleam.io but instead of the reward thingy, it gives the content the content creator wanted to give to others.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I built this site using Laravel, a PHP framework . It is backed by Mysql and redis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had to fix up various database clutters. Errors that gave no way to trace back were killed. Had to re-structure my database cause the first one I created wasn't up-to-the-mark
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Made the whole website with few lines of code. Made it as secure as possible with CSRF protection, XSRF protection and stuffs.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned deep about Laravel and it's APIs. I could master in Eloquent, a Laravel's own god-sent ORM. That was really fabulous
