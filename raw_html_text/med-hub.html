                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration behind our project is the need for emerging tech in the health industry.  Our team often tackles medical problems at hackathons to serve a social good, and we knew we wanted this project to be no different.  The inspiration behind this project truly comes from the passion for learning on top of personal experiences.  One of our team members spent about a week in the hospital last summer and she noticed that the way the doctors and nurses communicated about change in medicine prescriptions, dosages, and treatment options was disorganized.  This Smart Medical Cabinet and software suite brings back efficiency and good communication in hospitals.  In addition, no one on this team has truly worked on a hardware project before, as we are all Software Engineers, so using the Raspberry Pi was a learning experience to say the least.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Med Hub is a Smart Medical Cabinet with a built in software based lock system.  It starts with the doctor.  As the doctor meets with his patients he can view how a patient's therapy and care is going based on his tracking of how the patient is reacting to the treatment using our Android Application.  This first application allows doctors to update prescriptions for each patient as well as view the patient's medication schedule.  The mobile Android Application comes fully equipped with a built in medical database of various medications for various uses for the doctors to reference if needed and so they can better answer patient questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next step is the pharmacist.  Once the doctor inputs patient data and medicine dosages, that data will be sent to Firebase where we are storing our data and then sent back down to the Web Application built with Bootstrap and JavaScript.  The pharmacist can view what the patient needs and when they need them based on the doctors requests, as well as see updates made by the doctor on the same day rather than get the information lost in a paper trail or chain of voices.  The pharmacist will have to input the patient's name, medicine name, dosage, and time the medication was given out.  If the patient had already received medications that day, then the medicine cabinet will remain locked and will output an error for the pharmacist.  If not, then the medicine cabinet will unlock, leveraging the Raspberry Pi technology and a servo.  In addition, as a visual signal, we leverage iLumi, so that when the cabinet is locked the light will display red and when the cabinet is unlocked, the light will display green.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this system, we leverage smart lighting, hardware, mobile applications, and a web applications all making up a single suite of complete software for doctors in hospitals all across the world.

                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Med Hub was built on various platforms as a software and hardware suite of tools for hospitals.  The Smart Medicine Cabinet lock was built using a Raspberry Pi and a servo for proof of concept.  The mobile application used by the doctor was built using Android Studio for the Android Platform.  The web application was built using Bootstrap, javascript, HTML5, and CSS3, in addition to Firebase to store all patient data with a python based back end.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main challenge we ran into was with the hardware.  A lot of the hardware was incompatible with each other and put us behind on our project significantly.  With little experience in hardware, the debugging process took more than usual, but the learning experience was tremendous.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Med Hub
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since we created a Smart Lock that in this case is only being used with a software suite for medical records and prescriptions, the hardware aspect of our project can be implemented in the financial industry as well as healthcare to protect other forms of records and personal information.  Our next steps with Med Hub are the expand the scope of this project to provide more use cases in different fields and offices.
