                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We heard about the competition to create a domain using domain.com and we came up with, what we feel is, a great idea.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It exists as a domain on the internet
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We obtained the domain through domain.com
                </p>

                    Challenges we ran into

                <p>
                    Brainstorming to create what we felt would be the best domain name.

                <p>
                    coming up with the idea of a domain that hadn't been registered yet
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that it's somewhat difficult to come up with great puns using .com, .net, and .org
                </p>

                    If we find a great use for our site, we will definitely make sure to put it to good use
