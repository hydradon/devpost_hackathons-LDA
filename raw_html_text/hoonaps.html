                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted to create an app that shows students around campus good places to nap. Locations can be added by any student so that a large collection of locations is collected.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Motivation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    UVA expects students to strive for excellency. Because of this, there is a lot of coursework and pressure to participate in extracurriculars, often leading to poor scheduling and bad sleep schedules. We felt it would be convenient for students to be able to determine good spots around grounds to take a nap during empty time blocks between classes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    HooNaps shows locations around UVA, added by students, that are comfortable or suitable for napping. Locations are shown as markers on Google Maps, including a name, building, floor, description, among other information.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Django was used as an integrated framework for this app. Google Maps was integrated, with the ability to add and remove custom markers. Python is the underlying language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the group members knew how to use any of the technologies used for this project before today's hackathon, especially Django.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We created a mostly demo-able project with almost no background knowledge beforehand. The app is something we could see ourselves, as well as other students, using during daily life at UVA.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for HooNaps
                </h2>
                <p>
                    User authentication/authorization, location approval by administrators
