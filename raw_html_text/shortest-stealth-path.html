                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, my team tried to build an environment simulator in which we simulate open world with animals. The further we got into brainstorming, my team and I became particularly interested in the concept of the predator hunting the prey in nature.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A map is generated with the predator one one side of the map and the prey on the other.The map is also full of obstacles that can't be crossed but can used to hide behind.The predator knows where his prey is. He has to find the shortest path to his prey that doesn't allow him to get spotted by the prey. The predator will use the obstacles to his advantage. 
The prey isn't aware of the prey unless the predator cross his line of sight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is applicable to areas like hostage situations in which the police must quickly reach the hostages without getting spotted by the terrorists.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Built from C# and Unity. The map is generated by a 2D int array. Every element in the array is either a 1,2,or 3. 1 means the place on the map has no obstacle. 2 means there's a obstacle. 3 means there's no obstacle but is within the line of sight of the prey. 
The predator finds its path using out custom A* algorithm. In order for the predator to reach his target, he must first reach a series of obstacles to hide behind. Each obstacle is a "sub-target". The predator chooses his next obstacle that's both closest to him and to the prey. The path the predator takes to the obstacles becomes his path to his prey.

                <p>
                    Getting the predator to move properly.

                <p>
                    Being able to stay up for 24 hours coding and getting the project done. Successfully gave up sleep.

                    What's next for Shortest Stealth Path
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to expand on the Shortest Stealth Path Algorithm and use it to build a environment simulator in which we simulate a open world with animals.
