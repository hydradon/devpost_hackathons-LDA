                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like playing D&amp;D with our friends, but if the party disagrees on something, it often results in one half of us doing something while the other does nothing. This tool allows the DM in charge to multitask and manage multiple different sub-groups at once.
                </p>

                    Simulates a town with Non-Playable Characters(NPCs) and player characters in a primarily text based enviroment.

                    Working in Eclipse, sharing the project through Github, spliiting it into parts and tackling each part individually.
