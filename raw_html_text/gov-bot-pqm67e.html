                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had learned about the issues with lack of civic involvement, especially at the state level, but what set the decision for us what the versatility and ability of the Phone2Action API and the impacts it could have on the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our chat bot aims to get the silent 52% of US residents involved in local policy making by making bill information easily accessible and making contacting legislators an ease.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used the ProPublica API to get the recent bills. We used the Phone2Action API to get the proper legislator from the user&rsquo;s address and to contact said legislator. The bot aspect of it was done using Python 3 and the fbchat API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Creating the logic flow and the integration of multiple apis into a single chat bot
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Managing to learn the ins and outs of two new APIs to create a piece software which has a very unique yet huge impact on the community.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Proper use of different API&rsquo;s in the Python programming language.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Gov Bot
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We&rsquo;d like to expand this to include real-time alerts so people don&rsquo;t have to check with the bot, the bot can just check with them.
