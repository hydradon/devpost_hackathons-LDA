                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We like building cool AI's for games, but we wanted to make it even easier for a human to play with a bot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Its a Poker AI that plays Texas Hold'em Poker. It can detect its own cards as well as the draw to determine what move to make each turn.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used a Raspberry Pi camera to take pictures of the game. The pictures are fed into an ML-model built using Google Cloud's Auto-ML to translate into computable data. This data is then fed into the Poker's AI algorithm which then determines what move to make.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our initial goal was to use facial cues of opponents as an input to the Poker's AI so it could factor in the human element of Poker into it's decision making. However, Google's Vision API was not powerful enough to detect subtle changes in facial appearances that occur in a game of Poker.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Image recognition of individual playing cards! Google's Auto-ML was incapable of this so we had to collect a lot of data to train our own model to accomplish this.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    How to use a Raspberry Pi, specifically its camera, to do cool stuff.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Poker Player
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Improving the AI. We focused more on the human element of the project so we could certainly improve the actual AI. We also want to integrate speech-to-text using Google Cloud so the AI can keep track of the game progression by listening to the other players' moves.
