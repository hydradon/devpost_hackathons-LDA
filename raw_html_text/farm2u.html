                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I decided to do this project because it helps both the consumers and the producers. This projects aim was to both support local farmers and their families as well as provide consumers with fresh organic produce. Nowadays there has been a growth in the number of people who are health conscious. Unfortunately not all of them are able to get fresh organic food. Though supermarkets may carry organic produce, you have no way of knowing when it was picked. This leaves farmers markets as the only way of getting guaranteed fresh organic produce. However not everyone has a schedule flexible enough to go to farmers markets, which are often only once or twice a week and are not held everywhere. Also on the farmers side they may not be able to sell their produce to people because they lack necessary logistics, finances, volume or infrastructure. So I decided to create an application and website to provide the infrastructure the farmers need and give the consumers the ability to buy the farmers' produce online. Also not only would this project help farmers with making their produce available to interested buyers, but also this would provide a delivery service. This delivery service would work by Farm2U having a few drivers who would go out and buy produce when it is ordered by consumers through the website and then have it delivered to the consumers door.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website has information about Farm2U, our vendors and a store from which consumers can buy food using google pay. The application that the farmers would use requires that new farmers that are joining the Farm2U vendor family would have to create an account with basic information about their produce and their farm. The application also assigns farmers a unique vendor id to ensure that produce is bought from a variety of vendors instead of just one. The farmers also send weekly updates to Farm2U so the website always is up to date.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The website is built in HTML and CSS. The application was built in Android Studio and it leverages Google Firebase for managing all the different vendors.

                <p>
                    Have the farmers notifications be automated. Determine necessary screening processes by which to hire drivers. Move away from using Firebase and create self-hosted servers.
