                <p>
                    Conversational AI services such as Dialogflow, Lex, or Watson Assistant require creation and management of complex conversation trees. State-of-the-art question-answering systems can learn from question/answer pairs but also require passage context as training data and input. We developed a chatbot trained by feeding it with just question/answer pairs. Our chatbot works well without passage contexts and thus is simpler to operationalize. The chatbot does not use word meanings or linguistic properties such as parts-of-speech or stop words. It can work with non-English questions and answers.

                    We used data from Google's Natural Questions posted on the web

                <p>
                    From the data we only use questions and short answers such as these for training the chatbot.

                    The training data is in English but the chatbot can work with other languages by feeding it question-answer pairs in another language. The model does not need to know word meanings or use linguistic features like word stems, parts-of-speech, or stop words.

                    A key feature of our model is attention mechanism. Here is an attention plot of question "where does jinx you owe me a coke come from" with correctly predicted answer.

                    The two questions have different utterances. But the intent is the same, which is to ask about origin of a children's game. Attention mechanism assigns a weight to each word in the question which is then used by the chatbot to predict the next word in the answer.

                    Identifying a useful and efficient collaborative platform. Getting reasonably big data set in a compact form for training and running TF2. The original files were really huge (GBs) and Google-Colabs does not let you store files in the container. So, we adopted the example of 200 data sets, stored only the simplified version (12Mb), and run our code from a Google Drive via the Google-Colabs.

                <p>
                    For the 200 data set we identified 70 short answers out of 101 possible long answers, that is 69% useful training data. After training we got 76 answers (different from 'unknown') out of the 101 possible questions with long answers, that is is 75% (5 new answers). Within this set there were at least 52 correct answers out of the 76 possible non-trivial answers - accuracy rate 68%. The total training time was 11.72 minutes for 100 epochs, final total_loss 0.1290. There were 2 AnswerFlow answers with similarity above 85% based on spacy 'en_core_web_md' similarity comparison to the correct answer. Below are these two examples:

                    1) Use larger data set for training on short answers;
2) Do training for long answers;
3) implement a measure of how reasonable is a given answer;
4) implement a QA skin via webpage, app, or another chatbot interface.
