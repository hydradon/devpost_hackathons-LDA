                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There is this paper, that analyse trypophobia and its negative effects. After seeing this paper, and having a friend with similar experience of fearing clusters of dots, we wanted to create a innovate solution to her fear. Her fear, like many others, is strong enough that she goes out of the way to avoid them. We decided to do this hack to asses and treat people with trypophobia like her.

                <p>
                    Holey is a visual game experience with three purposes:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Determine if you have trypophobia.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Determine your level or trypophobia.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Help you deal with it by gradually increasing the intensity.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into problems of being unable to do our original idea due to javascript contraints and time contraints. Originally, we wanted scrolling interactive website, but due to how our particles work, we decided to go in a different approach. This lead us to a just as satisfiable result of standing out and bringing out the fear to people.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The visuals are actually pretty scary as we tested it on many hackers. We also are proud of our facial detection system, where it would detect the location of the face and determine if the user is done with the test by their distance from the screen.
