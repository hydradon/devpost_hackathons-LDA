                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    College has a plethora of events to explore.  We wanted a way for students to stay up to date on events going on around campus.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app allows the user to view posted events as well as post their own.  the experience is completely anonymous.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used android studio and created our servers through firebase.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We ran into trouble with syncing progress from different users together.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud to have been able to build an app in this small time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot from each other when it came to working with android studio, which i have never worked in.
                </p>

                    We hope to streamline the app and create a better user experience.
