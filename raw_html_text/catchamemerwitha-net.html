                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    My Brother has social anxiety, and I spent the entirety of my high school experience trying to get him active, but it wasn&rsquo;t until his history made him team up to make a political cartoon, did he meet his girlfriend. Over the course of the project they bonded, and he was finally comfortable hanging around other people. I wanted to take this experience and share it with as many people as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We provide a service that allows people to be creative and find other people, who they have similar personalities too. This provides an opportunity for people with social anxiety to express themselves and helps them be more comfortable with person that they are.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We utilized the Amazon Web services that MLH offered their hackers and we hosted our custom domain through domain.com.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Using Amazon Web services in conjunction with domain.com, they do not allow the domain to route to the AWS web server for 24 hours. So 24 hours from 4 am with tech support it will be linked to our actual site. We had to adjust our plans several times in order to make the goal achievable in the best manner. We then ran into many back end issues with the Site, as we tried to expand our idea to the best of our abilities.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first time we did anything on a backend side of web development, but we were able to learn what we needed in order to get an operational concept. We are proud that we chose to do something that we loved and that it helps people like my brother.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about web development and the integration with Javascript, and how to get parts of a webpage to work with each other. We also learned about Amazon web services and plan to stick with it in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for catchamemerwitha.net
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to go back to Android Studio and make an app available in the app store for Memer. We also have been working to build a match algorithm as friend suggestions, to connect Memer&rsquo;s to people with similar personality. We also plan on hosting our College&rsquo;s Engineering Club web page using amazon web services.
