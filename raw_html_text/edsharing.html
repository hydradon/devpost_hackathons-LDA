                    The chances of success and integration into society of a person is drastically increased with literacy, which can be difficult to obtain for a refugee fleeing towards unfamiliar land with a different language. We plan to get refugees on their feet faster by providing an easy to use mobile app on which they are able to practice the written language of a potential host country, so that upon arrival, they are able to navigate the new country.
                    <br>
                    This app instructs the user on what to write in the learning option, and the practice option provides longer practice problems.

                    LiterWrite lets the user chose the language (oriented towards refugees) they want to learn to write, then provides two options:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            LEARN
                        </strong>
                        provides animations for the most basic building blocks of a language, then proceeds when the user can handwrite the letters.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            PRACTISE
                        </strong>
                        presents a timed challenge, counting score for each correct handwriting that corresponds to the on-screen vocabulary.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>

                        </strong>
                        lets users choose the language they want to learn to write again.
                        <br>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    LiterWrite began with research on written language api's. Myscript was chosen as the optimal tool for handwriting recognition, so it was integrated for identifying user input. Piecing together LiterWrite with the api took place over the duration of the night and debugging began early morning. So far, the learning and practice features have both been implemented.
                </p>
                <h2>

                <p>
                    Android studio was ... difficult to work with in general. The Myscript api took some trial and error to work, which costed us hours in the night. Because of android's massive catalog of classes and features, it took some research to make LiterWrite compile and run. As usual, debugging took a long time as well.
                    <br>
                    We were proud of being able to create a working prototype of an educational mobile platform. We learned a lot about the android framework and the Myscript api, both of which look to be highly valuable assets in the future.

                <p>
                    We plan on expanding the language range for our app and providing a centralized data distribution system so that lesson plans can be pushed to and stored in devices in the future for expanded learning options offline. Specs for lesson plans will be implemented later on, which can potentially be open sourced in order to provide a more robust learning experience.
