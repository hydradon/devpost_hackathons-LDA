                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Hackathon theme was "Rewind" and that made us think about the original Oregon Trail PC game from our childhood.
                </p>

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's a text based game with random events that happen in between class weeks. There are times when the user has to pick whether to study in the library or computer lab and so forth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    C++, repl.it
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Realizing that there were a lot of things to consider to make an interesting and well balanced game. Also, real life keeping us busy and not having a lot of time.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting a working game going despite lack of time. :)
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Oregon trail was a complicated game for its time and it was fun to think about the challenges the original game makers must have had.
                </p>

                    What's next for Oregon State Trail
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Would really like to add some graphics and a "game" part to it, sort of like the hunting feature in the original.
