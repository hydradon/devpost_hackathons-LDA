                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Having complete control of mobile devices when wearing heavy construction equipment
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It is supposed to recognize hand gestures and translate to mouse movements on a mobile device
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I used openCV, Google, Stack Over Flow and a bunch of other python libraries to put everything together
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *Image filtration is almost impossible to do with a dynamic background, at my current level of knowledge.
*Learning new libraries.
