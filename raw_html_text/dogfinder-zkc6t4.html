                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing is a better de-stressor than petting a cute dog. This is a way to connect dog lovers, or students who want to improve their mental health by petting a furry animal, to dog owners, who are willing to have their dogs pet. We were inspired by the challenge of creating a website that connects people and animals to improve health.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can sign up as the dog owner, allowing others to track your pooch and show him some love!
Can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t have a dog of your own? You can track all the furry friends around you whenever you&rsquo;re in need of that puppy love!
Maybe you are a dog owner and want to get your dog socialized - sign up as both!

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used HTML and CSS to build a website, and AWS to host it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are mostly beginners so it was challenging for us to learn HTML and CSS and learn the basic layout of a website.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Publishing the website on the internet!!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to code in HTML/CSS, how to collaborate on GitHub, how to setup a domain name, how to set up a KOA server, and how to host our site on AWS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for DogFinder
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We want the website to be more dynamic and store user data. We want to incorporate APIs so that dog seekers can receive notifications when there is a dog nearby to pet. There will also be a map showing nearby dogs' locations
