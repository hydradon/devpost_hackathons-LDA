                    The main difficulty was implementing what we wanted into the program with the syntax that twine provides. The formatting and commands were strange and hard to get used to, but we had adapted by the end of the day. There was a lot of deleting and restarting from scratch, especially since many of the approaches we took ended up failing. The final and current version is the one we am most satisfied with, and we believe it is exactly what we could have asked for.

                    Our art providers worked diligently throughout the entirety of the day, and we can thank them for their lovely contributions.
