                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have little experience programming, but I love using my Echo and Echo Dot, so I wanted to create a skill. This, combined with my passion for math gave me the idea to make a game that kids would enjoy -- solving addition problems.

                <p>
                    After randomly generating 2 integers between 0 and 25, the program calculates the sum and checks it with the user. If the user succeeds, it congratulates the user. Otherwise, it tells the correct answer.

                    I built it using the Flask-Ask Framework which I learned how to use from

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did not know any programming prior to this and did not understand the syntax, so it took time to get acquainted with the language and Python, which was the simplest language available.

                <p>
                    I am proud of producing my first successful program and a chance to make something for Alexa, which I frequently depend upon and use.

                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to program with Python and the syntax with Flask-Ask and Alexa.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would like to make new apps with Learn Division, Subtraction, and Multiplication, or combine them into an updated version of this skill. Also, I will try and add an update to include an explanation that explains how to add two numbers given the two randomly generated values.
