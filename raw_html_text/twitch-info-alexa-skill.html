                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Twitch is cool, but sometimes we want to know what is available to watch before we start watching.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This skill will help people by providing info such as the most popular games, top streamers for a game, top streamers live, or stream info for a particular streamer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For the backend, Ryan worked on receiving requests from Alexa and sending back messages.  Scott and Theo worked on receiving info from Twitch API.  Theo also worked on the voice commands for Alexa in the Alexa dev console
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting info from the Twitch API was difficult because we had little experience with using developer APIs in the past.  In addition, it was hard to import libraries into the AWS lambda node, but we figured it out with some help from the Amazon booth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We finished the whole project in time and was able to add a few additional commands.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about JavaScript, especially about certain syntax and asynchronous functions.  Also, making an Alexa skill was a completely new experience, and we plan to continue developing more skills in the future.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Twitch Info Alexa Skill
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We really want to implement our first idea which was to read Twitch chat since sometimes people can't access Twitch chat, a very important component to what makes a Twitch stream entertaining. We think we can get this implemented within the next week if we had more time.
