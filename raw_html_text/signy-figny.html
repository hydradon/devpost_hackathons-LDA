                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I take birthcontrol. The apps I use to track my period/remind me to take the pill everyday don't let me see if I marked yes or no.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technically it has ticker boxes that a seperated by weeks for each day.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I did it in Android Studio with the help of several people. Alexis Lopez helped me start off the project. Chad Schultz guided me through some challenges often. I attended the the Android Studio Workshop and I learned a little bit off the presentation and the extra mentors there helped me as I worked on the project. I started on one file, and it ended up being split into two files that both went into errors. So to at least present the idea I wanted to achieve, I animated it in PowerPoint, where the buttons work to send you form home page to other weeks and clicking allows you tick boxes.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I had trouble setting up the program itself since I have never worked with Android Studios nor did I know any Java. Then I kinda got the hang of it and the buttons decided they didn't want to work. I also never was fully able to set up the days to the weeks.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I kinda know my way around Android Studios now. I'm not profficient enough to teach others, but I know enough where maybe I could do a project on my own with the help of the internet.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to write some Java and read it. I also learned how finicky coding is, but mainly I learned that maybe I should focus more on hardware, and not really beat myself up for not knowing to code because it's something I figured I wasn't too interested in.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Signy Figny
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If I figure out how to get the program the work the way I intended it to, I would probably figure out how to get it in my phone so I could use it. Other additions I would like to see for Signy Figny is a timestamp of when the action was completed and the ability to log the twentyeight weeks cycle data without loss.
