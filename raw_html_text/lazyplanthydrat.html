                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Previously having plants of our own and over time progressively killing each plant one by one due to negligent watering practices. We wanted to devise a solution for those who falls into the same category but enjoy being in the presence of plants.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This alpha prototype provides heat, light, and water to a mid-sized plant such as a flower. The heat is able to provide warmth for the plant in cold ambient air such as that of during the night. The light provides an extra source of energy for the plant to grow, and the water is able to help the plant in its growth.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We developed an Android app to act as a controller for a bluetooth-enabled Arduino; the Arduino's output signals are fed through additional power and drive circuits to power a 100 W Peltier plate, a high-efficiency LED array, and a ultrasonic piezoelectric element.
