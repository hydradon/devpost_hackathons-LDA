                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our project was inspired by my curiosity of the Myo Armbands and how it can be applied to create a language. I remembered seeing a morse code tree, and thus, it sparked the idea to create a device that allows users to type, without a keyboard. Our vision of MyoType is for it to improve the lives of impairment people.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The MyoType utilizes the Myo Gesture Control Armband to empower people with fine-motor impairments to type. It maps arm movements to controls that allow the user to select alphanumeric characters and punctuation.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built this application with the Myo Armband SDK and C++. The typing system is based on a binary tree containing characters needed in basic and intermediate sentences. Through persistent experimentation, we devised general cardinal spaces that are mapped to controls that navigate the binary tree.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At first, our project was creating a study group finder; however, halfway through the hackathon, we realized that we were not making any significant progress on that project. Hence; we made the decision as a team to begin working on our new project, the MyoType. In our new project, we ran into issues where the arm movements were not recognized consistently, nor accurately.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to realize that we were not making progress on the first project, and made the challenging decision to start a whole project anew.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our front-end developers learned to use BootStrap to create the information site and the back-end developers used the Myo Armband SDK for their first time.
                </p>
