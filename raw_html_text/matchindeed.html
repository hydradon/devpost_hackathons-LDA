                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Find the true love is as difficult as find a job. While searching for a good career why not seek love as the same time?
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built a website that shows your potential important other half geographically.
Our site uses result from large amounts of data parsed from.
We used indeed API to grab occupations and their distribution.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We divided the work into front-end and back-end.
                    <br>
                    The front-end focused on getting the type suggestion and heat map of your potential spouse.
                </p>

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Callback hell from javascript, we solved this by using a debugger to track through the code flow
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Getting the right source of data is not easy either, we eventually cited a post linked to HackerNews site.
                        <br>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are really proud that given we deliberately picked an area that we are not familiar with and bravely stepping out 
of our comfort-zone and have a nicely working prototype under time pressure.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned more about front-end development, both the problem and challenge and existing solutions.
We learned that having the same goal for a team is crucial to delivering good quality software.
                </p>

                    What's next for MatchIndeed

                <p>
                    We currently only supports state level information, we would love to take it to the next level and construct
a finer granularity distribution visualization.
