                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I live in a housing co-op at my school. It takes our work duty coordinators 3 hours to optimize by hand the work duty assignments for the semester. Last semester, I took an optimization class where I learned that a computer could do this assignment in just seconds, potentially saving the coordinators a lot of trouble.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Takes in a CSV file and returns an optimal schedule using a Julia-language linear optimization program.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Wrote code in Julia and attempted to push it onto web.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, my hardware wouldn't allow me to set up a local web server to demonstrate a functional UI. I also didn't complete as many survey experiments as I wanted to.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The work duty coordinators are going to save a lot of time next academic year!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that Julia is not a very robust programming language! I also need to get better hardware.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Expand to work duty coordinator from kitchen coordinator. Make it more user-friendly.
