                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Budgeting in college is tough, and having someone you could ask 24/7 about the state of your bank account on the familiar FB messenger would make it just a bit easier. FB messenger is a popular platform that you often have open on your phone already.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Right now the bot tells you for bank account status. I plan to add more intellegent behavior in the form of financial recommendations. The platform would give you advice on spending habits and give tips that sound like they could have come from a real person instead of just a bot.

                <p>
                    There are some security concerns when dealing with banking information that have not been fully addressed yet. I planned to implement PIN verification to handle this for read-only permissions.
