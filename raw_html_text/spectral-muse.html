                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted to use my brain.  I wanted to make some cool graphics stuff.

                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Muse device connects to your phone.  Metal renders some graphics.  Muse streams some data into the
metal graphics pipeline.  Colors.  Psychedelic shapes.  You know, the Werks.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I've been working on a graphics library with Metal, called

                        Spectra
                    </a>
                    and
working with the Muse peripheral seemed like fun.  I've been doing a lot of similar stuff with audio lately and the
interface seemed similar.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I needed to write more Objective-C than I wanted.  Because of that, I couldn't really interface with libMuse.a as
easily as i would have liked.  There's probably a better way to do this though.

                    Keep it simple.  This seems to be a lesson that I miss, all the time, everytime.

                <p>
                    It's gonna be hard to work on, since I don't own one.  But a device like this would be a lot of fun to mess around with.
