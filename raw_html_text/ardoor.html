                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by our daily shopping needs, where basically one would need to buy a list of things as fast as possible.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It reads current user's location, and upon their input of required items, it shows the shortest route around all the items' locations.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is mainly implemented using ARKit2 framework in iOS platform, integrated with a shortest-path algorithm to come up with the best route to navigate.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first challenge we ran into was getting everyone to understand the idea. The concept itself might be easy to get, but explaining the technology and how it solves our problem was not . Technically, allocating items locations and adapting the outputs into ARKit2 coordinate system, simple xyz-plane, was difficult. Using some trigonometric equations was the only solution to convert the locations to simple xyz-plane points.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1- Developing a fully functional prototype which illustrates the main idea.
2- Provide a simple and easy to use user-interface in the application.
3- Make use of AR technology in a best possible use-case.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    1- Teamwork
2- Getting more experienced in AR technology.
3- Getting to know more about Geo systems.

                    What's next for CARTY
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We feel ambitious and want to take CARTY to the next level by collecting more data which expresses customers habits. This gives us the ability to provide users with a better seamless shopping experience, and retailers with insightful knowledge about customers needs.
