                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before the rise of booking travel on the internet, it was common to go to friendly neighborhood Travel Agent to plan your trip. Our idea is to create an app for the Amazon echo that brings back that experience.

                    What it does

                <p>
                    Before the rise of booking travel on the internet, it was common to go to travel agent to plan your trip. Our idea is to create an app for the Amazon echo that a user could converse with to give the experience of talking to a travel agent. It would be different from a human travel agent in that it would always be available for planning a users trip. It would also benefit the vision-impaired as well by providing a voice-centered user-interface experience.

                    We built it in node.js and the AlexaSkillsKit. We also used the Expedia Natural Language Hotel search API, and Expedia Flight Search API, and Suggestions and Resolutions API. We also utilized the Amazon AWS lambda service.
