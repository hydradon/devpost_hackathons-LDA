                    In a comical way, a group of college students making an app to find free food within the given area is quite charming. It's what you would typically expect from a group of starving and poor college students. However, our toolset can and should be utilized for much more than it's initial purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Formally, our toolset filters and parses your email listings using natural language processing (complex regular expression and string matching as well as recurrent neural networks trained from various datasets) in a search for organizations or events that are hosting free food. It will tag and track the location, time and date, and what food will be available and display that information it a "quick to read" format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a college student, with a few quarters in their pockets, looking for a free meal, to a community church or local food bank organizer scanning popular email listings know for providing "free food" events, this toolkit reduces the hours of mental labor it would take to read hundreds of emails down to a few seconds and displays the information you need.
