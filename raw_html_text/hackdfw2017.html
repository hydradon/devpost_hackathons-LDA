                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It has become increasingly important to be informed about what is going on in the world. However, actively searching out world views on the internet can be very time consuming. Therefore, we decided to give a WorldView of any topic at a glance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The user can search for a twitter hashtag and the data visualization shows the general twitter sentiment of the hashtag to the user. The green, blue, and white colors correspond to a positive, negative, and neutral sentiment of the hashtag.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used three.js to power the front end data visualization and used flask, python, the Twitter API, and the library tweepy to power the backend and the sentiment analysis.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge we ran into was connecting the data visualization to the search bar, as some of the controls of the visualization clashed with the search input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Connecting the visualization the the sentiment analysis
Speed up tweet query time and sentiment analysis from half a minute to a few seconds
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We became much more comfortable using APIs as well as the libraries that go with them. We also learned a lot about javascript and three.js in particular as a 3D library.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We would like to move the visualization to a more mobile friendly platform as well as allow the users to explore the visualization through virtual reality.
