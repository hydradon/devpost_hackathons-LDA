                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired from Pokemon-Go, we decided to build an AR Game which is based on smart phones.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Players will use their phones as guns to aim and shoot at each other. We built a server to exchange data between different users to enable multi-player. In this game we collect data from compass and GPS of the phone to check whether a player successfully shoot other players.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The app is based on Java and xml (built by android studio), and the server is based on Java. The connection between the server and the smart phone app is through socket.
                </p>
