                    Where can I sleep tonight?: Finding Shelters for Homeless
                </p>
                <p>
                    We use Alexa to find available shelters for homeless in Washington DC.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our vision Smart Cities should give a voice to its most vulnerable, forgotten residents.
By having strategically located Echo devices in the city, our Alexa skill would connect Homeless to social services,
empowering Homeless to interact with local goverment  and providing local goverments with data on homeless issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Use case Scenario:

                        Finding a place to sleep
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        User is a Homeless person walking down the street
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <p>
                        User: Alexa, ask smart city
Alexa: I can help you finding a place to sleep tonight

                        A voice interface might have a psychological positive impact, making homeless feel heard
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Screens are fragile
