                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike conventional Social Media, Ghostly lets people physically explore the city and listen to their neighbor's voice. 
The world we are living in today, we are surrounded by provocative media files coming all around the globe. But when was the last time you walked around the city and listened to what your neighbors have to say? 
We thought it is too late for modern humans to build strong bonds with their neighbors like they used to, so we created this app so people can listen to each others' voice without personally knowing each other. 
This will be an excellent tool to deliver the local culture, history, news and guidance to the person new to the neighborhood.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is a location based audio sharing service. User can select the audio shown on the map which was recorded by an another user in that location. You can select any audio files that were recorded within 5 miles range. You can share audio files in a specific location.
