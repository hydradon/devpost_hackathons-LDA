                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Due to a lack of memes and joy in our lives, we decided to brighten up our Discord channel with a bot that can pull images from
                    <strong>
                        ANY
                    </strong>
                    subreddit, anything from Imgur, top 5 Google results and even a ban words list.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Searches the web using Selenium WebDriver and pulls the full sized images into the Discord Channel for all to enjoy.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Starting out we used Discord.io primarily with JavaScript. After some testing, we decided to swap to Discord.js for more functionality. After even more problems relating to JavaScript, it was decided that we move onto Discord.py and start from there.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Properly implementing the banned words list was a challenge as well as swapping from Discord.io to Discord.js to Discord.py.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Successfully pulling results from the web platforms was a challenge and a fun experience! Lastly, implementing a banned words list was challenging but now banned words can be added to as needed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you can, do it in Python. Also, asynchronous event handling was an incredibly integral tool to get all this to run at the same time.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Smooth Bryan: The Meme Machine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Smooth Bryan has many more roles to fulfill! We plan to make him our full time Discord bot which would include assigning roles, keeping track of users, playing music and proper code display for helping users.
