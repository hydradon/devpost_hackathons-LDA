                    The problem that we try to address through this app is Food Wastage
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is an android application that aids in preventing wastage of food. Once you go to the grocery store all you need to do is take a photo
of your bill.
We will identify all the food items and will give you timely prompts about the expiration date of items.
To reduce wastage, the app will give you suggestions about what food you can cook using the ingredients that are about to expire.
We also give you an option to donate the food away to the needy, by finding the closes charity organizations to your work place or
home.
