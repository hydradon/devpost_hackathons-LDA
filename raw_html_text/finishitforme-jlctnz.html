                    Hackathon are great experiences where we can learn new things and meet new people in exciting new places.
Many good ideas are born in these events, but some never make it further because contestants go back to their occupations and lack time or simply forget about it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    FinishItForMe is a platform allowing us, hackers, to share our ideas with the world so that someone could take over and possibly make the project grow. Most popular projects would gain more visibility and could lead to great community efforts!
A project is presented with a description, some code and idealy a github link for the community to continue the work on the project. Progress will be available for the creator of the idea to see.
