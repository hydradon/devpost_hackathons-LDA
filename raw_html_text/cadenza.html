                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All of us are interested in music, and we thought about creating something that would fall into that category. We came up with the idea of harmonizing vocal inputs and decided to stick with it while also figuring out new functionalities.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cadenza takes in a recording through an ios app and processes that recording by adding different effects. The app first takes the recording and pitch shifts them to the proper note, and then, the user can add different effects to the recording. The first effect is called chord generator. It takes the recording and pitches it up 4 semitones and down 4 semitones and plays the three pitches at once. The second effect is polyphony. The polyphony effect takes the sample pitch shifts it down by 6 semitones and then has the same sample reversed and layered on top. The third effect is called the Circle of Fifths. It takes 3 seconds of the recording and pitch shifts that section of the recording to different keys on the Circle of Fifths.

                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used swift and an API called AudioKit to make the ios app.

                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, swift development is limited to only users who have mac os, and only one person in the group had access to mac os. We also had to redo the project from the ground up several times due to errors in the code. One notable issue was trying to figure out how to use a variable in one class in another class in swift.

                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to record and effects on the recording, and we are also proud about being able to learn swift and the AudioKit API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned a lot about swifts and the specifics of it included functionalities that make it different from other languages and we also learned how to use the AudioKit API and the properties of it.
