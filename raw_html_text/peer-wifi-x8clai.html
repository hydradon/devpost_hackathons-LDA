                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our inspiration are from people surround us that has a huge data usage from their phone carrier but didn't use all of their data by the end of the cycle and the data would go wasted, so we are building a application that would help them get rid of those extra data that they don't need..
