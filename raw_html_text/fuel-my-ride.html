                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    WebApp that calculates how much money you need to fill up your tank based on your personal information, and locates cheapest gas by community input.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built it on Sublime, using JavaScript, CSS, HTML
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We don't have a domain name due to company security issues. Original plan to make FuelMyRide into an iOS app did not go as planned, as we were inexperienced in swift and firebase. Most mentors were also not able to help us as not many had experience with iOS.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We made a nice looking WebApp under a time constraint, seeing as our original plan to make an iOS application fell through
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how to make a WebApp! Seeing as we did not have much experience with JavaScript, CSS and HTML
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for Fuel My Ride
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nicer design, the ability to create a profile that has car information stored, database of car information, etc.
Possibly actually make an iOS app. The app would have the option of real-time maps and a pay for pump option by phone.
