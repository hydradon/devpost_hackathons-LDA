                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Choosing what to do when we have a limited time is a challenge for most. We created What's Next to help those who feel overwhelmed by their tasks and can not decide what to do next.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The main goal of the app is to be a simple and quick user experience. After opening the app, the user can enter the current time they have on hands, and the app will return a random task the user previously put, that matches the time frame.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We built the app using React-Native, which allows it to be compatible with both Android and iOS without having to do cross-platform developing.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of the team members were proficient in react-native, in fact, most of us have never heard of it. So it was overall a challenging experience getting the wheel rolling.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We accomplished to have a presentable application, that we can improve later on. We also are really excited to use the finished app ourselves, so it's a good motivation to work on its completion
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned how react-native works, along with all its dependencies.
                </p>
