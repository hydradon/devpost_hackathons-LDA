                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This isn't an original idea, but it was a running joke between my friends and I from our internship over the summer.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It works just like tinder - swipe functionality, messaging system, profiles, etc.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    It's just a click-through prototype built in Proto.io.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting everything done.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I'm proud that I got a decent amount of functionality out of a relatively limited tool.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Spend more time planning a hack project, and join a team if I want to have more fun.
                </p>

                    What's next for BRAWLER
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Nothing, this app is terrible and I will probably never touch it again.
