                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We were inspired by the chance of creating something that might be beneficial to the animals who were the ones that were affected the most in the Australian fires.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our website allows you to post the location of a stranded or injured animal, which is then sent to the proper agencies for assistance.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Created using Ruby on Rails with some Javascript for the Backend of the site. The front end was coded using HTML and CSS with styling by Bootstrap. Google Maps services were used to display the map on the site, as well as geolocation to provide current location. MySQL was used to manage database.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Javascript and Ruby compatibility issues, some stubborn UI elements.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Geolocation: Being able to locate you and display it was the biggest challenge we faced, but overcame it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Became more familiar with Javascript as well as accessing and using Google Services.
                </p>
