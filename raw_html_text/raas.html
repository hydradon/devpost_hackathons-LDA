                    The desire to find a unification concept around digital receipts:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of RaasDex is to create an exchange where anyone can send or receive a digital receipt. You have one location to store and retrieve all your digital receipts rather than having a bunch of siloed receipts in shoe boxes, file cabinets or scattered all over your email boxes. Think publish/subscribe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's predicted that by 2020 about 450 BILLION transactions will occur every day, and every transaction needs a receipt of some sort. RaasDex will be set up to enable any of the receipts to reach it's proper owner in a digital format.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How it works:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The RaasDex Exchange API will allow retailers, businesses and individuals the ability to publish a digital receipt to the exchange and either of these 2 actions will occur:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1- The exchange will return a QR code (embedded UUID) to the retailer that they can print out on Point-of-Sale slips, printed invoices or included within an email they send out as a receipt. User read read the QR code with mobile device cameras or if an email, click the QR code which has a URL link.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2- If the retailers and businesses can check through the API if a email address is registered on RaasDex, if so, then 
they can make a direct deposit to the user's account.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges I ran into:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Designing the concept, API and app all at the same time, plus hooking up the Exchange API with ContextIO's API.
On the API side, just dealing with CORS.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I have accomplished a lot within this short challenge deadline, but there's a lot more to do.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone seems to have their own made up system for dealing with siloed receipts, the challenge is to build a system that works for the majority.

                    Finish the API, mobile apps and website
