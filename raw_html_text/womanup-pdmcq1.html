                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this app was based on Sheryl Sandbergs "Lean In" where she tackles all the barriers regarding women rising to the top and closing the gender gap.
One of the chapters "Are you my mentor?" stresses the importance of having a mentor in order to succeed.

                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our app facilitates the mentor-mentee relationships by avoiding the "S/he is probably too busy" or "I dont want to waste their time" mind state.

                    Both parties start off by listing what area of profession they are in, location, method of communication, and general interests/skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once they are paired up, only the mentor would be able to start the conversation, in order to ensure that an effective relationship is built between them.
