                    What it does
Our drone and landing had had multiple availabilities. The Drone flies with video capabilities. The intelligent landing pad, which has integrated audio and optical system, communicates with the drone through WIFI/RF modules and responds to the drone&rsquo;s action correspondingly. Ordinary drones available on the market does not have a separate.

                <h2>
                    How I built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The drone was built with carbon fiber airframe and propellers from a kit, with modules from third parties. A 4000mAh power bank, Logitech camera, USB dongle, as well as Raspberry Pi 3B+ as its &ldquo;brain&rdquo;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the landing pad, an aluminum frame was constructed. We created a sound system that talked to the drone and guided its flight to the landing pad for visibility. It consisted of an Arduino sending the signal to the speaker through an amplifier, powered with a 9V battery.

                    Challenges I ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One challenge we ran into was balancing the drone. 
Bucking down the voltage due to limited hardware.
Creating the autonomy of the drone.

                    Accomplishments that I'm proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Tuning the PID controller.
Developing the audio.

                <h2>
                    What I learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When creating the audio system, we learned how to implement low/high pass filters for providing the desired sound. 
We learned how to tune a PID system
