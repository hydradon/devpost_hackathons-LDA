                    Inspiration: A common problem among many college students is finding parking spots; it is not only time consuming but you never know if the parking lot you are at, even has enough spaces.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    What it does: The user will open the app and then be prompted to a screen in which they will simply click the button that corresponds to the parking lot they are in. Next to the button is a number count, that shows how many spaces have been taken up. For the sake of this project, we assigned each parking lot to simply have 5 available spaces. For example, if the user clicks on the button labeled P1, then the count will go from 5/5 to 4/5.

                    How we built it: We used Android Studio to build an android app
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into: All of us are new to Android-Studio and have little to no experience with coding. We were learning as we went. We had to not only learn how to use the Kotlin code, but we learned a lot about Android-Studio.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Learning new formulas and how to get the program set up was challenging. We also wanted to add Fire Base but we struggled a lot with it and by the end we didn't have enough time to implement it.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of: We are proud to simply get the app up and running; it is very basic and we could improve it a lot more, but considering how little experience we had, we were happy to see it do what it needed to do.

                <h2>
                    What's next for Parking Pal: We wanted to add the bear-bus route, so you could easily see through the app when you can catch the bear-bus. Also, possibly adding a map of the school, to make it easy to find which parking lot you want to go to. Also, another extra step is adding another tab or view where the user could click on whatever parking lot they want and it would open up some statistics about that specific parking lot through the week. For example, if they click on P1, and a bar graph would show up with Monday through Friday on the x-axis, and on the y-axis, you could have how full the lot is.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Also make it an app so different campuses can use it and not only OU.
