                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was inspired by file hosting applications such as Dropbox and Mega Unlimited.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What It Does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    streamShare is a web application that allows users to temporarily host a file for fiends and peers to access. With streamShare, users can upload a file to the server and message recipients with a "key" connected to the file.  When uploaded, the file is encrypted and temporarily stored in a database.  Using the key attached to the file, anyone with the key can download the corresponding file until it is shortly removed from storage.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How We Built It
                </h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Front end:
                    </strong>
                    The visuals and structure of streamShare's website was created using with raw html5 and css3.  Functionality and effects were implemented with javascript and jquery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        Back end:
                    </strong>
                    To host the server, our our team used the free cloud platform, Heroku. The back-end of streamShare was made using Node.js, which connected to the javascript of the front-end thanks to the socket.io API.  The database was made using Json. ITFFF was implemented with a Node.js webhook, and allowed us to distribute the keys to the select recipients a user identified.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges We Ran Into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    None of us had experience with any of the languages used beforehand. Node.js and Json can kill.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Despite lacking experience, we managed to create a finished product and learned a lot about web development and the respective languages we used!
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What We Learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps APIs such as React and Bootstrap are optimal when looking to create a quality front-end in a limited time frame.  Making a web application was messy with raw code.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's Next for streamShare
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Bug fixing. The website and application still functions but that doesn't mean there are no kinks that need ironing out! The database is quirky and needs to be optimized.  Hopefully more user-friendly features can be implemented as well.
