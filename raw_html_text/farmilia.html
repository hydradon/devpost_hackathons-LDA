                    Executive Summary:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We at farmilia acknowledge the importance that farmers and farm workers have in our society. They ensure we have food on our table every day and we all benefit when they are working safely and efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to offer a complete system that provides farmers and their supervisors a means to:
&bull; keep track of workers&rsquo; tasks
&bull; keep track of workers&rsquo; heart rates and other basic health demographic information
&bull; keep track of workers&rsquo; locations on the field
&bull; keep track of the conditions under which they are working in
&bull; quickly communicate with their worker&rsquo;s in case of an emergency
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the same time, we want to offer the workers a way to:
&bull; to safely learn new tasks
&bull; keep track of their present tasks
&bull; remind themselves to stay hydrated
&bull; remind themselves when they need to take a few minutes to rest
&bull; keep track of their health
&bull; anonymously report any hazardous or abusive conditions
                </p>
                <p>
                    The key question is:
How can you accomplish this without illegal migrants being intimidated by the seemingly invasive tracking, and data collection?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The farmer will be sold affordable smart phones ($20-$40) and fitbits with heart rate monitors ($150) in conjunction with an application we will be developing ($10). The farmer will then hand out the smartphones and fitbits to the workers every morning and at the end of every shift, the workers return the fitbits and smartphones. Each worker will have their own free account which they can take with them from farm to farm and use as a way to access the app from any phone. If a worker sees/experiences any abusive behavior or hazardous situations they may use the app (which will inform the proper authorities anonymously) or through the farmilia website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Architecture:
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are three aspects of the application. The worker interface, the supervisor / farm owner interface and the server. The worker will be a navie iOS application written in swift using core data to store task information such as GPS coordinates and time stamps. Both the worker and supervisor interfaces will be using local notifications to send push notifications to devices. We also will be creating a Django server to store all this information remotely since there is the constraint of a non persistent internet connection. The server will also have authentication information for both parties and act as a means for supervisors to view the completed and in-progress tasks of their worker.
