                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We got the idea from the board game Life and decided to make a card variant.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Teaches players about how to manage money, loans, credit as well as the advantages and disadvantages.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Java to program/create the game.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had to make objects that had decks and be able to make sure each person/players' deck was the same as everyone else.
                </p>

                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Finishing our first project ever.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned that there are many things to consider with loans, credit, etc. That things must be talked about first before coding.
                </p>

                    Try to finish all its planned features.
