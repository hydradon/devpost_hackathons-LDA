                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever walked around a grocery store, frustrated and unable to find what you're looking for? We wanted to solve this problem by developing an app that would help customers find the exact location of the product they want.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our application is made to be integrated within a grocery or department store to allow customers to search for the exact location of a product they are looking for. They must simply speak the name of the item into the mic, and it will tell them the exact aisle, section of that aisle, and shelf that the item can be found at. On the manager side, they can add products to their shelves by simply logging in and inputting the coordinates of the item.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We designed the app in Android Studio using XML and Java. On the manager side, when they add items to their shelves through the app, the information is appended to the end of a text file on the device with a FileOutputStream. The user can then search this text file using the Android Speech to Text API. If the name of the product is found, it prints the exact location on the screen.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We had trouble integrating the Android Speech to Text API with the app. It was also our first time using Android Studio and XML, so we spent a lot of time on the Internet learning how the two worked.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We're proud that we managed to integrate every part of the project that we initially set out to do. Each member of the team contributed a lot on different aspects of the application, be it in the speech-to-text integration or writing new items to the files.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned the basics of how to use Android Studio and XML to create an application. We also got experience in integrating an API with Android's Speech-to-Text API.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What's next for PinPoint
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We will continue to add features to our application, such as the ability to know the price of your cart before getting to the register.
