                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    From our own experience, finding food while traveling in middle-of-nowhere is a difficult thing to do. We remembered about Uber and Yelp, and thought of making something similar to that where traveller can search for food on the spot.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What it does
                </h2>
                <p>
                    (target user: rural area travelers and local people who have time to serve food)
Traveller: find active local people who can serve food to travelers at that time. Able to eat local food, talk to local people, and experience the local culture/dish for a decent price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Local people: be active when available to serve food for the travelers. Able to communicate with travelers, hear their story, and earn money by making food for them.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    How we built it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We used Android Studio platform to build a mobile application for Android OS. We also used Firebase for storing data.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Challenges we ran into
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Since none of our team members had experience with handling the API, and both have very little to almost no experience with mobile application developing, we had hard time with almost everything.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Accomplishments that we're proud of
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are proud that we were able to show Google map with current location marked on the map, write &amp; read nested data by using Firebase, getting and processing the data from API, and making new markers on the google map.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What we learned
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We learned basic feature we need to do when building a mobile app (adding page, adding button, linking button to a new page, know what to import and where to write code, etc), learned how to handle API, how to debug with Android Studio. We learned too many things in two days that we don't know what to list.

                    reviews and comment features, payment methods, host holiday/event meals using things to do API
