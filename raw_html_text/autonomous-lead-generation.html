                    Inspiration
                </h2>
                <p>
                    For a big city like Calgary, the volume of car ads posted on one of its biggest classifieds sites is so high that it would be difficult if not impossible for a Car salesperson to keep track of them all. Furthermore, time is money; the more time the salesperson spends online, the less time they have for customers in the store. If only there was a way to process the massive volume of ads posted daily without losing your entire day.

                <p>
                    Autonomous Lead Generation (ALG) uses a combination of web automation and neural networks to browse through and reply to ads on one of the largest classified sites in Canada.
