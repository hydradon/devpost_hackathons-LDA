                <p>
                    Our project is that we wanted to use an Android app such that it can automatically cook rice remotely.

                    With the wifi-support of dragonboard with powerful ram memory of snapdragon, we wanted to use Dragonboard over Ardunio for our hardware project.We started by rebooting and reinstalling the system and packages for our dragonboard, and updating to the newest linux system, and successfully implemented a small app using Gpio that controls the light with a touch, which demonstrated that we could move on with the project. We then went on connecting servos to the dragonboard, yet while at 2 am in the midnight, the dragonboard was not working anymore since it cannot poweredup, so we switched to ardunio without a choice. We used Esp32 to connect the ardunio to wifi, but it was a big trouble for us. We developed an android app that sends a special vocal signal from esp32 to the ardunio device which controls the ardunio to do the rest.
